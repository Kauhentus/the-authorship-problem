pray you away why fellows
gods so what do you mean
marry that you shall not speak the prologue sir
why do you hope to speak it
ay and i think i have most right to it i am sure i studied it first
that's all one if the author think i can speak it better
i plead possession of the cloak gentles your suffrages i pray you
are you not ashamed
slid i'll play nothing in the play unless i speak it
why will you stand to most voices of the gentlemen
let that decide it
o no sir gallant you presume to have the start of us there and that makes you offer so prodigally
no would i were whipped if i had any such thought try it by lots either
faith i dare tempt my fortune in a greater venture than this
well said resolute jack
i am content too so we draw first
but will you not snatch my cloak while i am stooping
no we scorn treachery
which cut shall speak it
the shortest is come to the shortest
fortune was not altogether blind in this
now sir i hope i shall go forward without your envy
a spite of all mischievous luck
i was once plucking at the other
stay jack 'slid i'll do somewhat now afore i go in though it be nothing but to revenge myself on the author since i speak not his prologue i'll go tell all the argument of his play afore hand and so stale his invention to the auditory before it come forth
o do not so
first the title of his play is "cynthia's revels" as any man that hath hope to be saved by his book can witness the scene gargaphie which i do vehemently suspect for some fustian country but let that vanish
here is the court of cynthia whither he brings cupid travelling on foot resolved to turn page
by the way cupid meets with mercury as that's a thing to be noted take any of our play books without a cupid or a mercury in it and burn it for an heretic in poetry
pray thee let me alone
mercury he in the nature of a conjurer raises up echo who weeps over her love or daffodil narcissus a little sings curses the spring wherein the pretty foolish gentleman melted himself away and there's an end of her
now i am to inform you that cupid and mercury do both become pages
cupid attends on philautia or self love a court lady mercury follows hedon the voluptuous and a courtier one that ranks himself even with anaides or the impudent a gallant and that's my part one that keeps laughter gelaia the daughter of folly a wench in boy's attire to wait on him these in the court meet with amorphus or the deformed a traveller that hath drunk of the fountain and there tells the wonders of the water
they presently dispatch away their pages with bottles to fetch of it and themselves go to visit the ladies
but i should have told you look these emmets put me out here that with this amorphus there comes along a citizen's heir asotus or the prodigal who in imitation of the traveller who hath the whetstone following him entertains the beggar to be his attendant
now the nymphs who are mistresses to these gallants are philautia self love phantaste a light wittiness argurion money and their guardian mother moria or mistress folly
pray thee no more
there cupid strikes money in love with the prodigal makes her dote upon him give him jewels bracelets carcanets etc
all which he most ingeniously departs withal to be made known to the other ladies and gallants and in the heat of this increases his train with the fool to follow him as well as the beggar by this time your beggar begins to wait close who is returned with the rest of his fellow bottlemen
there they all drink save argurion who is fallen into a sudden apoplexy stop his mouth
and then there's a retired scholar there you would not wish a thing to be better contemn'd of a society of gallants than it is and he applies his service good gentleman to the lady arete or virtue a poor nymph of cynthia's train that's scarce able to buy herself a gown you shall see her play in a black robe anon a creature that i assure you is no less scorn'd than himself
where am i now
come leave at last yet
o the night is come 'twas somewhat dark methought and cynthia intends to come forth that helps it a little yet
all the courtiers must provide for revels they conclude upon a masque the device of which is what will you ravish me
that each of these vices being to appear before cynthia would seem other than indeed they are and therefore assume the most neighbouring virtues as their masking habit i'd cry a rape but that you are children
come we'll have no more of this anticipation to give them the inventory of their cates aforehand were the discipline of a tavern and not fitting this presence
tut this was but to shew us the happiness of his memory
i thought at first he would have plaid the ignorant critic with everything along as he had gone i expected some such device
o you shall see me do that rarely lend me thy cloak
soft sir you'll speak my prologue in it
no would i might never stir then
lend it him lend it him well you have sworn
now sir suppose i am one of your genteel auditors that am come in having paid my money at the door with much ado and here i take my place and sit down i have my three sorts of tobacco in my pocket my light by me and thus i begin
by this light i wonder that any man is so mad to come to see these rascally tits play here they do act like so many wrens or pismires not the fifth part of a good face amongst them all
and then their music is abominable able to stretch a man's ears worse then ten pillories and their ditties most lamentable things like the pitiful fellows that make them poets
by this vapour an 'twere not for tobacco i think the very stench of 'em would poison me i should not dare to come in at their gates a man were better visit fifteen jails or a dozen or two of hospitals than once adventure to come near them
excellent give me my cloak
stay you shall see me do another now but a more sober or better gather'd gallant that is as it may be thought some friend or well wisher to the house and here i enter
upon the stage too
yes and i step forth like one of the children and ask you
would you have a stool sir
ay sir if you'll give me sixpence i'll fetch you one
for what i pray thee
what shall i do with it
will you betray your ignorance so much
why throne yourself in state on the stage as other gentlemen use sir
away wag what would'st thou make an implement of me
'slid the boy takes me for a piece of perspective i hold my life or some silk curtain come to hang the stage here
sir crack i am none of your fresh pictures that use to beautify the decayed dead arras in a public theatre
'tis a sign sir you put not that confidence in your good clothes and your better face that a gentleman should do sir
but i pray you sir let me be a suitor to you that you will quit our stage then and take a place the play is instantly to begin
most willingly my good wag but i would speak with your author where is he
not this way i assure you sir we are not so officiously befriended by him as to have his presence in the tiring house to prompt us aloud stamp at the book holder swear for our properties curse the poor tireman rail the music out of tune and sweat for every venial trespass we commit as some author would if he had such fine enghles as we
well 'tis but our hard fortune
nay crack be not disheartened
not i sir but if you please to confer with our author by attorney you may sir our proper self here stands for him
troth i have no such serious affair to negotiate with him but what may very safely be turn'd upon thy trust
it is in the general behalf of this fair society here that i am to speak at least the more judicious part of it which seems much distasted with the immodest and obscene writing of many in their plays
besides they could wish your poets would leave to be promoters of other men's jests and to way lay all the stale apothegms or old books they can hear of in print or otherwise to farce their scenes withal
that they would not so penuriously glean wit from every laundress or hackney man or derive their best grace with servile imitation from common stages or observation of the company they converse with as if their invention lived wholly upon another man's trencher
again that feeding their friends with nothing of their own but what they have twice or thrice cooked they should not wantonly give out how soon they had drest it nor how many coaches came to carry away the broken meat besides hobby horses and foot cloth nags
so sir this is all the reformation you seek
it is do not you think it necessary to be practised my little wag
yes where any such ill habited custom is received
o i had almost forgot it too they say the umbrae or ghosts of some three or four plays departed a dozen years since have been seen walking on your stage here take heed boy if your house be haunted with such hobgoblins 'twill fright away all your spectators quickly
good sir but what will you say now if a poet untouch'd with any breath of this disease find the tokens upon you that are of the auditory
as some one civet wit among you that knows no other learning than the price of satin and velvets nor other perfection than the wearing of a neat suit and yet will censure as desperately as the most profess'd critic in the house presuming his clothes should bear him out in it
another whom it hath pleased nature to furnish with more beard than brain prunes his mustaccio lisps and with some score of affected oaths swears down all that sit about him "that the old hieronimo as it was first acted was the only best and judiciously penn'd play of europe"
a third great bellied juggler talks of twenty years since and when monsieur was here and would enforce all wits to be of that fashion because his doublet is still so
a fourth miscalls all by the name of fustian that his grounded capacity cannot aspire to
a fifth only shakes his bottle head and out of his corky brain squeezeth out a pitiful learned face and is silent
by my faith jack you have put me down i would i knew how to get off with any indifferent grace
here take your cloak and promise some satisfaction in your prologue or i'll be sworn we have marr'd all
tut fear not child this will never distaste a true sense be not out and good enough
i would thou hadst some sugar candied to sweeten thy mouth
if gracious silence sweet attention quick sight and quicker apprehension the lights of judgment's throne shine any where our doubtful author hopes this is their sphere and therefore opens he himself to those to other weaker beams his labours close as loth to prostitute their virgin strain to every vulgar and adulterate brain
in this alone his muse her sweetness hath she shuns the print of any beaten path and proves new ways to come to learned ears pied ignorance she neither loves nor fears
nor hunts she after popular applause or foamy praise that drops from common jaws the garland that she wears their hands must twine who can both censure understand define what merit is then cast those piercing rays round as a crown instead of honour'd bays about his poesy which he knows affords words above action matter above words
i a who goes there
'tis i blind archer
not in your company hermes except your hands were riveted at your back
why so my little rover
because i know you have not a finger but is as long as my quiver cousin mercury when you please to extend it
whence derive you this speech boy
'tis your best polity to be ignorant
you did never steal mars his sword out of the sheath you
alas your palms jupiter knows they are as tender as the foot of a foundered nag or a lady's face new mercuried they'll touch nothing
go to infant you'll be daring still
what a word is there
why my light feather heel'd coz what are you any more than my uncle jove's pander
a lacquey that runs on errands for him and can whisper a light message to a loose wench with some round volubility
wait mannerly at a table with a trencher warble upon a crowd a little and fill out nectar when ganymede's away
one that sweeps the god's drinking room every morning and sets the cushions in order again which they threw one at another's head over night can brush the carpets call the stools again to their places play the crier of the court with an audible voice and take state of a president upon you at wrestlings pleadings negociations etc
here's the catalogue of your employments now
o no i err you have the marshalling of all the ghosts too that pass the stygian ferry and i suspect you for a share with the old sculler there if the truth were known but let that scape
one other peculiar virtue you possess in lifting or leiger du main which few of the house of heaven have else besides i must confess
but methinks that should not make you put that extreme distance 'twixt yourself and others that we should be said to "over dare" in speaking to your nimble deity
so hercules might challenge priority of us both because he can throw the bar farther or lift more join'd stools at the arm's end than we
if this might carry it then we who have made the whole body of divinity tremble at the twang of our bow and enforc'd saturnius himself to lay by his curled front thunder and three fork'd fires and put on a masking suit too light for a reveller of eighteen to be seen in how now
my dancing braggart in decimo sexto
charm your skipping tongue or i'll what
use the virtue of your snaky tip staff there upon us
no boy but the smart vigour of my palm about your ears
you have forgot since i took your heels up into air on the very hour i was born in sight of all the bench of deities when the silver roof of the olympian palace rung again with applause of the fact
o no i remember it freshly and by a particular instance for my mother venus at the same time but stoop'd to embrace you and to speak by metaphor you borrow'd a girdle of her's as you did jove's sceptre while he was laughing and would have done his thunder too but that 'twas too hot for your itching fingers
i heard you but look'd in at vulcan's forge the other day and entreated a pair of his new tongs along with you for company 'tis joy on you i' faith that you will keep your hook'd talons in practice with any thing
'slight now you are on earth we shall have you filch spoons and candlesticks rather than fail pray jove the perfum'd courtiers keep their casting bottles pick tooths and shittle cocks from you or our more ordinary gallants their tobacco boxes for i am strangely jealous of your nails
never trust me cupid but you are turn'd a most acute gallant of late
the edge of my wit is clean taken off with the fine and subtile stroke of your thin ground tongue you fight with too poignant a phrase for me to deal with
o hermes your craft cannot make me confident
i know my own steel to be almost spent and therefore entreat my peace with you in time you are too cunning for me to encounter at length and i think it my safest ward to close
well for once i'll suffer you to win upon me wag but use not these strains too often they'll stretch my patience
whither might you march now
faith to recover thy good thoughts i'll discover my whole project
the huntress and queen of these groves diana in regard of some black and envious slanders hourly breathed against her for her divine justice on acteon as she pretends hath here in the vale of gargaphie proclaim'd a solemn revels which her godhead put off she will descend to grace with the full and royal expense of one of her clearest moons in which time it shall be lawful for all sorts of ingenious persons to visit her palace to court her nymphs to exercise all variety of generous and noble pastimes as well to intimate how far she treads such malicious imputations beneath her as also to shew how clear her beauties are from the least wrinkle of austerity they may be charged with
but what is all this to cupid
here do i mean to put off the title of a god and take the habit of a page in which disguise during the interim of these revels i will get to follow some one of diana's maids where if my bow hold and my shafts fly but with half the willingness and aim they are directed i doubt not but i shall really redeem the minutes i have lost by their so long and over nice proscription of my deity from their court
pursue it divine cupid it will be rare
but will hermes second me
i am now to put in act an especial designment from my father jove but that perform'd i am for any fresh action that offers itself
well then we part
now to my charge
echo fair echo speak 'tis mercury that calls thee sorrowful nymph salute me with thy repercussive voice that i may know what cavern of the earth contains thy airy spirit how or where i may direct my speech that thou may'st hear
know gentle soul then i am sent from jove who pitying the sad burthen of thy woes still growing on thee in thy want of words to vent thy passion for narcissus' death commands that now after three thousand years which have been exercised in juno's spite thou take a corporal figure and ascend enrich'd with vocal and articulate power
make haste sad nymph thrice shall my winged rod strike the obsequious earth to give thee way
arise and speak thy sorrows echo rise here by this fountain where thy love did pine whose memory lives fresh to vulgar fame shrined in this yellow flower that bears his name
his name revives and lifts me up from earth o which way shall i first convert myself or in what mood shall i essay to speak that in a moment i may be deliver'd of the prodigious grief i go withal
see see the mourning fount whose springs weep yet th' untimely fate of that too beauteous boy that trophy of self love and spoil of nature who now transform'd into this drooping flower hangs the repentant head back from the stream as if it wish'd "would i had never look'd in such a flattering mirror
" o narcissus thou that wast once and yet art my narcissus had echo but been private with thy thoughts she would have dropt away herself in tears till she had all turn'd water that in her as in a truer glass thou might'st have gazed and seen thy beauties by more kind reflection but self love never yet could look on truth but with blear'd beams slick flattery and she are twin born sisters and so mix their eyes as if you sever one the other dies
why did the gods give thee a heavenly form and earthly thoughts to make thee proud of it
why do i ask
'tis now the known disease that beauty hath to bear too deep a sense of her own self conceived excellence
o hadst thou known the worth of heaven's rich gift thou wouldst have turn'd it to a truer use and not with starv'd and covetous ignorance pined in continual eyeing that bright gem the glance whereof to others had been more than to thy famish'd mind the wide world's store so wretched is it to be merely rich
witness thy youth's dear sweets here spent untasted like a fair taper with his own flame wasted
echo be brief saturnia is abroad and if she hear she'll storm at jove's high will
i will kind mercury be brief as time
vouchsafe me i may do him these last rites but kiss his flower and sing some mourning strain over his wat'ry hearse
thou dost obtain i were no son to jove should i deny thee begin and more to grace thy cunning voice the humorous air shall mix her solemn tunes with thy sad words strike music from the spheres and with your golden raptures swell our ears
slow slow fresh fount keep time with my salt tears yet slower yet o faintly gentle springs list to the heavy part the music bears woe weeps out her division when she sings
droop herbs and flowers fall grief and showers our beauties are not ours o i could still like melting snow upon some craggy hill drop drop drop drop since nature's pride is now a wither'd daffodil
now have you done
done presently good hermes bide a little suffer my thirsty eye to gaze awhile but e'en to taste the place and i am vanish'd
forego thy use and liberty of tongue and thou mayst dwell on earth and sport thee there
here young acteon fell pursued and torn by cynthia's wrath more eager than his hounds and here ah me the place is fatal
see the weeping niobe translated hither from phrygian mountains and by phoebe rear'd as the proud trophy of her sharp revenge
nay but hear but here o here the fountain of self love in which latona and her careless nymphs regardless of my sorrows bathe themselves in hourly pleasures
stint thy babbling tongue
fond echo thou profan'st the grace is done thee
so idle worldlings merely made of voice censure the powers above them
come away jove calls thee hence and his will brooks no stay
o stay i have but one poor thought to clothe in airy garments and then faith i go
henceforth thou treacherous and murdering spring be ever call'd the and with thy water let this curse remain as an inseparate plague that who but taste a drop thereof may with the instant touch grow dotingly enamour'd on themselves
now hermes i have finish'd
then thy speech must here forsake thee echo and thy voice as it was wont rebound but the last words
now cupid i am for you and your mirth to make me light before i leave the earth
dear spark of beauty make not so fast away away
stay let me observe this portent yet
i am neither your minotaur nor your centaur nor your satyr nor your hyaena nor your babion but your mere traveller believe me
i guess'd it should be some travelling motion pursued echo so
know you from whom you fly
this is somewhat above strange a nymph of her feature and lineament to be so preposterously rude
well i will but cool myself at yon spring and follow her
nay then i am familiar with the issue i will leave you too
i am a rhinoceros if i had thought a creature of her symmetry would have dared so improportionable and abrupt a digression
liberal and divine fount suffer my profane hand to take of thy bounties
by the purity of my taste here is most ambrosiac water i will sup of it again
by thy favour sweet fount
see the water a more running subtile and humorous nymph than she permits me to touch and handle her
what should i infer
if my behaviours had been of a cheap or customary garb my accent or phrase vulgar my garments trite my countenance illiterate or unpractised in the encounter of a beautiful and brave attired piece then i might with some change of colour have suspected my faculties but knowing myself an essence so sublimated and refined by travel of so studied and well exercised a gesture so alone in fashion able to render the face of any statesman living and to speak the mere extraction of language one that hath now made the sixth return upon venture and was your first that ever enrich'd his country with the true laws of the duello whose optics have drunk the spirit of beauty in some eight score and eighteen prince's courts where i have resided and been there fortunate in the amours of three hundred and forty and five ladies all nobly if not princely descended whose names i have in catalogue to conclude in all so happy as even admiration herself doth seem to fasten her kisses upon me certes i do neither see nor feel nor taste nor savour the least steam or fume of a reason that should invite this foolish fastidious nymph so peevishly to abandon me
well let the memory of her fleet into air my thoughts and i am for this other element water
what the well dieted amorphus become a water drinker
i see he means not to write verses then
because nulla placere diu nec vivere carmina possunt quae scribuntur aquae potoribus
what say you to your helicon
o the muses' well
sir your muses have no such water i assure you your nectar or the juice of your nepenthe is nothing to it 'tis above your metheglin believe it
metheglin what's that sir
may i be so audacious to demand
a kind of greek wine i have met with sir in my travels it is the same that demosthenes usually drunk in the composure of all his exquisite and mellifluous orations
that's to be argued amorphus if we may credit lucian who in his "encomio demosthenis" affirms he never drunk but water in any of his compositions
lucian is absurd he knew nothing i will believe mine own travels before all the lucians of europe
he doth feed you with fittons figments and leasings
indeed i think next a traveller he does prettily well
i assure you it was wine i have tasted it and from the hand of an italian antiquary who derives it authentically from the duke of ferrara's bottles
how name you the gentleman you are in rank there with sir
'tis asotus son to the late deceased philargyrus the citizen
was his father of any eminent place or means
he was to have been praetor next year
a pretty formal young gallant in good sooth pity he is not more genteelly propagated
hark you crites you may say to him what i am if you please though i affect not popularity yet i would loth to stand out to any whom you shall vouchsafe to call friend
sir i fear i may do wrong to your sufficiencies in the reporting them by forgetting or misplacing some one yourself can best inform him of yourself sir except you had some catalogue or list of your faculties ready drawn which you would request me to show him for you and him to take notice of
this crites is sour i will think sir
that anything in the likeness of man should suffer these rack'd extremities for the uttering of his sophisticate good parts
crites i have a suit to you but you must not deny me pray you make this gentleman and i friends
why is there any difference between you
no i mean acquaintance to know one another
o now i apprehend you your phrase was without me before
in good faith he's a most excellent rare man i warrant him
'slight they are mutually enamour'd by this time
will you sweet crites
you'll defer it now and forget it
why is it a thing of such present necessity that it requires so violent a dispatch
no but would i might never stir he's a most ravishing man
good crites you shall endear me to you in good faith la
well your longing shall be satisfied sir
and withal you may tell him what my father was and how well he left me and that i am his heir
leave it to me i'll forget none of your dear graces i warrant you
nay i know you can better marshal these affairs than i can o gods
i'd give all the world if i had it for abundance of such acquaintance
what ridiculous circumstance might i devise now to bestow this reciprocal brace of butterflies one upon another
since i trod on this side the alps i was not so frozen in my invention
let me see to accost him with some choice remnant of spanish or italian
that would indifferently express my languages now marry then if he shall fall out to be ignorant it were both hard and harsh
step into some ragioni del stato and so make my induction
that were above him too and out of his element i fear
feign to have seen him in venice or padua
or some face near his in similitude
'tis too pointed and open
no it must be a more quaint and collateral device as stay to frame some encomiastic speech upon this our metropolis or the wise magistrates thereof in which politic number 'tis odds but his father fill'd up a room
descend into a particular admiration of their justice for the due measuring of coals burning of cans and such like
as also their religion in pulling down a superstitious cross and advancing a venus or priapus in place of it
or to talk of some hospital whose walls record his father a benefactor
or of so many buckets bestow'd on his parish church in his lifetime with his name at length for want of arms trickt upon them
or to praise the cleanness of the street wherein he dwelt
or the provident painting of his posts against he should have been praetor
or leaving his parent come to some special ornament about himself as his rapier or some other of his accountrements
i have it thanks gracious minerva
would i had but once spoke to him and then he comes to me
'tis a most curious and neatly wrought band this same as i have seen sir
you forgive the humour of mine eye in observing it
his eye waters after it it seems
there needs no such apology i assure you
i am anticipated they'll make a solemn deed of gift of themselves you shall see
your riband too does most gracefully in troth
'tis the most genteel and received wear now sir
believe me sir i speak it not to humour you i have not seen a young gentleman generally put on his clothes with more judgment
o 'tis your pleasure to say so sir
no as i am virtuous being altogether untravell'd it strikes me into wonder
i do purpose to travel sir at spring
i think i shall affect you sir
this last speech of yours hath begun to make you dear to me
i would there were any thing in me sir that might appear worthy the least worthiness of your worth sir
i protest sir i should endeavour to shew it sir with more than common regard sir
o here's rare motley sir
both your desert and your endeavours are plentiful suspect them not but your sweet disposition to travel i assure you hath made you another myself in mine eye and struck me enamour'd on your beauties
i would i were the fairest lady of france for your sake sir
and yet i would travel too
o you should digress from yourself else for believe it your travel is your only thing that rectifies or as the italian says "vi rendi pronto all' attioni" makes you fit for action
i think it be great charge though sir
why 'tis nothing for a gentleman that goes private as yourself or so my intelligence shall quit my charge at all time
good faith this hat hath possest mine eye exceedingly 'tis so pretty and fantastic what
is it a beaver
ay sir i'll assure you 'tis a beaver it cost me eight crowns but this morning
after your french account
and so near his head
a very pretty fashion believe me and a most novel kind of trim your band is conceited too
sir it is all at your service
i beseech you sir if you please to wear it you shall do me a most infinite grace
'slight will he be prais'd out of his clothes
by heaven sir i do not offer it you after the italian manner i would you should conceive so of me
sir i shall fear to appear rude in denying your courtesies especially being invited by so proper a distinction may i pray your name sir
my name is asotus sir
i take your love gentle asotus but let me win you to receive this in exchange
they'll change doublets anon
and from this time esteem yourself in the first rank of those few whom i profess to love
what make you in company of this scholar here
i will bring you known to gallants as anaides of the ordinary hedon the courtier and others whose society shall render you graced and respected this is a trivial fellow too mean too cheap too coarse for you to converse with
'slid this is not worth a crown and mine cost me eight but this morning
i looked when he would repent him he has begun to be sad a good while
sir shall i say to you for that hat
be not so sad be not so sad it is a relic i could not so easily have departed with but as the hieroglyphic of my affection you shall alter it to what form you please it will take any block i have received it varied on record to the three thousandth time and not so few it hath these virtues beside your head shall not ache under it nor your brain leave you without license it will preserve your complexion to eternity for no beam of the sun should you wear it under zona torrida hath power to approach it by two ells
it is proof against thunder and enchantment and was given me by a great man in russia as an especial prized present and constantly affirm'd to be the hat that accompanied the politic ulysses in his tedious and ten years' travels
by jove i will not depart withal whosoever would give me a million
save you sweet bloods
does any of you want a creature or a dependent
beshrew me a fine blunt slave
a page of good timber
it will now be my grace to entertain him first though i cashier him again in private
how art thou call'd
how happily hath fortune furnish'd him with a whetstone
i do entertain you cos conceal your quality till we be private if your parts be worthy of me i will countenance you if not catechise you
gentles shall we go
stay sir i'll but entertain this other fellow and then i have a great humour to taste of this water too but i'll come again alone for that mark the place
what's your name youth
a very fine name crites is it not
yes and a very ancient one sir the beggar
follow me good prosaites let's talk
he will rank even with you ere't be long
if you hold on your course
o vanity how are thy painted beauties doted on by light and empty idiots
how pursued with open and extended appetite
how they do sweat and run themselves from breath raised on their toes to catch thy airy forms still turning giddy till they reel like drunkards that buy the merry madness of one hour with the long irksomeness of following time
o how despised and base a thing is man if he not strive to erect his grovelling thoughts above the strain of flesh
but how more cheap when ev'n his best and understanding part the crown and strength of all his faculties floats like a dead drown'd body on the stream of vulgar humour mixt with common'st dregs
i suffer for their guilt now and my soul like one that looks on ill affected eyes is hurt with mere intention on their follies
why will i view them then my sense might ask me
or is't a rarity or some new object that strains my strict observance to this point
o would it were
therein i could afford my spirit should draw a little near to theirs to gaze on novelties so vice were one
tut she is stale rank foul and were it not that those that woo her greet her with lock'd eyes in spight of all th' impostures paintings drugs which her bawd custom dawbs her cheeks withal she would betray her loath'd and leprous face and fright the enamour'd dotards from themselves but such is the perverseness of our nature that if we once but fancy levity how antic and ridiculous soe'er it suit with us yet will our muffled thought choose rather not to see it than avoid it and if we can but banish our own sense we act our mimic tricks with that free license that lust that pleasure that security as if we practised in a paste board case and no one saw the motion but the motion
well check thy passion lest it grow too loud while fools are pitied they wax fat and proud
why this was most unexpectedly followed my divine delicate mercury by the beard of jove thou art a precious deity
nay cupid leave to speak improperly since we are turn'd cracks let's study to be like cracks practise their language and behaviours and not with a dead imitation act freely carelessly and capriciously as if our veins ran with quicksilver and not utter a phrase but what shall come forth steep'd in the very brine of conceit and sparkle like salt in fire
that's not every one's happiness hermes though you can presume upon the easiness and dexterity of your wit you shall give me leave to be a little jealous of mine and not desperately to hazard it after your capering humour
nay then cupid i think we must have you hood wink'd again for you are grown too provident since your eyes were at liberty
not so mercury i am still blind cupid to thee
and what to the lady nymph you serve
troth page boy and sirrah these are all my titles
then thou hast not altered thy name with thy disguise
o no that had been supererogation you shall never hear your courtier call but by one of these three
faith then both our fortunes are the same
why what parcel of man hast thou lighted on for a master
such a one as before i begin to decipher him i dare not affirm to be any thing less than a courtier
so much he is during this open time of revels and would be longer but that his means are to leave him shortly after
his name is hedon a gallant wholly consecrated to his pleasures
he uses much to my lady's chamber i think
how is she call'd and then i can shew thee
o ay he affects her very particularly indeed
these are his graces
he doth besides me keep a barber and a monkey he has a rich wrought waistcoat to entertain his visitants in with a cap almost suitable
his curtains and bedding are thought to be his own his bathing tub is not suspected
he loves to have a fencer a pedant and a musician seen in his lodging a mornings
and not a poet
fie no himself is a rhymer and that's thought better than a poet
he is not lightly within to his mercer no though he come when he takes physic which is commonly after his play
he beats a tailor very well but a stocking seller admirably and so consequently any one he owes money to that dares not resist him
he never makes general invitement but against the publishing of a new suit marry then you shall have more drawn to his lodging than come to the launching of some three ships especially if he be furnish'd with supplies for the retiring of his old wardrobe from pawn if not he does hire a stock of apparel and some forty or fifty pound in gold for that forenoon to shew
he is thought a very necessary perfume for the presence and for that only cause welcome thither six milliners' shops afford you not the like scent
he courts ladies with how many great horse he hath rid that morning or how oft he hath done the whole or half the pommado in a seven night before and sometime ventures so far upon the virtue of his pomander that he dares tell 'em how many shirts he has sweat at tennis that week but wisely conceals so many dozen of balls he is on the score
here he comes that is all this
are any of the ladies in the presence
give me some gold more
is that thy boy hedon
ay what think'st thou of him
i'd geld him i warrant he has the philosopher's stone
well said my good melancholy devil sirrah i have devised one or two of the prettiest oaths this morning in my bed as ever thou heard'st to protest withal in the presence
prithee let's hear them
soft thou'lt use them afore me
no d mn me then i have more oaths than i know how to utter by this air
faith one is "by the tip of your ear sweet lady
" is it not pretty and genteel
yes for the person 'tis applied to a lady
it should be light and nay the other is better exceeds it much the invention is farther fet too
"by the white valley that lies between the alpine hills of your bosom i protest
" well you travell'd for that hedon
ay in a map where his eyes were but blind guides to his understanding it seems
and then i have a salutation will nick all by this caper hay
you know i call madam philautia my honour and she calls me her ambition
now when i meet her in the presence anon i will come to her and say "sweet honour i have hitherto contented my sense with the lilies of your hand but now i will taste the roses of your lip" and withal kiss her to which she cannot but blushing answer "nay now you are too ambitious
" and then do i reply cannot be too ambitious of honour sweet lady
" will't not be good
o assure your soul
by heaven i think 'twill be excellent and a very politic achievement of a kiss
i have thought upon one for moria of a sudden too if it take
what is't my dear invention
marry i will come to her and she always wears a muff if you be remembered and i will tell her "madam your whole self cannot but be perfectly wise for your hands have wit enough to keep themselves warm
" now before jove admirable
look thy page takes it too
by phoebus my sweet facetious rascal i could eat water gruel with thee a month for this jest my dear rogue
o hercules 'tis your only dish above all your potatoes or oyster pies in the world
i have ruminated upon a most rare wish too and the prophecy to it but i'll have some friend to be the prophet as thus i do wish myself one of my mistress's cioppini
another demands why would he be one of his mistress's cioppini
a third answers because he would make her higher a fourth shall say that will make her proud and a fifth shall conclude then do i prophesy pride will have a fall and he shall give it her
i will be your prophet
gods so it will be most exquisite thou art a fine inventious rogue sirrah
nay and i have posies for rings too and riddles that they dream not of
tut they'll do that when they come to sleep on them time enough but were thy devices never in the presence yet hedon
o no i disdain that
'twere good we went afore then and brought them acquainted with the room where they shall act lest the strangeness of it put them out of countenance when they should come forth
is that a courtier too
troth no he has two essential parts of the courtier pride and ignorance marry the rest come somewhat after the ordinary gallant
'tis impudence itself anaides one that speaks all that comes in his cheeks and will blush no more than a sackbut
he lightly occupies the jester's room at the table and keeps laughter gelaia a wench in page's attire following him in place of a squire whom he now and then tickles with some strange ridiculous stuff utter'd as his land came to him by chance
he will censure or discourse of any thing but as absurdly as you would wish
his fashion is not to take knowledge of him that is beneath him in clothes
he never drinks below the salt
he does naturally admire his wit that wears gold lace or tissue stabs any man that speaks more contemptibly of the scholar than he
he is a great proficient in all the illiberal sciences as cheating drinking swaggering whoring and such like never kneels but to pledge healths nor prays but for a pipe of pudding tobacco
he will blaspheme in his shirt
the oaths which he vomits at one supper would maintain a town of garrison in good swearing a twelvemonth
one other genuine quality he has which crowns all these and that is this to a friend in want he will not depart with the weight of a soldered groat lest the world might censure him prodigal or report him a gull marry to his cockatrice or punquetto half a dozen taffata gowns or satin kirtles in a pair or two of months why they are nothing
i commend him he is one of my clients
you are now within regard of the presence and see the privacy of this room how sweetly it offers itself to our retired intendments
page cast a vigilant and enquiring eye about that we be not rudely surprised by the approach of some ruder stranger
i warrant you sir
i'll tell you when the wolf enters fear nothing
o what a mass of benefit shall we possess in being the invisible spectators of this strange show now to be acted
plant yourself there sir and observe me
you shall now as well be the ocular as the ear witness how clearly i can refel that paradox or rather pseudodox of those which hold the face to be the index of the mind which i assure you is not so in any politic creature for instance i will now give you the particular and distinct face of every your most noted species of persons as your merchant your scholar your soldier your lawyer courtier etc
and each of these so truly as you would swear but that your eye shall see the variation of the lineament it were my most proper and genuine aspect
first for your merchant or city face 'tis thus a dull plodding face still looking in a direct line forward there is no great matter in this face
then have you your student's or academic face which is here an honest simple and methodical face but somewhat more spread then the former
the third is your soldier's face a menacing and astounding face that looks broad and big the grace of his face consisteth much in a beard
the anti face to this is your lawyer's face a contracted subtile and intricate face full of quirks and turnings a labyrinthean face now angularly now circularly every way aspected
next is your statist's face a serious solemn and supercilious face full of formal and square gravity the eye for the most part deeply and artificially shadow'd there is great judgment required in the making of this face
but now to come to your face of faces or courtier's face 'tis of three sorts according to our subdivision of a courtier elementary practic and theoric
your courtier theoric is he that hath arrived to his farthest and doth now know the court rather by speculation than practice and this is his face a fastidious and oblique face that looks as it went with a vice and were screw'd thus
your courtier practic is he that is yet in his path his course his way and hath not touch'd the punctilio or point of his hopes his face is here a most promising open smooth and overflowing face that seems as it would run and pour itself into you somewhat a northerly face
your courtier elementary is one but newly enter'd or as it were in the alphabet or ut re mi fa sol la of courtship
note well this face for it is this you must practise
i'll practise them all if you please sir
ay hereafter you may and it will not be altogether an ungrateful study
for let your soul be assured of this in any rank or profession whatever the more general or major part of opinion goes with the face and simply respects nothing else
therefore if that can be made exactly curiously exquisitely thoroughly it is enough but for the present you shall only apply yourself to this face of the elementary courtier a light revelling and protesting face now blushing now smiling which you may help much with a wanton wagging of your head thus a feather will teach you or with kissing your finger that hath the ruby or playing with some string of your band which is a most quaint kind of melancholy besides or if among ladies laughing loud and crying up your own wit though perhaps borrow'd it is not amiss
where is your page
call for your casting bottle and place your mirror in your hat as i told you so
come look not pale observe me set your face and enter
o for some excellent painter to have taken the copy of all these faces
i premonish you of that in the court boy lacquey or sirrah
master lupus in o 'tis prosaites
sirrah prepare my casting bottle i think i must be enforced to purchase me another page you see how at hand cos waits here
so will he too in time
one that hath newly entertain'd the beggar to follow him but cannot get him to wait near enough
'tis asotus the heir of philargyrus but first i'll give ye the other's character which may make his the clearer
he that is with him is amorphus a traveller one so made out of the mixture of shreds of forms that himself is truly deform'd
he walks most commonly with a clove or pick tooth in his mouth he is the very mint of compliment all his behaviours are printed his face is another volume of essays and his beard is an aristarchus
he speaks all cream skimm'd and more affected than a dozen waiting women
he is his own promoter in every place
the wife of the ordinary gives him his diet to maintain her table in discourse which indeed is a mere tyranny over her other guests for he will usurp all the talk ten constables are not so tedious
he is no great shifter once a year his apparel is ready to revolt
he doth use much to arbitrate quarrels and fights himself exceeding well out at a window
he will lie cheaper than any beggar and louder than most clocks for which he is right properly accommodated to the whetstone his page
the other gallant is his zany and doth most of these tricks after him sweats to imitate him in every thing to a hair except a beard which is not yet extant
he doth learn to make strange sauces to eat anchovies maccaroni bovoli fagioli and caviare because he loves them speaks as he speaks looks walks goes so in clothes and fashion is in all as if he were moulded of him
marry before they met he had other very pretty sufficiencies which yet he retains some light impression of as frequenting a dancing school and grievously torturing strangers with inquisition after his grace in his galliard
he buys a fresh acquaintance at any rate
his eyes and his raiment confer much together as he goes in the street
he treads nicely like the fellow that walks upon ropes especially the first sunday of his silk stockings and when he is most neat and new you shall strip him with commendations
ay but one of another strain cupid this fellow weighs somewhat
a creature of a most perfect and divine temper one in whom the humours and elements are peaceably met without emulation of precedency he is neither too fantastically melancholy too slowly phlegmatic too lightly sanguine or too rashly choleric but in all so composed and ordered as it is clear nature went about some full work she did more than make a man when she made him
his discourse is like his behaviour uncommon but not unpleasing he is prodigal of neither
he strives rather to be that which men call judicious than to be thought so and is so truly learned that he affects not to shew it
he will think and speak his thought both freely but as distant from depraving another man's merit as proclaiming his own
for his valour 'tis such that he dares as little to offer any injury as receive one
in sum he hath a most ingenuous and sweet spirit a sharp and season'd wit a straight judgment and a strong mind
fortune could never break him nor make him less
he counts it his pleasure to despise pleasures and is more delighted with good deeds than goods
it is a competency to him that he can be virtuous
he doth neither covet nor fear he hath too much reason to do either and that commends all things to him
not better than mercury commends him
o cupid 'tis beyond my deity to give him his due praises i could leave my place in heaven to live among mortals so i were sure to be no other than he
'slight i believe he is your minion you seem to be so ravish'd with him
he's one i would not have a wry thought darted against willingly
no but a straight shaft in his bosom i'll promise him if i am cytherea's son
shall we go cupid
stay and see the ladies now they'll come presently
i'll help to paint them
what lay colour upon colour
that affords but an ill blazon
here comes metal to help it the lady argurion
a nymph of a most wandering and giddy disposition humorous as the air she'll run from gallant to gallant as they sit at primero in the presence most strangely and seldom stays with any
she spreads as she goes
to day you shall have her look as clear and fresh as the morning and to morrow as melancholic as midnight
she takes special pleasure in a close obscure lodging and for that cause visits the city so often where she has many secret true concealing favourites
when she comes abroad she's more loose and scattering than dust and will fly from place to place as she were wrapped with a whirlwind
your young student for the most part she affects not only salutes him and away a poet nor a philosopher she is hardly brought to take any notice of no though he be some part of an alchemist
she loves a player well and a lawyer infinitely but your fool above all
she can do much in court for the obtaining of any suit whatsoever no door but flies open to her her presence is above a charm
the worst in her is want of keeping state and too much descending into inferior and base offices she's for any coarse employment you will put upon her as to be your procurer or pander
peace cupid here comes more work for you another character or two
stay sweet philautia i'll but change my fan and go presently
now in very good serious ladies i will have this order revers'd the presence must be better maintain'd from you a quarter past eleven and ne'er a nymph in prospective
beshrew my hand there must be a reform'd discipline
is that your new ruff sweet lady bird
by my troth 'tis most intricately rare
good jove what reverend gentlewoman in years might this be
'tis madam moria guardian of the nymphs one that is not now to be persuaded of her wit she will think herself wise against all the judgments that come
a lady made all of voice and air talks any thing of any thing
she is like one of your ignorant poetasters of the time who when they have got acquainted with a strange word never rest till they have wrung it in though it loosen the whole fabric of their sense
that was pretty and sharply noted cupid
she will tell you philosophy was a fine reveller when she was young and a gallant and that then though she say it she was thought to be the dame dido and helen of the court as also what a sweet dog she had this time four years and how it was called fortune and that if the fates had not cut his thread he had been a dog to have given entertainment to any gallant in this kingdom and unless she had whelp'd it herself she could not have loved a thing better in this world
o i prithee no more i am full of her
yes i must needs tell you she composes a sack posset well and would court a young page sweetly but that her breath is against it
now her breath or something more strong protect me from her
the other the other cupid
o that's my lady and mistress madam philautia
she admires not herself for any one particularity but for all she is fair and she knows it she has a pretty light wit too and she knows it she can dance and she knows that too play at shuttle cock and that too no quality she has but she shall take a very particular knowledge of and most lady like commend it to you
you shall have her at any time read you the history of herself and very subtilely run over another lady's sufficiencies to come to her own
she has a good superficial judgment in painting and would seem to have so in poetry
a most complete lady in the opinion of some three beside herself
faith how liked you my quip to hedon about the garter
exceeding witty and integrate you did so aggravate the jest withal
and did i not dance movingly the last night
out of measure in troth sweet charge
a happy commendation to dance out of measure
save only you wanted the swim in the turn when i was at fourteen nay that's mine own from any nymph in the court i'm sure on't therefore you mistake me in that guardian both the swim and the trip are properly mine every body will affirm it that has any judgment in dancing i assure you
come now philautia i am for you shall we go
ay good phantaste what
have you changed your head tire
yes faith the other was so near the common it had no extraordinary grace besides i had worn it almost a day in good troth
i'll be sworn this is most excellent for the device and rare 'tis after the italian print we look'd on t'other night
'tis so by this fan i cannot abide any thing that savours the poor over worn cut that has any kindred with it i must have variety i this mixing in fashion i hate it worse than to burn juniper in my chamber i protest
and yet we cannot have a new peculiar court tire but these retainers will have it these suburb sunday waiters these courtiers for high days i know not what i should call 'em o ay they do most pitifully imitate but i have a tire a coming i'faith shall in good certain madam it makes you look most heavenly but lay your hand on your heart you never skinn'd a new beauty more prosperously in your life nor more metaphysically look good lady sweet lady look
'tis very clear and well believe me
but if you had seen mine yesterday when 'twas young you would have who's your doctor phantaste
nay that's counsel philautia you shall pardon me yet i'll assure you he's the most dainty sweet absolute rare man of the whole college
his very looks his discourse his behaviour all he does is physic i protest
for heaven's sake his name good dear phantaste
no no no no no no believe me not for a million of heavens i will not make him cheap
fie there is a nymph too of a most curious and elaborate strain light all motion an ubiquitary she is every where phantaste her very name speaks her let her pass
but are these cupid the stars of cynthia's court
do these nymphs attend upon diana
they are in her court mercury but not as stars these never come in the presence of cynthia
the nymphs that make her train are the divine arete time phronesis thauma and others of that high sort
these are privately brought in by moria in this licentious time against her knowledge and like so many meteors will vanish when she appears
come follow me my wags and say as i say there's no riches but in rags hey day hey day you that profess this art come away come away and help to bear a part
hey day hey day etc
what those that were our fellow pages but now so soon preferr'd to be yeomen of the bottles
the mystery the mystery good wags
some diet drink they have the guard of
no sir we are going in quest of a strange fountain lately found out
my master or the great discoverer amorphus
thou hast well entitled him cos for he will discover all he knows
ay and a little more too when the spirit is upon him
o the good travelling gentleman yonder has caused such a drought in the presence with reporting the wonders of this new water that all the ladies and gallants lie languishing upon the rushes like so many pounded cattle in the midst of harvest sighing one to another and gasping as if each of them expected a cock from the fountain to be brought into his mouth and without we return quickly they are all as a youth would say no better then a few trouts cast ashore or a dish of eels in a sand bag
well then you were best dispatch and have a care of them
come cupid thou and i'll go peruse this dry wonder
sir let not this discountenance or disgallant you a whit you must not sink under the first disaster
it is with your young grammatical courtier as with your neophyte player a thing usual to be daunted at the first presence or interview you saw there was hedon and anaides far more practised gallants than yourself who were both out to comfort you
it is no disgrace no more than for your adventurous reveller to fall by some inauspicious chance in his galliard or for some subtile politic to undertake the bastinado that the state might think worthily of him and respect him as a man well beaten to the world
hath your tailor provided the property we spake of at your chamber or no
i think he has
nay i entreat you be not so flat and melancholic
erect your mind you shall redeem this with the courtship i will teach you against the afternoon
where eat you to day
where you please sir any where come let us go and taste some light dinner a dish of sliced caviare or so and after you shall practise an hour at your lodging some few forms that i have recall'd
if you had but so far gathered your spirits to you as to have taken up a rush when you were out and wagg'd it thus or cleansed your teeth with it or but turn'd aside and feign'd some business to whisper with your page till you had recovered yourself or but found some slight stain in your stocking or any other pretty invention so it had been sudden you might have come off with a most clear and courtly grace
a poison of all
i think i was forespoke no i must tell you you are not audacious enough you must frequent ordinaries a month more to initiate yourself in which time it will not be amiss if in private you keep good your acquaintance with crites or some other of his poor coat visit his lodging secretly and often become an earnest suitor to hear some of his labours
sir i could never get him to read a line to me
you must then wisely mix yourself in rank with such as you know can and as your ears do meet with a new phrase or an acute jest take it in a quick nimble memory will lift it away and at your next public meal it is your own
but i shall never utter it perfectly sir
no matter let it come lame
in ordinary talk you shall play it away as you do your light crowns at primero it will pass
i shall attempt sir
it is your shifting age for wit and i assure you men must be prudent
after this you may to court and there fall in first with the waiting woman then with the lady
put case they do retain you there as a fit property to hire coaches some pair of months or so or to read them asleep in afternoons upon some pretty pamphlet to breathe you why it shall in time embolden you to some farther achievement in the interim you may fashion yourself to be careless and impudent
how if they would have me to make verses
i heard hedon spoke to for some
why you must prove the aptitude of your genius if you find none you must hearken out a vein and buy provided you pay for the silence as for the work then you may securely call it your own
yes and i'll give out my acquaintance with all the best writers to countenance me the more
rather seem not to know them it is your best
ay be wise that you never so much as mention the name of one nor remember it mentioned but if they be offer'd to you in discourse shake your light head make between a sad and a smiling face pity some rail at all and commend yourself 'tis your only safe and unsuspected course
come you shall look back upon the court again to day and be restored to your colours i do now partly aim at the cause of your repulse which was ominous indeed for as you enter at the door there is opposed to you the frame of a wolf in the hangings which surprising your eye suddenly gave a false alarm to the heart and that was it called your blood out of your face and so routed the whole rank of your spirits i beseech you labour to forget it
and remember as i inculcated to you before for your comfort hedon and anaides
heart was there ever so prosperous an invention thus unluckily perverted and spoiled by a whoreson book worm a candle waster
nay be not impatient hedon
'slight i would fain know his name
hang him poor grogan rascal
prithee think not of him i'll send for him to my lodging and have him blanketed when thou wilt man
ods so i would thou couldst
look here he comes
a laugh at him laugh at him ha ha ha
he smells all lamp oil with studying by candle light
how confidently he went by us and carelessly
never moved nor stirred at any thing
did you observe him
ay a pox on him let him go dormouse he is in a dream now
he has no other time to sleep but thus when he walks abroad to take the air
'sprecious this afflicts me more than all the rest that we should so particularly direct our hate and contempt against him and he to carry it thus without wound or passion
'slid my dear envy if thou but say'st the word now i'll undo him eternally for thee
marry half a score of us get him in one night and make him pawn his wit for a supper
away thou hast such unseasonable jests
by this heaven i wonder at nothing more than our gentlemen ushers that will suffer a piece of serge or perpetuana to come into the presence methinks they should out of their experience better distinguish the silken disposition of courtiers than to let such terrible coarse rags mix with us able to fret any smooth or gentle society to the threads with their rubbing devices
unless 'twere lent ember weeks or fasting days when the place is most penuriously empty of all other good outsides
d n me if i should adventure on his company once more without a suit of buff to defend my wit
he does nothing but stab the slave
how mischievously he cross'd thy device of the prophecy there
and moria she comes without her muff too and there my invention was lost
well i am resolved what i'll do
what my good spiritous spark
marry speak all the venom i can of him and poison his reputation in every place where i come
'fore god most courtly
and if i chance to be present where any question is made of his sufficiencies or of any thing he hath done private or public i'll censure it slightly and ridiculously
at any hand beware of that so thou may'st draw thine own judgment in suspect
no i'll instruct thee what thou shalt do and by a safer means approve any thing thou hearest of his to the received opinion of it but if it be extraordinary give it from him to some other whom thou more particularly affect'st that's the way to plague him and he shall never come to defend himself
'slud i'll give out all he does is dictated from other men and swear it too if thou'lt have me and that i know the time and place where he stole it though my soul be guilty of no such thing and that i think out of my heart he hates such barren shifts yet to do thee a pleasure and him a disgrace i'll damn myself or do any thing
gramercy my dear devil we'll put it seriously in practice i'faith
do good detraction do and i the while shall shake thy spight off with a careless smile
what lean idle slights their thoughts suggest to flatter their starv'd hopes
as if i knew not how to entertain these straw devices but of force must yield to the weak stroke of their calumnious tongues
what should i care what every dor doth buz in credulous ears
it is a crown to me that the best judgments can report me wrong'd them liars and their slanders impudent
perhaps upon the rumour of their speeches some grieved friend will whisper to me crites men speak ill of thee
so they be ill men if they spake worse 'twere better for of such to be dispraised is the most perfect praise
what can his censure hurt me whom the world hath censured vile before me
if good chrestus euthus or phronimus had spoke the words they would have moved me and i should have call'd my thoughts and actions to a strict account upon the hearing but when i remember 'tis hedon and anaides alas then i think but what they are and am not stirr'd
the one a light voluptuous reveller the other a strange arrogating puff both impudent and ignorant enough that talk as they are wont not as i merit traduce by custom as most dogs do bark do nothing out of judgment but disease speak ill because they never could speak well
and who'd be angry with this race of creatures
what wise physician have we ever seen moved with a frantic man
the same affects that he doth bear to his sick patient should a right mind carry to such as these and i do count it a most rare revenge that i can thus with such a sweet neglect pluck from them all the pleasure of their malice for that's the mark of all their enginous drifts to wound my patience howso'er they seem to aim at other objects which if miss'd their envy's like an arrow shot upright that in the fall endangers their own heads
where have you drawn forth the day you have not visited your jealous friends
where i have seen most honour'd arete the strangest pageant fashion'd like a court at least i dreamt i saw it so diffused so painted pied and full of rainbow strains as never yet either by time or place was made the food to my distasted sense nor can my weak imperfect memory now render half the forms unto my tongue that were convolved within this thrifty room
here stalks me by a proud and spangled sir that looks three handfuls higher then his foretop savours himself alone is only kind and loving to himself one that will speak more dark and doubtful than six oracles
salutes a friend as if he had a stitch is his own chronicle and scarce can eat for regist'ring himself is waited on by mimics jesters panders parasites and other such like prodigies of men
he past appears some mincing marmoset made all of clothes and face his limbs so set as if they had some voluntary act without man's motion and must move just so in spight of their creation one that weighs his breath between his teeth and dares not smile beyond a point for fear t'unstarch his look hath travell'd to make legs and seen the cringe of several courts and courtiers knows the time of giving titles and of taking walls hath read court common places made them his studied the grammar of state and all the rules each formal usher in that politic school can teach a man
a third comes giving nods to his repenting creditors protests to weeping suitors takes the coming gold of insolent and base ambition that hourly rubs his dry and itchy palms which griped like burning coals he hurls away into the laps of bawds and buffoons' mouths
with him there meets some subtle proteus one can change and vary with all forms he sees be any thing but honest serves the time hovers betwixt two factions and explores the drifts of both which with cross face he bears to the divided heads and is received with mutual grace of either one that dares do deeds worthy the hurdle or the wheel to be thought somebody and is in sooth such as the satirist points truly forth that only to his crimes owes all his worth
you tell us wonders crites
there stands a neophite glazing of his face pruning his clothes perfuming of his hair against his idol enters and repeats like an unperfect prologue at third music his part of speeches and confederate jests in passion to himself
another swears his scene of courtship over bids believe him twenty times ere they will anon doth seem as he would kiss away his hand in kindness then walks off melancholic and stands wreath'd as he were pinn'd up to the arras thus
a third is most in action swims and frisks plays with his mistress's paps salutes her pumps adores her hems her skirts her knots her curls will spend his patrimony for a garter or the least feather in her bounteous fan
a fourth he only comes in for a mute divides the act with a dumb show and exit
then must the ladies laugh straight comes their scene a sixth times worse confusion then the rest
where you shall hear one talk of this man's eye another of his lip a third his nose a fourth commend his leg a fifth his foot a sixth his hand and every one a limb that you would think the poor distorted gallant must there expire
then fall they in discourse of tires and fashions how they must take place where they may kiss and whom when to sit down and with what grace to rise if they salute what court'sy they must use such cobweb stuff as would enforce the common'st sense abhor th' arachnean workers
this knot of spiders will be soon dissolved and all their webs swept out of cynthia's court when once her glorious deity appears and but presents itself in her full light 'till when go in and spend your hours with us your honour'd friends
time and phronesis in contemplation of our goddess' name
think on some sweet and choice invention now worthy her serious and illustrious eyes that from the merit of it we may take desired occasion to prefer your worth and make your service known to cynthia
it is the pride of arete to grace her studious lovers and in scorn of time envy and ignorance to lift their state above a vulgar height
true happiness consists not in the multitude of friends but in their worth and choice
nor would i have virtue a popular regard pursue let them be good that love me though but few
i kiss thy hands divinest arete and vow myself to thee and cynthia
a little more forward so sir
now go in discloak yourself and come forth
tailor bestow thy absence upon us and be not prodigal of this secret but to a dear customer
'tis well enter'd sir
stay you come on too fast your pace is too impetuous
imagine this to be the palace of your pleasure or place where your lady is pleased to be seen
first you present yourself thus and spying her you fall off and walk some two turns in which time it is to be supposed your passion hath sufficiently whited your face then stifling a sigh or two and closing your lips with a trembling boldness and bold terror you advance yourself forward
prove thus much i pray you
yes sir pray jove i can light on it
here i come in you say and present myself
and then i spy her and walk off
now sir i stifle and advance forward
yes sir trembling i shall do it better when i come to it
and what must i speak now
marry you shall say "dear beauty" or "sweet honour" or by what other title you please to remember her "methinks you are melancholy"
this is if she be alone now and discompanied
well sir i'll enter again her title shall be "my dear lindabrides"
ay sir the emperor alicandroe's daughter and the prince meridian's sister in "the knight of the sun" she should have been married to him but that the princess claridiana o you betray your reading
nay sir i have read history i am a little humanitian
interrupt me not good sir
"my dear lindabrides my dear lindabrides my dear lindabrides methinks you are melancholy"
ay and take her by the rosy finger'd hand
must i so "my dear lindabrides methinks you are melancholy"
"all variety of divine pleasures choice sports sweet music rich fare brave attire soft beds and silken thoughts attend this dear beauty
" believe me that's pretty
"all variety of divine pleasures choice sports sweet music rich fare brave attire soft beds and silken thoughts attend this dear beauty
" and then offering to kiss her hand if she shall coily recoil and signify your repulse you are to re enforce yourself with "more than most fair lady let not the rigour of your just disdain thus coarsely censure of your servant's zeal
" and withal protest her to be the only and absolute unparallel'd creature you do adore and admire and respect and reverence in this court corner of the world or kingdom
this is hard by my faith
i'll begin it all again
do so and i will act it for your lady
will you vouchsafe sir
"all variety of divine pleasures choice sports sweet music rich fare brave attire soft beds and silken thoughts attend this dear beauty
" so sir pray you away
"more than most fair lady let not the rigour of your just disdain thus coarsely censure of your servant's zeal i protest you are the only and absolute unapparell'd " unparallel'd
"unparallel'd creature i do adore and admire and respect and reverence in this corner of the world or kingdom
" this is if she abide you
but now put the case she should be passant when you enter as thus you are to frame your gait thereafter and call upon her "lady nymph sweet refuge star of our court
" then if she be guardant here you are to come on and laterally disposing yourself swear by her blushing and well coloured cheek the bright dye of her hair her ivory teeth though they be ebony or some such white and innocent oath to induce you
if regardant then maintain your station brisk and irpe show the supple motion of your pliant body but in chief of your knee and hand which cannot but arride her proud humour exceedingly
i conceive you sir
i shall perform all these things in good time i doubt not they do so hit me
well sir i am your lady make use of any of these beginnings or some other out of your own invention and prove how you can hold up and follow it
" no you affect that lindabrides too much and let me tell you it is not so courtly
your pedant should provide you some parcels of french or some pretty commodity of italian to commence with if you would be exotic and exquisite
yes sir he was at my lodging t'other morning i gave him a doublet
double your benevolence and give him the hose too clothe you his body he will help to apparel your mind
but now see what your proper genius can perform alone without adjection of any other minerva
i comprehend you sir
i do stand you sir fall back to your first place
good passing well very properly pursued
"beautiful ambiguous and sufficient lady what
are you all alone
" "we would be sir if you would leave us
" am at your beauty's appointment bright angel but " "what but
" "no harm more than most fair feature
" that touch relish'd well
"but i protest " "and why should you protest
" "for good will dear esteem'd madam and i hope your ladyship will so conceive of it and will in time return from your disdain and rue the suff'rance of our friendly pain
" o that piece was excellent
if you could pick out more of these play particles and as occasion shall salute you embroider or damask your discourse with them persuade your soul it would most judiciously commend you
come this was a well discharged and auspicious bout
"lady i cannot ruffle it in red and yellow
" "why if you can revel it in white sir 'tis sufficient
" "say you so sweet lady
lan tede de de de dant dant dant dante
no in good faith madam whosever told your ladyship so abused you but i would be glad to meet your ladyship in a measure
belike you measure me by yourself then
" "would i might fair feature
" "and what were you the better if you might
" "the better it please you to ask fair lady
" why this was ravishing and most acutely continued
well spend not your humour too much you have now competently exercised your conceit this once or twice a day will render you an accomplish'd elaborate and well levell'd gallant
convey in your courting stock we will in the heat of this go visit the nymphs' chamber
i would this water would arrive once our travelling friend so commended to us
so would i for he has left all us in travail with expectation of it
pray jove i never rise from this couch if ever i thirsted more for a thing in my whole time of being a courtier
nor i i'll be sworn the very mention of it sets my lips in a worse heat than if he had sprinkled them with mercury
reach me the glass sirrah
they do not peel sweet charge do they
yes a little guardian
o 'tis an eminent good sign
ever when my lips do so i am sure to have some delicious good drink or other approaching
marry and this may be good for us ladies for it seems 'tis far fet by their stay
my palate for yours dear honour it shall prove most elegant i warrant you
o i do fancy this gear that's long a coming with an unmeasurable strain
pray thee sit down philautia that rebatu becomes thee singularly
is it not quaint
methinks thy servant hedon is nothing so obsequious to thee as he was wont to be i know not how he is grown out of his garb a late he's warp'd
in trueness and so methinks too he is much converted
tut let him be what he will 'tis an animal i dream not of
this tire methinks makes me look very ingeniously quick and spirited i should be some laura or some delia methinks
as i am wise fair honours that title she gave him to be her ambition spoil'd him before he was the most propitious and observant young novice no no you are the whole heaven awry guardian 'tis the swaggering coach horse anaides draws with him there has been the diverter of him
for cupid's sake speak no more of him would i might never dare to look in a mirror again if i respect ever a marmoset of 'em all otherwise than i would a feather or my shuttle cock to make sport with now and then
come sit down troth and you be good beauties let's run over them all now which is the properest man amongst them
i say the traveller amorphus
o fie on him he looks like a venetian trumpeter in the battle of lepanto in the gallery yonder and speaks to the tune of a country lady that comes ever in the rearward or train of a fashion
i should have judgment in a feature sweet beauties
a body would think so at these years
and i prefer another now far before him a million at least
who might that be guardian
marry fair charge anaides
you talk'd of a tune philautia there's one speaks in a key like the opening of some justice's gate or a postboy's horn as if his voice feared an arrest for some ill words it should give and were loth to come forth
ay and he has a very imperfect face
like a sea monster that were to ravish andromeda from the rock
his hands too great too by at least a straw's breadth
nay he has a worse fault than that too
that were a fault in a lady rather than him no they say he puts off the calves of his legs with his stockings every night
turn to another of the pictures for love's sake
whom does she commend afore the rest
i hope i have instructed her sufficiently for an answer
troth i made the motion to her ladyship for one to day i'the presence but it appear'd she was otherways furnished before she would none
who was that argurion
marry the poor plain gentleman in the black there
ay ay he a fellow that nobody so much as look'd upon or regarded and she would have had me done him particular grace
that was a true trick of yourself moria to persuade argurion to affect the scholar
tut but she shall be no chooser for me
in good faith i like the citizen's son there asotus methinks none of them all come near him
hedon's a pretty slight courtier and he wears his clothes well and sometimes in fashion marry his face is but indifferent and he has no such excellent body
no the other is a most delicate youth a sweet face a straight body a well proportion'd leg and foot a white hand a tender voice
o you should have let her alone she was bestowing a copy of him upon us
such a nose were enough to make me love a man now
and then his several colours he wears wherein he flourisheth changeably every day
o but his short hair and his narrow eyes
why she doats more palpably upon him than ever his father did upon her
believe me the young gentleman deserves it
if she could doat more 'twere not amiss
he is an exceeding proper youth and would have made a most neat barber surgeon if he had been put to it in time
methinks he looks like a tailor already
ay that had sayed on one of his customer's suits
his face is like a squeezed orange or well ladies jest on the best of you both would be glad of such a servant
ay i'll be sworn would they though he be a little shame faced
your shame faced servant is your only gull
go to beauties make much of time and place and occasion and opportunity and favourites and things that belong to them for i'll ensure you they will all relinquish they cannot endure above another year i know it out of future experience and therefore take exhibition and warning i was once a reveller myself and though i speak it as mine own trumpet i was then esteem'd the very march pane of the court i warrant you
and all the gallants came about you like flies did they not
go to they did somewhat that's no matter now
nay good moria be not angry
put case that we four now had the grant from juno to wish ourselves into what happy estate we could what would you wish to be moria
who let me see now
i would wish to be a wise woman and know all the secrets of court city and country
i would know what were done behind the arras what upon the stairs what in the garden what in the nymphs' chamber what by barge and what by coach
i would tell you which courtier were scabbed and which not which lady had her own face to lie with her a nights and which not who put off their teeth with their clothes in court who their hair who their complexion and in which box they put it
there should not a nymph or a widow be got with child in the verge but i would guess within one or two who was the right father and in what month it was gotten with what words and which way
i would tell you which madam loved a monsieur which a player which a page who slept with her husband who with her friend who with her gentleman usher who with her horse keeper who with her monkey and who with all yes and who jigg'd the cock too
fie you'd tell all moria
if i should wish now it should be to have your tongue out
but what says philautia
who should she be
troth the very same i am
only i would wish myself a little more command and sovereignty that all the court were subject to my absolute beck and all things in it depending on my look as if there were no other heaven but in my smile nor other hell but in my frown that i might send for any man i list and have his head cut off when i have done with him or made an eunuch if he denied me and if i saw a better face than mine own i might have my doctor to poison it
what would you wish phantaste
faith i cannot readily tell you what but methinks i should wish myself all manner of creatures
now i would be an empress and by and by a duchess then a great lady of state then one of your miscellany madams then a waiting woman then your citizen's wife then a coarse country gentlewoman then a dairy maid then a shepherd's lass then an empress again or the queen of fairies and thus i would prove the vicissitudes and whirl of pleasures about and again
as i were a shepherdess i would be piped and sung to as a dairy wench i would dance at maypoles and make syllabubs as a country gentlewoman keep a good house and come up to term to see motions as a citizen's wife to be troubled with a jealous husband and put to my shifts others' miseries should be my pleasures
as a waiting woman i would taste my lady's delights to her as a miscellany madam invent new tires and go visit courtiers as a great lady lie a bed and have courtiers visit me as a duchess i would keep my state and as an empress i would do any thing
and in all these shapes i would ever be follow'd with the affections of all that see me
marry i myself would affect none or if i did it should not be heartily but so as i might save myself in them still and take pride in tormenting the poor wretches
or now i think on't i would for one year wish myself one woman but the richest fairest and delicatest in a kingdom the very centre of wealth and beauty wherein all lines of love should meet and in that person i would prove all manner of suitors of all humours and of all complexions and never have any two of a sort
i would see how love by the power of his object could work inwardly alike in a choleric man and a sanguine in a melancholic and a phlegmatic in a fool and a wise man in a clown and a courtier in a valiant man and a coward and how he could vary outward by letting this gallant express himself in dumb gaze another with sighing and rubbing his fingers a third with play ends and pitiful verses a fourth with stabbing himself and drinking healths or writing languishing letters in his blood a fifth in colour'd ribands and good clothes with this lord to smile and that lord to court and the t'other lord to dote and one lord to hang himself
and then i to have a book made of all this which i would call the "book of humours" and every night read a little piece ere i slept and laugh at it
save you sweet and clear beauties
by the spirit that moves in me you are all most pleasingly bestow'd ladies
only i can take it for no good omen to find mine honour so dejected
you need not fear sir i did of purpose humble myself against your coming to decline the pride of my ambition
fair honour ambition dares not stoop but if it be your sweet pleasure i shall lose that title i will as i am hedon apply myself to your bounties
that were the next way to dis title myself of honour
o no rather be still ambitious i pray you
i will be any thing that you please whilst it pleaseth you to be yourself lady
sweet phantaste dear moria most beautiful argurion farewell hedon
anaides stay whither go you
'slight what should i do here
an you engross them all for your own use 'tis time for me to seek out
away mischief this is one of your extravagant jests now because i began to salute them by their names
faith you might have spared us madam prudence the guardian there though you had more covetously aim'd at the rest
'sheart take them all man what speak you to me of aiming or covetous
ay say you so
nay then have at them ladies here's one hath distinguish'd you by your names already it shall only become me to ask how you do
ods so was this the design you travail'd with
who answers the brazen head
it spoke to somebody
lady wisdom do you interpret for these puppets
in truth and sadness honours you are in great offence for this
go to the gentleman i'll undertake with him is a man of fair living and able to maintain a lady in her two coaches a day besides pages monkeys and paraquettoes with such attendants as she shall think meet for her turn and therefore there is more respect requirable howso'er you seem to connive
hark you sir let me discourse a syllable with you
i am to say to you these ladies are not of that close and open behaviour as haply you may suspend their carriage is well known to be such as it should be both gentle and extraordinary
o here comes the other pair
that was your father's love the nymph argurion
i would have you direct all your courtship thither if you could but endear yourself to her affection you were eternally engallanted
pray phoebus i prove favoursome in her fair eyes
all divine mixture and increase of beauty to this bright bevy of ladies and to the male courtiers compliment and courtesy
in the behalf of the males i gratify you amorphus
and i of the females
i do vail to both your thanks and kiss them but primarily to yours most ingenious acute and polite lady
ods my life how he does all to bequalify her
"ingenious acute" and "polite
" as if there was not others in place as ingenious acute and polite as she
yes but you must know lady he cannot speak out of a dictionary method
sit down sweet amorphus
when will this water come think you
it cannot now be long fair lady
how most ambiguous beauty
that i will by this handkerchief
'slid he draws his oaths out of his pocket
but will you be constant
i will not say for constantness but by this purse which i would be loth to swear by unless it were embroidered i protest more than most fair lady you are the only absolute and unparallel'd creature i do adore and admire and respect and reverence in this court corner of the world or kingdom
methinks you are melancholy
does your heart speak all this
o he is groping for another oath
now by this watch i marle how forward the day is i do unfeignedly avow myself 'slight 'tis deeper than i took it past five yours entirely addicted madam
i require no more dearest asotus henceforth let me call you mine and in remembrance of me vouchsafe to wear this chain and this diamond
o lord sweet lady
there are new oaths for him
doth hermes taste no alteration in all this
yes thou hast strook argurion enamour'd on asotus methinks
alas no i am nobody i i can do nothing in this disguise
but thou hast not wounded any of the rest cupid
not yet it is enough that i have begun so prosperously
nay these are nothing to the gems i will hourly bestow upon thee be but faithful and kind to me and i will lade thee with my richest bounties behold here my bracelets from mine arms
not so good lady by this diamond
take 'em wear 'em my jewels chain of pearl pendants all i have
nay then by this pearl you make me a wanton
shall not she answer for this to maintain him thus in swearing
o no there is a way to wean him from this the gentleman may be reclaim'd
ay if you had the airing of his apparel coz i think
'twere pity an i should be living else believe me
save you sir save you sweet lady save you monsieur anaides save you dear madam
dost thou know him that saluted thee hedon
no some idle fungoso that hath got above the cupboard since yesterday
'slud i never saw him till this morning and he salutes me as familiarly as if we had known together since the deluge or the first year of troy action
a most right handed and auspicious encounter
confine yourself to your fortunes
for sport's sake let's have some riddles or purposes ho
no faith your prophecies are best the t'other are stale
we cannot all sit in at them we shall make a confusion
no what call'd you that we had in the forenoon
substantives and adjectives is it not hedon
i have thought speak your adjectives sirs
but do not you change then
what must i do sir
give forth your adjective with the rest as prosperous good fair sweet well anything that hath not been spoken
yes sir well spoken shall be mine
what have you all done
then the substantive is breeches
why "odoriferous" breeches guardian
odoriferous because odoriferous that which contains most variety of savour and smell we say is most odoriferous now breeches i presume are incident to that variety and therefore odoriferous breeches
well we must take it howsoever
marry that is when they are not content to be generally noted in court but will press forth on common stages and brokers' stalls to the public view of the world
why "humble" breeches argurion
because they use to be sat upon besides if you tie them not up their property is to fall down about your heels
she has worn the breeches it seems which have done so
but why "white liver'd
are not their linings white
besides when they come in swaggering company and will pocket up any thing may they not properly be said to be white liver'd
o yes we must not deny it
and why "barbarous" hedon
because commonly when you have worn your breeches sufficiently you give them to your barber
that's good but how "pythagorical
" ay amorphus why pythagorical breeches
o most kindly of all 'tis a conceit of that fortune i am bold to hug my brain for
how is it exquisite amorphus
o i am rapt with it 'tis so fit so proper so happy nay do not rack us thus
i never truly relish'd myself before
give me your ears
breeches pythagorical by reason of their transmigration into several shapes
most rare in sweet troth
marry this young gentleman for his well spoken ay why "well spoken" breeches
marry well spoken because whatsoever they speak is well taken and whatsoever is well taken is well spoken
not so ladies neither
but why breeches now
breeches "quasi" bear riches when a gallant bears all his riches in his breeches
'nay we have another sport afore this of a thing done and who did it etc
ay good phantaste let's have that distribute the places
why i imagine a thing done hedon thinks who did it moria with what it was done anaides where it was done argurion when it was done amorphus for what cause was it done you philautia what followed upon the doing of it and this gentleman who would have done it better
is it conceived about
then speak you sir
"who would have done it better
does it begin at me
yes sir this play is called the crab it goes backward
may i not name myself
if you please sir and dare abide the venture of it
then i would have done it better whatever it is
no doubt on't sir a good confidence
"what followed upon the act" philautia
a few heat drops and a month's mirth
"for what cause" amorphus
for the delight of ladies
why in a pair of pain'd slops
then the thing done was "an oration was made
an oration was made by a traveller with a glyster in a pair of pain'd slops last progress for the delight of ladies a few heat drops and a month's mirth followed
and this silent gentleman would have done it better
this was not so good now
in good faith these unhappy pages would be whipp'd for staying thus
beshrew my hand and my heart else
i do wonder at their protraction
pray venus my whore have not discover'd herself to the rascally boys and that be the cause of their stay
i must suit myself with another page this idle prosaites will never be brought to wait well
sir i have a kinsman i could willingly wish to your service if you will deign to accept of him
and i shall be glad most sweet lady to embrace him where is he
i can fetch him sir but i would be loth to make you turn away your other page
you shall not most sufficient lady i will keep both pray you let's go see him
whither goes my love
i'll return presently i go but to see a page with this lady
as sure as fate 'tis so she has opened all a pox of all cockatrices
d n me if she have play'd loose with me i'll cut her throat within a hair's breadth so it may be heal'd again
what is he jealous of his hermaphrodite
o ay this will be excellent sport
what you are suddenly struck methinks
for love's sake let's have some music till they come ambition reach the lyra i pray you
anything to which my honour shall direct me
come amorphus cheer up phantaste
it shall be my pride fair lady to attempt all that is in my power
but here is an instrument that alone is able to infuse soul into the most melancholic and dull disposed creature upon earth
o let me kiss thy fair knees
beauteous ears attend it
will you have "the kiss" honour
o that joy so soon should waste
or so sweet a bliss as a kiss might not for ever last
so sugar'd so melting so soft so delicious the dew that lies on roses when the morn herself discloses is not so precious
o rather than i would it smother were i to taste such another it should be my wishing that i might die with kissing
i made this ditty and the note to it upon a kiss that my honour gave me how like you it sir
a pretty air in general i like it well but in particular your long die note did arride me most but it was somewhat too long
i can show one almost of the same nature but much before it and not so long in a composition of mine own
i think i have both the note and ditty about me
pray you sir see
yes there is the note and all the parts if i misthink not
i will read the ditty to your beauties here but first i am to make you familiar with the occasion which presents itself thus
upon a time going to take my leave of the emperor and kiss his great hands there being then present the kings of france and arragon the dukes of savoy florence orleans bourbon brunswick the landgrave count palatine all which had severally feasted me besides infinite more of inferior persons as counts and others it was my chance the emperor detained by some exorbitant affair to wait him the fifth part of an hour or much near it
in which time retiring myself into a bay window the beauteous lady annabel niece to the empress and sister to the king of arragon who having never before eyed me but only heard the common report of my virtue learning and travel fell into that extremity of passion for my love that she there immediately swooned physicians were sent for she had to her chamber so to her bed where languishing some few days after many times calling upon me with my name in her lips she expired
as that i must mourningly say is the only fault of my fortune that as it hath ever been my hap to be sued to by all ladies and beauties where i have come so i never yet sojourn'd or rested in that place or part of the world where some high born admirable fair feature died not for my love
o the sweet power of travel
are you guilty of this cupid
no mercury and that his page cos knows if he were here present to be sworn
but how doth this draw on the ditty sir
o she is too quick with him he hath not devised that yet
marry some hour before she departed she bequeath'd to me this glove which golden legacy the emperor himself took care to send after me in six coaches cover'd all with black velvet attended by the state of his empire all which he freely presented me with and i reciprocally out of the same bounty gave to the lords that brought it only reserving the gift of the deceased lady upon which i composed this ode and set it to my most affected instrument the lyra
thou more then most sweet glove unto my more sweet love suffer me to store with kisses this empty lodging that now misses the pure rosy hand that wear thee whiter than the kid that bare thee thou art soft but that was softer cupid's self hath kiss'd it ofter than e'er he did his mother's doves
supposing her the queen of loves that was thy mistress blasphemy blasphemy cupid
i'll revenge it time enough hermes
good amorphus let's hear it sung
i care not to admit that since it pleaseth philautia to request it
nay play it i pray you you do well you do well
how like you it sir
very well in troth
o you are a mere mammothrept in judgment then
why do not observe how excellently the ditty is affected in every place
that i do not marry a word of short quantity to a long note
nor an ascending syllable to a descending tone
besides upon the word "best" there you see how i do enter with an odd minum and drive it through the brief which no intelligent musician i know but will affirm to be very rare extraordinary and pleasing
and yet not fit to lament the death of a lady for all this
tut here be they will swallow anything
pray you let me have a copy of it amorphus
and me too in troth i like it exceedingly
i have denied it to princes nevertheless to you the true female twins of perfection i am won to depart withal
i hope i shall have my honour's copy
you are ambitious in that hedon
what is it hath conjured up this distemperature in the circle of your face
why what have you to do
a pox upon your filthy travelling face
nay dost hear mischief
i say to thee thou art rude debauch'd impudent coarse unpolish'd a frapler and base
heart of my father what a strange alteration has half a year's haunting of ordinaries wrought in this fellow
that came with a tufftaffata jerkin to town but the other day and a pair of pennyless hose and now he is turn'd hercules he wants but a club
sir you with the pencil on your chin i will garter my hose with your guts and that shall be all
'slid what rare fireworks be here
what is the matter hedon
nothing but that he lacks crowns and thinks we'll lend him some to be friends

no in faith but there's my glove for a favour
and soon after the revels i will bestow a garter on you
it is more grace than ever i could have hoped but that it pleaseth your ladyships to extend
i protest it is enough that you but take knowledge of my if your ladyships want embroidered gowns tires of any fashion rebatues jewels or carcanets any thing whatsoever if you vouchsafe to accept and for it they will help you to shoe ties and devices
i cannot utter myself dear beauties but you can conceive sir we will acknowledge your service doubt not henceforth you shall be no more asotus to us but our goldfinch and we your cages

how he prays money to go away from him
amorphus a word with you here's a watch i would bestow upon you pray you make me known to that gallant
that i will sir
monsieur hedon i must entreat you to exchange knowledge with this gentleman
'tis a thing next to the water we expect i thirst after sir
good monsieur hedon i would be glad to be loved of men of your rank and spirit i protest
please you to accept this pair of bracelets sir they are not worth the bestowing o hercules how the gentleman purchases this must needs bring argurion to a consumption

o venus sir your acquaintance shall be sufficient
and if at any time you need my bill or my bond help the lady there

and why i should stay so long
and how is't possible
and withal calls me at his pleasure i know not how many cockatrices and things
in truth and sadness these are no good epitaphs anaides to bestow upon any gentlewoman and i'll ensure you if i had known you would have dealt thus with my daughter she should never have fancied you so deeply as she has done
why do you hear mother moria
nay i pray you sir do not swear
'sblood i have sworn afore now i hope
both you and your daughter mistake me

'sblood this water is the spirit of wine i'll be hang'd else
here's the lady arete madam
what at your bever gallants
will't please your ladyship to drink
'tis of the new fountain water
not i moria i thank you
gallants you are for this night free to your peculiar delights cynthia will have no sports when she is pleased to come forth you shall have knowledge
in the mean time i could wish you did provide for solemn revels and some unlooked for device of wit to entertain her against she should vouchsafe to grace your pastimes with her presence
what say you to a masque
nothing better if the project were new and rare
why i'll send for crites and have his advice be you ready in your endeavours he shall discharge you of the inventive part
but will not your ladyship stay
let her go i pray you good lady sobriety i am glad we are rid of her
what a set face the gentlewoman has as she were still going to a sacrifice
o she is the extraction of a dozen of puritans for a look
of all nymphs i' the court i cannot away with her 'tis the coarsest thing
i wonder how cynthia can affect her so above the rest
here be they are every way as fair as she and a thought fairer i trow
ay and as ingenious and conceited as she
ay and as politic as she for all she sets such a forehead on't
would i were dead if i would change to be cynthia
or or and there's her minion crites why his advice more than amorphus
have i not invention afore him
learning to better that invention above him
and infanted with pleasant travel death what talk you of his learning
he understands no more than a schoolboy i have put him down myself a thousand times by this air and yet i never talk'd with him but twice in my life you never saw his like
i could never get him to argue with me but once and then because i could not construe an author i quoted at first sight he went away and laughed at me
by hercules i scorn him as i do the sodden nymph that was here even now his mistress arete and i love myself for nothing else
i wonder the fellow does not hang himself being thus scorn'd and contemn'd of us that are held the most accomplish'd society of gallants
by yourselves none else
i protest if i had no music in me no courtship that i were not a reveller and could dance or had not those excellent qualities that give a man life and perfection but a mere poor scholar as he is i think i should make some desperate way with myself whereas now would i might never breathe more if i do know that creature in this kingdom with whom i would change
well i must alter all this soon
look you do cupid
the bottles have wrought it seems
o i am sorry the revels are crost
i should have tickled it soon
i did never appear till then
'slid i am the neatliest made gallant i' the company and have the best presence and my dancing well i know what our usher said to me last time i was at the school would i might have led philautia in the measures an it had been the gods' will
i am most worthy i am sure
master i can tell you news the lady kissed me yonder and played with me and says she loved you once as well as she does me but that you cast her off
peace my most esteemed page
what luck is this that our revels are dash'd now was i beginning to glister in the very highway of preferment
an cynthia had but seen me dance a strain or do but one trick i had been kept in court i should never have needed to look towards my friends again
contain yourself you were a fortunate young man if you knew your own good which i have now projected and will presently multiply upon you
beauties and valours your vouchsafed applause to a motion
the humorous cynthia hath for this night withdrawn the light of your delight
'tis true amorphus what may we do to redeem it
redeem that we cannot but to create a new flame is in our power
here is a gentleman my scholar whom for some private reasons me specially moving i am covetous to gratify with title of master in the noble and subtile science of courtship for which grace he shall this night in court and in the long gallery hold his public act by open challenge to all masters of the mystery whatsoever to play at the four choice and principal weapons thereof viz
"the bare accost the better regard the solemn address" and "the perfect close
" what say you
well let us then take our time by the forehead i will instantly have bills drawn and advanced in every angle of the court
sir betray not your too much joy
anaides we must mix this gentleman with you in acquaintance monsieur asotus
i am easily entreated to grace any of your friends amorphus
sir and his friends shall likewise grace you sir
nay i begin to know myself now
o you must continue your bounties
must why i'll give him this ruby on my finger
do you hear sir
i do heartily wish your acquaintance and i partly know myself worthy of it please you sir to accept this poor ruby in a ring sir
the poesy is of my own device "let this blush for me" sir
so it must for me too for i am not asham'd to take it
by my troth master i love you will you love me too for my aunt's sake
i'll wait well you shall see
i'll still be here
would i might never stir but you are a fine man in these clothes master shall i have them when you have done with them
as for that morus thou shalt see more hereafter in the mean time by this air or by this feather i'll do as much for thee as any gallant shall do for his page whatsoever in this court corner of the world or kingdom
i wonder this gentleman should affect to keep a fool methinks he makes sport enough with himself
well prosaites 'twere good you did wait closer
ay i'll look to it 'tis time
the revels would have been most sumptuous to night if they had gone forward
they must needs when all the choicest singularities of the court were up in pantofles ne'er a one of them but was able to make a whole show of itself
sirrah a torch a torch
o what a call is there
i will have a canzonet made with nothing in it but sirrah and the burthen shall be i come
how now cupid how do you like this change
faith the thread of my device is crack'd i may go sleep till the revelling music awake me
and then too cupid without you had prevented the fountain
alas poor god that remembers not self love to be proof against the violence of his quiver
well i have a plot against these prizers for which i must presently find out crites and with his assistance pursue it to a high strain of laughter or mercury hath lost of his metal
v it is resolved on crites you must do it
the grace divinest mercury hath done me in this vouchsafed discovery of himself binds my observance in the utmost term of satisfaction to his godly will though i profess without the affectation of an enforced and form'd austerity i could be willing to enjoy no place with so unequal natures
but for our sake and to inflict just pains on their prodigious follies aid us now no man is presently made bad with ill
and good men like the sea should still maintain their noble taste in midst of all fresh humours that flow about them to corrupt their streams bearing no season much less salt of goodness
it is our purpose crites to correct and punish with our laughter this night's sport which our court dors so heartily intend and by that worthy scorn to make them know how far beneath the dignity of man their serious and most practised actions are
ay but though mercury can warrant out his undertakings and make all things good out of the powers of his divinity th' offence will be return'd with weight on me that am a creature so despised and poor when the whole court shall take itself abused by our ironical confederacy
the better race in court that have the true nobility call'd virtue will apprehend it as a grateful right done to their separate merit and approve the fit rebuke of so ridiculous heads who with their apish customs and forced garbs would bring the name of courtier in contempt did it not live unblemish'd in some few whom equal jove hath loved and phoebus form'd of better metal and in better mould
well since my leader on is mercury i shall not fear to follow
if i fall my proper virtue shall be my relief that follow'd such a cause and such a chief
no more if you love me good master you are incompatible to live withal send me for the ladies
nay but intend me
fear me not i warrant you sir
render not yourself a refractory on the sudden
i can allow well you should repute highly heartily and to the most of your own endowments it gives you forth to the world the more assured but with reservation of an eye to be always turn'd dutifully back upon your teacher
nay good sir leave it to me
trust me with trussing all the points of this action i pray
'slid i hope we shall find wit to perform the science as well as another
i confess you to be of an apted and docible humour
yet there are certain punctilios or as i may more nakedly insinuate them certain intrinsecate strokes and wards to which your activity is not yet amounted as your gentle dor in colours
for supposition your mistress appears here in prize ribanded with green and yellow now it is the part of every obsequious servant to be sure to have daily about him copy and variety of colours to be presently answerable to any hourly or half hourly change in his mistress's revolution i know it sir
give leave i pray you which if your antagonist or player against you shall ignorantly be without and yourself can produce you give him the dor
or if you can possess your opposite that the green your mistress wears is her rejoicing or exultation in his service the yellow suspicion of his truth from her height of affection and that he greenly credulous shall withdraw thus in private and from the abundance of his pocket to displace her jealous conceit steal into his hat the colour whose blueness doth express trueness she being not so nor so affected you give him the dor
do not i know it sir
nay good swell not above your understanding
there is yet a third dor in colours
i know it too i know it
do you know it too
make good your knowledge
why it is no matter for that
do it on pain of the dor
why what is't say you
lo you have given yourself the dor
but i will remonstrate to you the third dor which is not as the two former dors indicative but deliberative as how
your rival is with a dutiful and serious care lying in his bed meditating how to observe his mistress dispatcheth his lacquey to the chamber early to know what her colours are for the day with purpose to apply his wear that day accordingly you lay wait before preoccupy the chamber maid corrupt her to return false colours he follows the fallacy comes out accoutred to his believed instructions your mistress smiles and you give him the dor
why so i told you sir i knew it
it is a strange outrecuidance your humour too much redoundeth
why sir what do you think you know more
i know that a cook may as soon and properly be said to smell well as you to be wise
i know these are most clear and clean strokes
but then you have your passages and imbrocatas in courtship as the bitter bob in wit the reverse in face or wry mouth and these more subtile and secure offenders
i will example unto you your opponent makes entry as you are engaged with your mistress
you seeing him close in her ear with this whisper "here comes your baboon disgrace him" and withal stepping off fall on his bosom and turning to her politely aloud say lady regard this noble gentleman a man rarely parted second to none in this court and then stooping over his shoulder your hand on his breast your mouth on his backside you give him the reverse stroke with this sanna or stork's bill which makes up your wit's bob most bitter
nay for heaven's sake teach me no more
i know all as well 'slid if i did not why was i nominated
why did you choose me
why did the ladies prick out me
i am sure there were other gallants
but me of all the rest
by that light and as i am a courtier would i might never stir but 'tis strange
would to the lord the ladies would come once
signior the gallants and ladies are at hand
are you ready sir
go accomplish your attire cousin morphides assist me to make good the door with your officious tyranny

for the bare accost two wall eyes in a face forced for the better regard a face favourably simpering with a fan waving for the solemn address two lips wagging and never a wise word for the perfect close a wring by the hand with a banquet in a corner
and phoebus save cynthia
" appeareth no man yet to answer the prizer
music give them their summons
the solemnity of this is excellent
well i perceive your name is their terror and keepeth them back
i'faith master let's go no body comes
'victus victa victum victi victae victi let's be retrograde
that were dispunct to the ladies
rather ourself shall be your encounter
take your state up to the wall and lady may we implore you to stand forth as first term or bound to our courtship
'fore heaven 'twill shew rarely
a a pox on't
your vulgar will count this fabulous and impudent now by that candle they'll never conceit it
most fashionably believe it
o he is a well spoken gentleman
for a scholar honour
o 'tis too dutch
he reels too much
a this weapon is done
no we have our two bouts at every weapon expect
where be these gallants and their brave prizer here
bear back keep the door
what are you sir
by your license grand master
who let in that rag there amongst us
put him out an impecunious creature
you must be retrograde
soft sir i am truchman and do flourish before this monsieur or french behaved gentleman here who is drawn hither by report of your chartels advanced in court to prove his fortune with your prizer so he may have fair play shewn him and the liberty to choose his stickler
is he a master
that sir he has to shew here and confirmed under the hands of the most skilful and cunning complimentaries alive please you read sir
a what shall we do
disgrace this fellow in the black stuff whatever you do
why but he comes with the stranger
that's no matter he is our own countryman
ay and he is a scholar besides
you may disgrace him here with authority
well see these first
now shall i be observed by yon scholar till i sweat again i would to jove it were over
sir this is the wight of worth that dares you to the encounter
a gentleman of so pleasing and ridiculous a carriage as even standing carries meat in the mouth you see and i assure you although no bred courtling yet a most particular man of goodly havings well fashion'd 'haviour and of as hardened and excellent a bark as the most naturally qualified amongst them inform'd reform'd and transform'd from his original citycism by this elixir or mere magazine of man
and for your spectators you behold them what they are the most choice particulars in court this tells tales well this provides coaches this repeats jests this presents gifts this holds up the arras this takes down from horse this protests by this light this swears by that candle this delighteth this adoreth yet all but three men
then for your ladies the most proud witty creatures all things apprehending nothing understanding perpetually laughing curious maintainers of fools mercers and minstrels costly to be kept miserably keeping all disdaining but their painter and apothecary 'twixt whom and them there is this reciprock commerce their beauties maintain their painters and their painters their beauties
sir you have plaid the painter yourself and limn'd them to the life
i desire to deserve before them
we must resolve to entertain the monsieur howsoever we neglect him
come let's all go together and salute him
content and not look on the other
well devised and a most punishing disgrace
monsieur we must not so much betray ourselves to discourtship as to suffer you to be longer unsaluted please you to use the state ordain'd for the opponent in which nature without envy we receive you
and commend us to you sir
believe it he is a man of excellent silence
he keeps all his wit for action
this hath discountenanced our scholaris most richly
out of all emphasis
the monsieur sees we regard him not
hold on make it known how bitter a thing it is not to be look'd on in court
'slud will he call him to him yet
does not monsieur perceive our disgrace
he is a fool i see
we have done ourselves wrong to grace him
'slight what an ass was i to embrace him
illustrious and fearful judges turn away turn away
it is the suit of the strange opponent to whom you ought not to turn your tails and whose noses i must follow that he may have the justice before he encounter his respected adversary to see some light stroke of his play commenced with some other
answer not him but the stranger we will not believe him
i will demand him myself
o dreadful disgrace if a man were so foolish to feel it
is it your suit monsieur to see some prelude of my scholar
now sure the monsieur wants language and take upon him to be one of the accomplished
'slight that's a good jest would we could take him with that nullity
"non sapete voi parlar' italiano
" 'sfoot the carp has no tongue
signior in courtship you are to bid your abettors forbear and satisfy the monsieur's request
well i will strike him more silent with admiration and terrify his daring hither
he shall behold my own play with my scholar
lady with the touch of your white hand let me reinstate you
provost begin to me at the "bare accost"
a now for the honour of my discipline
signior amorphus reflect reflect what means he by that mouthed wave
he is in some distaste of your fellow disciple
signior your scholar might have played well still if he could have kept his seat longer i have enough of him now
he is a mere piece of glass i see through him by this time
you come not to give us the scorn monsieur
nor to be frighted with a face signior
i have seen the lions
you must pardon me
i shall be loth to hazard a reputation with one that has not a reputation to lose
meaning your pupil sir
this is that black devil there
you do offer a strange affront monsieur
sir he shall yield you all the honour of a competent adversary if you please to undertake him
i am prest for the encounter
what my master sir
'slight monsieur meddle with me do you hear but do not meddle with my master
peace good squib go out
and stink he bids you
i do accept him
sit you down and observe
he never profest a thing at more charges
i will prosecute what disgrace my hatred can dictate to me
how tender a traveller's spleen is
comparison to men that deserve least is ever most offensive
you are instructed in our chartel and know our weapons
i appear not without their notice sir
but must i lose the prizes master
i will win them for you be patient
lady vouchsafe the tenure of this ensign
who shall be your stickler
i would not wish you a weaker
i provoke you at the bare accost
this is the exalted foretop
o his leg was too much produced
and his hat was carried scurvily
peace let's see the monsieur's accost rare
true it is the french courteau he lacks but to have his nose slit
he does bound too much
a the second bout to conclude this weapon
a good believe it
this is called the solemn band string
foh that cringe was not put home
he makes a face like a stabb'd lucrece
well he would needs take it upon him but would i had done it for all this
he makes me sit still here like a baboon as i am
see the french prepares it richly
ay this is ycleped the serious trifle
'slud 'tis the horse start out o' the brown study
rather the bird eyed stroke sir
your observance is too blunt sir
a judges award the prize
this bout hath been laborious
and yet your critic or your besongno will think these things foppery and easy now
or rather mere lunacy
for would any reasonable creature make these his serious studies and perfections much less only live to these ends
to be the false pleasure of a few the true love of none and the just laughter of all
we must prefer the monsieur we courtiers must be partial
name the prize at the bare accost
a pair of wall eyes in a face forced
amorphus hath lost his eyes
is the palate of your judgment down
gentles i do appeal
yes master to me the judges be fools
tie up your tongue mungrel
sit you still sir
why so i do do not i i pray you
remercie madame and these honourable censors
well to the second weapon the "better regard"
i will encounter you better
what says my good ambition
which take you at this next weapon
i lay a discretion with you on amorphus's head
why i take the french behaved gentleman
'tis done a discretion
a pretty court wager
would any discreet person hazard his wit so
i'll lay a discretion with you anaides
hang 'em i'll not venture a doit of discretion on either of their heads
no he should venture all then
i like none of their plays
this is strange play
'tis too full of uncertain motion
he hobbles too much
'tis call'd your court staggers sir
that same fellow talks so now he has a place
"your good ladyship's affectioned
they speak at this weapon brother
they must do so sister how should it be the better regard else
methinks he did not this respectively enough
why the monsieur but dallies with him
he'll put him to't in earnest
that puff was good indeed
this is desperate play he hits himself o' the shins
an he make this good through he carries it i warrant him
indeed he displays his feet rarely
he does the respective leer damnably well
"the true idolater of your beauties shall never pass their deities unadored i rest your poor knight
" see now the oblique leer or the janus he satisfies all with that aspect most nobly
and most terribly he comes off like your rodomontado
how like you this play anaides
good play but 'tis too rough and boisterous
i will second it with a stroke easier wherein i will prove his language
a this is filthy and grave now
o 'tis cool and wary play
we must not disgrace our own camerade too much
"signora ho tanto obligo per le favore resciuto da lei che veramente desidero con tutto il core a remunerarla in parte e sicurative signora mea cara che io sera sempre pronto a servirla e honorarla
bascio le mane de vo' signoria
" the venetian dop this
the french goes down certain
as buckets are put down into a well or as a school boy truss up your simile jack daw and observe
now the monsieur is moved
the french quirk this sir
heart he will over run her
"madamoyselle je voudroy que pouvoy monstrer mon affection mais je suis tant malhereuse ci froid ci layd ci je ne scay qui de dire excuse moi je suis tout vostre
" a o brave and spirited
he's a right jovialist
no no amorphus's gravity outweighs it
and yet your lady or your feather would outweigh both
what's the prize lady at this better regard
a face favourably simpering and a fan waving
they have done doubtfully
give the favourable face to the signior and the light wave to the monsieur
you become the simper well lady
and the wag better
now to our "solemn address
" please the well graced philautia to relieve the lady sentinel she hath stood long
with all my heart come guardian resign your place
monsieur furnish yourself with what solemnity of ornament you think fit for this third weapon at which you are to shew all the cunning of stroke your devotion can possibly devise
let me alone sir
i'll sufficiently decipher your amorous solemnities
see if i hit not all their practic observance with which they lime twigs to catch their fantastic lady birds
ay but you should do more charitably to do it more openly that they might discover themselves mock'd in these monstrous affections
a lackey where's the tailor
see they have their tailor barber perfumer milliner jeweller feather maker all in common
ay this is pretty
here is a hair too much take it off
where are thy mullets
is this pink of equal proportion to this cut standing off this distance from it
that it is sir
is it so sir
you impudent poltroon you slave you list you shreds you excellent
this was the best yet
why we must use our tailors thus this is our true magnanimity
come go to put on we must bear with you for the times' sake
is the perfume rich in this jerkin
taste smell i assure you sir pure benjamin the only spirited scent that ever awaked a neapolitan nostril
you would wish yourself all nose for the love on't
i frotted a jerkin for a new revenued gentleman yielded me three score crowns but this morning and the same titillation
i savour no sampsuchine in it
i am a nulli fidian if there be not three thirds of a scruple more of sampsuchinum in this confection than ever i put in any
i'll tell you all the ingredients sir
you shall be simple to discover your simples
what reck i to whom i discover
i have it in musk civet amber phoenicobalanus the decoction of turmerick sesana nard spikenard calamus odoratus stacte opobalsamum amomum storax ladanum aspalathum opoponax oenanthe
and what of all these now
what are you the better
tut it is the sorting and the dividing and the mixing and the tempering and the searching and the decocting that makes the fumigation and the suffumigation
well indue me with it
and most worthy a true voluptuary jove
what a coil these musk worms take to purchase another's delight
for themselves who bear the odours have ever the least sense of them
yet i do like better the prodigality of jewels and clothes whereof one passeth to a man's heirs the other at least wears out time
this presently expires and without continual riot in reparation is lost which whoso strives to keep it is one special argument to me that affecting to smell better than other men he doth indeed smell far worse
i know you will say it sits well sir
good faith if it do not sir let your mistress be judge
by heaven if my mistress do not like it i'll make no more conscience to undo thee than to undo an oyster
believe it there's ne'er a mistress in the world can mislike it
no not goodwife tailor your mistress that has only the judgment to heat your pressing tool
but for a court mistress that studies these decorums and knows the proportion of every cut to a hair knows why such a colour is cut upon such a colour and when a satin is cut upon six taffataes will look that we should dive into the depth of the cut give me my scarf
shew some ribands sirrah
have you the feather
have you the jewel
what must i give for the hire on't
you shall give me six crowns sir
by heaven 'twere a good deed to borrow it of thee to shew and never let thee have it again
i hope your worship will not do so sir
by jove sir there be such tricks stirring i can tell you and worthily too
extorting knaves that live by these court decorums and yet what's your jewel worth i pray
a hundred crowns sir
a hundred crowns and six for the loan on't an hour
what's that in the hundred for the year
these impostors would not be hang'd
your thief is not comparable to them by hercules
well put it in and the feather you will have it and you shall and the pox give you good on't
give me my confects my moscadini and place those colours in my hat
these are bolognian ribands i warrant you
in truth sir if they be not right granado silk a pox on you you'll all say so
you give me not a penny sir
come sir perfume my devant "may it ascend like solemn sacrifice into the nostrils of the queen of love
" your french ceremonies are the best
monsieur signior your solemn address is too long the ladies long to have you come on
soft sir our coming on is not so easily prepared
can you help my complexion here
o yes sir i have an excellent mineral fucus for the purpose
the gloves are right sir you shall bury them in a muck hill a draught seven years and take them out and wash them they shall still retain their first scent true spanish
there's ambre in the umbre
your price sweet fig
give me what you will sir the signior pays me two crowns a pair you shall give me your love sir
with a pox to you goodman sassafras
there's an excellent diapasm in a chain too if you like it
stay what are the ingredients to your fucus
nought but sublimate and crude mercury sir well prepared and dulcified with the jaw bones of a sow burnt beaten and searced
i'll have your chain of pomander sirrah what's your price
we'll agree monsieur i'll assure you it was both decocted and dried where no sun came and kept in an onyx ever since it was balled
come invert my mustachio and we have done
hold still i pray you sir
nay the fucus is exorbitant sir
death dost thou burn me harlot
i beseech you sir
your french beat is the most natural beat of the world
o that i had played at this weapon
a peace now they come on the second part
"madam your beauties being so attractive i muse you are left thus alone
" "better be alone sir than ill accompanied
" "nought can be ill lady that can come near your goodness
" "sweet madam on what part of you soever a man casts his eye he meets with perfection you are the lively image of venus throughout all the graces smile in your cheeks your beauty nourishes as well as delights you have a tongue steeped in honey and a breath like a panther your breasts and forehead are whiter than goats' milk or may blossoms a cloud is not so soft as your skin " well strook monsieur
he charges like a frenchman indeed thick and hotly
"your cheeks are cupid's baths wherein he uses to steep himself in milk and nectar he does light all his torches at your eyes and instructs you how to shoot and wound with their beams
yet i love nothing in you more than your innocence you retain so native a simplicity so unblamed a behaviour
methinks with such a love i should find no head nor foot of my pleasure you are the very spirit of a lady
" fair play monsieur you are too hot on the quarry give your competitor audience
"lady how stirring soever the monsieur's tongue is he will lie by your side more dull than your eunuch
" a good stroke that mouth was excellently put over
"you are fair lady " you offer foul signior to close keep your distance for all your bravo rampant here
say you are fair lady let your choice be fit as you are fair
" say ladies do never believe they are fair till some fool begins to doat upon them
" you play too rough gentlemen
"your frenchified fool is your only fool lady i do yield to this honourable monsieur in all civil and humane courtesy
give him the prize give him the prize that mouth again was most courtly hit and rare
i knew i should pass upon him with the bitter bob
o but the reverse was singular
it was most subtile amorphus
if i had done't it should have been better

heart of my blood amorphus what have you done
stuck a disgrace upon us all and at your last weapon
i could have done no more
by heaven it was most unfortunate luck
by that candle it was mere rashness and oversight would any man have ventured to play so open and forsake his ward
d n me if he have not eternally undone himself in court and discountenanced us that were his main countenance by it
forgive it now it was the solecism of my stars
the wring by the hand and the banquet is ours
o here's a lady feels like a wench of the first year you would think her hand did melt in your touch and the bones of her fingers ran out at length when you prest 'em they are so gently delicate
he that had the grace to print a kiss on these lips should taste wine and rose leaves
o she kisses as close as a cockle
let's take them down as deep as our hearts wench till our very souls mix
adieu signior good faith i shall drink to you at supper sir
who awards you the prize
why his proper merit sir you see he has played down your grand garb master here
that's not in your logic to determine sir you are no courtier
this is none of your seven or nine beggarly sciences but a certain mystery above them wherein we that have skill must pronounce and not such fresh men as you are
indeed i must declare myself to you no profest courtling nor to have any excellent stroke at your subtile weapons yet if you please i dare venture a hit with you or your fellow sir dagonet here
heart i shall never have such a fortune to save myself in a fellow again and your two reputations gentlemen as in this

a you shall see me undo the assured swaggerer with a trick instantly i will play all his own play before him court the wench in his garb in his phrase with his face leave him not so much as a look an eye a stalk or an imperfect oath to express himself by after me
when begin you sir
to your cost sir
which is the piece stands forth to be courted
o are you she
"well madam or sweet lady it is so i do love you in some sort do you conceive
and though i am no monsieur nor no signior and do want as they say logic and sophistry and good words to tell you why it is so yet by this hand and by that candle it is so and though i be no book worm nor one that deals by art to give you rhetoric and causes why it should be so or make it good it is so
yet d n me but i know it is so and am assured it is so and i and my sword shall make it appear it is so and give you reason sufficient how it can be no otherwise but so " 'slight anaides you are mocked and so we are all
what suffer yourself to be cozened of your courtship before your face
this is plain confederacy to disgrace us let's be gone and plot some revenge
"when men disgraces share the lesser is the care
" nay stay my dear ambition i can do you over too
you that tell your mistress her beauty is all composed of theft her hair stole from apollo's goldy locks her white and red lilies and roses stolen out of paradise her eyes two stars pluck'd from the sky her nose the gnomon of love's dial that tells you how the clock of your heart goes and for her other parts as you cannot reckon them they are so many so you cannot recount them they are so manifest
yours if his own unfortunate hoyden instead of hedon
a sister come away i cannot endure them longer
go dors and you my madam courting stocks follow your scorned and derided mates tell to your guilty breasts what mere gilt blocks you are and how unworthy human states
now sacred god of wit if you can make those whom our sports tax in these apish graces kiss like the fighting snakes your peaceful rod these times shall canonise you for a god
why crites think you any noble spirit or any worth the title of a man will be incensed to see the enchanted veils of self conceit and servile flattery wrapt in so many folds by time and custom drawn from his wronged and bewitched eyes
who sees not now their shape and nakedness is blinder than the son of earth the mole crown'd with no more humanity nor soul
though they may see it yet the huge estate fancy and form and sensual pride have gotten will make them blush for anger not for shame and turn shewn nakedness to impudence
humour is now the test we try things in all power is just nought that delights is sin
and yet the zeal of every knowing man opprest with hills of tyranny cast on virtue by the light fancies of fools thus transported
cannot but vent the aetna of his fires t'inflame best bosoms with much worthier love than of these outward and effeminate shades that these vain joys in which their wills consume such powers of wit and soul as are of force to raise their beings to eternity may be converted on works fitting men and for the practice of a forced look an antic gesture or a fustian phrase study the native frame of a true heart an inward comeliness of bounty knowledge and spirit that may conform them actually to god's high figures which they have in power which to neglect for a self loving neatness is sacrilege of an unpardon'd greatness
then let the truth of these things strengthen thee in thy exempt and only man like course like it the more the less it is respected though men fail virtue is by gods protected
see here comes arete i'll withdraw myself
crites you must provide straight for a masque 'tis cynthia's pleasure
why 'twere a labour more for hercules better and sooner durst i undertake to make the different seasons of the year the winds or elements to sympathise than their unmeasurable vanity dance truly in a measure
what though all concord's born of contraries so many follies will confusion prove and like a sort of jarring instruments all out of tune because indeed we see there is not that analogy 'twixt discords as between things but merely opposite
there is your error for as hermes' wand charms the disorders of tumultuous ghosts and as the strife of chaos then did cease when better light than nature's did arrive so what could never in itself agree forgetteth the eccentric property and at her sight turns forth with regular whose sceptre guides the flowing ocean and though it did not yet the most of them being either courtiers or not wholly rude respect of majesty the place and presence will keep them within ring especially when they are not presented as themselves but masqued like others for in troth not so to incorporate them could be nothing else than like a state ungovern'd without laws or body made of nothing but diseases the one through impotency poor and wretched the other for the anarchy absurd
but lady for the revellers themselves it would be better in my poor conceit that others were employ'd for such as are unfit to be in cynthia's court can seem no less unfit to be in cynthia's sports
that crites is not purposed without particular knowledge of the goddess' mind who holding true intelligence what follies had crept into her palace she resolved of sports and triumphs under that pretext to have them muster in their pomp and fulness that so she might more strictly and to root effect the reformation she intends
i now conceive her heavenly drift in all and will apply my spirits to serve her will
o thou the very power by which i am and but for which it were in vain to be chief next diana virgin heavenly fair admired arete of them admired whose souls are not enkindled by the sense disdain not my chaste fire but feed the flame devoted truly to thy gracious name
leave to suspect us crites well shall find as we are now most dear we'll prove most kind
hark i am call'd
phoebus apollo if with ancient rites and due devotions i have ever hung elaborate paeans on thy golden shrine or sung thy triumphs in a lofty strain fit for a theatre of gods to hear and thou the other son of mighty jove cyllenian mercury sweet maia's joy if in the busy tumults of the mind my path thou ever hast illumined for which thine altars i have oft perfumed and deck'd thy statues with discolour'd flowers now thrive invention in this glorious court that not of bounty only but of right cynthia may grace and give it life by sight
queen and huntress chaste and fair now the sun is laid to sleep seated in thy silver chair state in wonted manner keep hesperus entreats thy light goddess excellently bright
earth let not thy envious shade dare itself to interpose cynthia's shining orb was made heav'n to clear when day did close bless us then with wished sight goddess excellently bright
lay thy bow of pearl apart and thy crystal shining quiver give unto the flying hart space to breathe how short soever thou that mak'st a day of night goddess excellently bright
when hath diana like an envious wretch that glitters only to his soothed self denying to the world the precious use of hoarded wealth withheld her friendly aid
monthly we spend our still repaired shine and not forbid our virgin waxen torch to burn and blaze while nutriment doth last that once consumed out of jove's treasury a new we take and stick it in our sphere to give the mutinous kind of wanting men their look'd for light
yet what is their desert
bounty is wrong'd interpreted as due mortals can challenge not a ray by right yet do expect the whole of cynthia's light
but if that deities withdrew their gifts for human follies what could men deserve but death and darkness
it behoves the high for their own sakes to do things worthily
most true most sacred goddess for the heavens receive no good of all the good they do nor jove nor you nor other heavenly powers are fed with fumes which do from incense rise or sacrifices reeking in their gore yet for the care which you of mortals have whose proper good it is that they be so you well are pleased with odours redolent but ignorant is all the race of men which still complains not knowing why or when
else noble arete they would not blame and tax or for unjust or for as proud thy cynthia in the things which are indeed the greatest glories in our starry crown such is our chastity which safely scorns not love for who more fervently doth love immortal honour and divine renown
but giddy cupid venus' frantic son
yet arete if by this veiled light we but discover'd what we not discern any the least of imputations stand ready to sprinkle our unspotted fame with note of lightness from these revels near not for the empire of the universe should night or court this whatsoever shine or grace of ours unhappily enjoy
place and occasion are two privy thieves and from poor innocent ladies often steal the best of things an honourable name to stay with follies or where faults may be infers a crime although the party free
how cynthianly that is how worthily and like herself the matchless cynthia speaks
infinite jealousies infinite regards do watch about the true virginity but phoebe lives from all not only fault but as from thought so from suspicion free
thy presence broad seals our delights for pure what's done in cynthia's sight is done secure
that then so answer'd dearest arete what th' argument or of what sort our sports are like to be this night i not demand
nothing which duty and desire to please bears written in the forehead comes amiss
but unto whose invention must we owe the complement of this night's furniture
excellent goddess to a man's whose worth without hyperbole i thus may praise one at least studious of deserving well and to speak truth indeed deserving well
potential merit stands for actual where only opportunity doth want not will nor power both which in him abound one whom the muses and minerva love for whom should they than crites more esteem whom phoebus though not fortune holdeth dear
and which convinceth excellence in him a principal admirer of yourself even through the ungentle injuries of fate and difficulties which do virtue choke thus much of him appears
what other things of farther note do lie unborn in him them i do leave for cherishment to shew and for a goddess graciously to judge
we have already judged him arete nor are we ignorant how noble minds suffer too much through those indignities which times and vicious persons cast on them
ourself have ever vowed to esteem as virtue for itself so fortune base who's first in worth the same be first in place
nor farther notice arete we crave then thine approval's sovereign warranty let 't be thy care to make us known to him cynthia shall brighten what the world made dim
clear pearl of heaven and not to be farther ambitious in titles cynthia
the fame of this illustrious night among others hath also drawn these four fair virgins from the palace of their queen perfection a word which makes no sufficient difference betwixt her's and thine to visit thy imperial court for she their sovereign not finding where to dwell among men before her return to heaven advised them wholly to consecrate themselves to thy celestial service as in whose clear spirit the proper element and sphere of virtue they should behold not her alone their ever honoured mistress but themselves more truly themselves to live enthronised
herself would have commended them unto thy favour more particularly but that she knows no commendation is more available with thee than that of proper virtue
nevertheless she willed them to present this crystal mound a note of monarchy and symbol of perfection to thy more worthy deity which as here by me they most humbly do so amongst the rarities thereof that is the chief to shew whatsoever the world hath excellent howsoever remote and various
but your irradiate judgment will soon discover the secrets of this little crystal world
themselves to appear more plainly because they know nothing more odious then false pretexts have chosen to express their several qualities thus in several colours
the first in citron colour is natural affection which given us to procure our good is sometime called storge and as every one is nearest to himself so this handmaid of reason allowable self love as it is without harm so are none without it her place in the court of perfection was to quicken minds in the pursuit of honour
her device is a perpendicular level upon a cube or square the word "se suo modulo" alluding to that true measure of one's self which as every one ought to make so is it most conspicuous in thy divine example
the second in green is aglaia delectable and pleasant conversation whose property it is to move a kindly delight and sometime not without laughter her office to entertain assemblies and keep societies together with fair familiarity
her device within a ring of clouds a heart with shine about it the word 'curarum nubila pello' an allegory of cynthia's light which no less clears the sky then her fair mirth the heart
the third in the discoloured mantle spangled all over is euphantaste a well conceited wittiness and employed in honouring the court with the riches of her pure invention
her device upon a petasus or mercurial hat a crescent the word "sic laus ingenii" inferring that the praise and glory of wit doth ever increase as doth thy growing moon
the fourth in white is apheleia a nymph as pure and simple as the soul or as an abrase table and is therefore called simplicity without folds without plaits without colour without counterfeit and to speak plainly plainness itself
her device is no device
the word under her silver shield "omnis abest fucus" alluding to thy spotless self who art as far from impurity as from mortality
myself celestial goddess more fit for the court of cynthia than the arbours of cytherea am called anteros or love's enemy the more welcome therefore to thy court and the fitter to conduct this quaternion who as they are thy professed votaries and for that cause adversaries to love yet thee perpetual virgin they both love and vow to love eternally
not without wonder nor without delight mine eyes have view'd in contemplation's depth this work of wit divine and excellent what shape what substance or what unknown power in virgin's habit crown'd with laurel leaves and olive branches woven in between on sea girt rocks like to a goddess shines
o all celestial sure and more than mortal
arete behold another cynthia and another queen whose glory like a lasting plenilune seems ignorant of what it is to wane
nor under heaven an object could be found more fit to please
let crites make approach
bounty forbids to pall our thanks with stay or to defer our favour after view the time of grace is when the cause is new
lo here the man celestial delia who like a circle bounded in itself contains as much as man in fulness may
lo here the man who not of usual earth but of that nobler and more precious mould which phoebus' self doth temper is composed and who though all were wanting to reward yet to himself he would not wanting be thy favours gain is his ambition's most and labour's best who humble in his height stands fixed silent in thy glorious sight
with no less pleasure than we have beheld this precious crystal work of rarest wit our eye doth read thee now instiled our crites whom learning virtue and our favour last exempteth from the gloomy multitude
with common eye the supreme should not see henceforth be ours the more thyself to be
heaven's purest light whose orb may be eclipsed but not thy praise divinest cynthia
how much too narrow for so high a grace thine save therein the most unworthy crites doth find himself
for ever shine thy fame thine honours ever as thy beauties do
in me they must my dark world's chiefest lights by whose propitious beams my powers are raised to hope some part of those most lofty points which blessed arete hath pleased to name as marks to which my endeavour's steps should bend mine as begun at thee in thee must end
a sister of phoebus to whose bright orb we owe that we not complain of his absence these four brethren for they are brethren and sons of eutaxia a lady known and highly beloved of your resplendent deity not able to be absent when cynthia held a solemnity officiously insinuate themselves into thy presence for as there are four cardinal virtues upon which the whole frame of the court doth move so are these the four cardinal properties without which the body of compliment moveth not
with these four silver javelins which they bear in their hands they support in princes' courts the state of the presence as by office they are obliged which though here they may seem superfluous yet for honour's sake they thus presume to visit thee having also been employed in the palace of queen perfection
and though to them that would make themselves gracious to a goddess sacrifices were fitter than presents or impresses yet they both hope thy favour and in place of either use several symbols containing the titles of thy imperial dignity
first the hithermost in the changeable blue and green robe is the commendably fashioned gallant eucosmos whose courtly habit is the grace of the presence and delight of the surveying eye whom ladies understand by the names of neat and elegant
his symbol is "divae virgini" in which he would express thy deity's principal glory which hath ever been virginity
the second in the rich accoutrement and robe of purple empaled with gold is eupathes who entertains his mind with an harmless but not incurious variety all the objects of his senses are sumptuous himself a gallant that without excess can make use of superfluity go richly in embroideries jewels and what not without vanity and fare delicately without gluttony and therefore not without cause is universally thought to be of fine humour
his symbol is "divae optimae" an attribute to express thy goodness in which thou so resemblest jove thy father
the third in the blush coloured suit is eutolmos as duly respecting others as never neglecting himself commonly known by the title of good audacity to courts and courtly assemblies a guest most acceptable
his symbol is "divae viragini" to express thy hardy courage in chase of savage beasts which harbour in woods and wildernesses
the fourth in watchet tinsel is the kind and truly benefique eucolos who imparteth not without respect but yet without difficulty and hath the happiness to make every kindness seem double by the timely and freely bestowing thereof
he is the chief of them who by the vulgar are said to be of good nature
his symbol is "divae maximae" an adjunct to signify thy greatness which in heaven earth and hell is formidable
a is not that amorphus the traveller
as though it were not
do you not see how his legs are in travail with a measure
hedon thy master is next
what will cupid turn nomenclator and cry them
no faith but i have a comedy toward that would not be lost for a kingdom
in good time for cupid will prove the comedy
mercury i am studying how to match them
how to mismatch them were harder
they are the nymphs must do it i shall sport myself with their passions above measure
those nymphs would be tamed a little indeed but i fear thou has not arrows for the purpose
o yes here be of all sorts flights rovers and butt shafts
but i can wound with a brandish and never draw bow for the matter
i cannot but believe it my invisible archer and yet methinks you are tedious
it behoves me to be somewhat circumspect mercury for if cynthia hear the twang of my bow she'll go near to whip me with the string therefore to prevent that i thus discharge a brandish upon it makes no matter which of the couples
phantaste and amorphus at you
will the shaking of a shaft strike them into such a fever of affection
as well as the wink of an eye but i pray thee hinder me not with thy prattle
jove forbid i hinder thee marry all that i fear is cynthia's presence which with the cold of her chastity casteth such an antiperistasis about the place that no heat of thine will tarry with the patient
it will tarry the rather for the antiperistasis will keep it in
i long to see the experiment
why their marrow boils already or they are all turn'd eunuchs
nay an't be so i'll give over speaking and be a spectator only
cynthia by my bright soul is a right exquisite and spendidious lady yet amorphus i think hath seen more fashions i am sure more countries but whether i have or not what need we gaze on cynthia that have ourself to admire
yet if phantaste sat where she does and had such attire on her head for attire can do much i say no more but goddesses are goddesses and phantaste is as she is
i would the revels were done once i might go to my school of glass again and learn to do myself right after all this ruffling
here's a wonderful change with your brandish
do you not hear how they dote
what prodigy is this
no word of love no mention no motion
not a word my little ignis fatue not a word
are my darts enchanted
is their vigour gone
is their virtue what
cupid turned jealous of himself
hath he not cause when his purpose is so deluded
a rare comedy it shall be entitled cupid's
do not scorn us hermes
choler and cupid are two fiery things i scorn them not
but i see that come to pass which i presaged in the beginning
you cannot tell perhaps the physic will not work so soon upon some as upon others
it may be the rest are not so resty
"ex ungue" you know the old adage as these so are the remainder
i'll try this is the same shaft with which i wounded argurion
ay but let me save you a labour cupid there were certain bottles of water fetch'd and drunk off since that time by these gallants
jove strike me into the earth
the fountain of self love
nay faint not cupid
i remember'd it not
faith it was ominous to take the name of anteros upon you you know not what charm or enchantment lies in the word you saw i durst not venture upon any device in our presentment but was content to be no other then a simple page
your arrows' properties to keep decorum cupid are suited it should seem to the nature of him you personate
indignity not to be borne
nay rather an attempt to have been forborne
how might i revenge myself on this insulting mercury
there's crites his minion he has not tasted of this water
it shall be so
is crites turn'd dotard on himself too
that follows not because the venom of your shafts cannot pierce him cupid
as though there were one antidote for these and another for him
as though there were not or as if one effect might not arise of diverse causes
what say you to cynthia arete phronesis time and others there
and crites aspires to be so
but that shall not serve him
'tis like to do it at this time
but cupid is grown too covetous that will not spare one of a multitude
one is more than a multitude
arete's favour makes any one shot proof against thee cupid
i pray thee light honey bee remember thou art not now in adonis' garden but in cynthia's presence where thorns lie in garrison about the roses
ladies and gallants of our court to end and give a timely period to our sports let us conclude them with declining night our empire is but of the darker half
and if you judge it any recompence for your faire pains t' have earn'd diana's thanks diana grants them and bestows their crown to gratify your acceptable zeal
for you are they that not as some have done do censure us as too severe and sour but as more rightly gracious to the good although we not deny unto the proud or the profane perhaps indeed austere for so actaeon by presuming far did to our grief incur a fatal doom and so swoln niobe comparing more than he presumed was trophaeed into stone
but are we therefore judged too extreme
seems it no crime to enter sacred bowers and hallowed places with impure aspect most lewdly to pollute
seems it no crime to brave a deity
let mortals learn to make religion of offending heaven
and not at all to censure powers divine
to men this argument should stand for firm a goddess did it therefore it was good we are not cruel nor delight in blood
but what have serious repetitions to do with revels and the sports of court
we not intend to sour your late delights with harsh expostulation
let it suffice that we take notice and can take revenge of these calumnious and lewd blasphemies
for we are no less cynthia than we were nor is our power but as ourself the same though we have now put on no tire of shine but mortal eyes undazzled may endure
years are beneath the spheres and time makes weak things under heaven not powers which govern heaven
and though ourself be in ourself secure yet let not mortals challenge to themselves immunity from thence
lo this is all honour hath store of spleen but wanteth gall
once more we cast the slumber of our thanks on your ta'en toil which here let take an end and that we not mistake your several worths nor you our favour from yourselves remove what makes you not yourselves those clouds of masque particular pains particular thanks do ask
let me view you
is there so little awe of our disdain that any under trust of their disguise should mix themselves with others of the court and without forehead boldly press so far as farther none
how apt is lenity to be abused
severity to be loath'd
and yet how much more doth the seeming face of neighbour virtues and their borrow'd names add of lewd boldness to loose vanities
who would have thought that philautia durst or have usurped noble storge's name or with that theft have ventured on our eyes
who would have thought that all of them should hope so much of our connivence as to come to grace themselves with titles not their own
instead of med'cines have we maladies
and such imposthumes as phantaste is grow in our palace
we must lance these sores or all will putrify
nor are these all for we suspect a farther fraud than this take off our veil that shadows many depart and shapes appear beloved arete so another face of things presents itself than did of late
feather'd cupid masqued and masked like anteros
dear mercury our brother like a page to countenance the ambush of the boy
nor endeth our discovery as yet gelaia like a nymph that but erewhile in male attire did serve anaides
cupid came hither to find sport and game who heretofore hath been too conversant among our train but never felt revenge and mercury bare cupid company
cupid we must confess this time of mirth proclaim'd by us gave opportunity to thy attempts although no privilege tempt us no farther we cannot endure thy presence longer vanish hence away
you mercury we must entreat to stay and hear what we determine of the rest for in this plot we well perceive your hand
but for we mean not a censorian task and yet to lance these ulcers grown so ripe dear arete and crites to you two we give the charge impose what pains you please th' incurable cut off the rest reform remembering ever what we first decreed since revels were proclaim'd let now none bleed
how well diana can distinguish times and sort her censures keeping to herself the doom of gods leaving the rest to us
come cite them crites first and then proceed
first philautia for she was the first then light gelaia in aglaia's name thirdly phantaste and moria next main follies all and of the female crew amorphus or eucosmos' counterfeit voluptuous hedon ta'en for eupathes brazen anaides and asotus last with his two pages morus and prosaites and thou the traveller's evil cos approach impostors all and male deformities nay forward for i delegate my power
and will that at thy mercy they do stand whom they so oft so plainly scorn'd before
'tis virtue which they want and wanting it honour no garment to their backs can fit
then crites practise thy discretion
adored cynthia and bright arete another might seem fitter for this task than crites far but that you judge not so for i not to appear vindicative or mindful of contempts which i contemn'd as done of impotence must be remiss who as i was the author in some sort to work their knowledge into cynthia's sight so should be much severer to revenge the indignity hence issuing to her name but there's not one of these who are unpain'd or by themselves unpunished for vice is like a fury to the vicious mind and turns delight itself to punishment
but we must forward to define their doom
you are offenders that must be confess'd do you confess it
and that you merit sharp correction
then we reserving unto delia's grace her farther pleasure and to arete what delia granteth thus do sentence you that from this place for penance known of all since you have drunk so deeply of self love you two and two singing a palinode march to your several homes by niobe's stone and offer up two tears a piece thereon that it may change the name as you must change and of a stone be called weeping cross because it standeth cross of cynthia's way one of whose names is sacred trivia
and after penance thus perform'd you pass in like set order not as midas did to wash his gold off into tagus' stream but to the well of knowledge helicon where purged of your present maladies which are not few nor slender you become such as you fain would seem and then return offering your service to great cynthia
this is your sentence if the goddess please to ratify it with her high consent the scope of wise mirth unto fruit is bent
we do approve thy censure belov'd crites which mercury thy true propitious friend a deity next jove beloved of us will undertake to see exactly done
and for this service of discovery perform'd by thee in honour of our name we vow to guerdon it with such due grace as shall become our bounty and thy place
princes that would their people should do well must at themselves begin as at the head for men by their example pattern out their imitations and regard of laws a virtuous court a world to virtue draws

now each one dry his weeping eyes and to the well of knowledge haste where purged of your maladies you may of sweeter waters taste and with refined voice report the grace of cynthia and her court
gentles be't known to you since i went in i am turn'd rhymer and do thus begin
