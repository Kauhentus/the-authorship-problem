this from our author far from all offence to abler writers or the audience met here to judge his poem
he by me presents his service with such modesty as well becomes his weakness
'tis no crime he hopes as we do in this curious time to be a little diffident when we are to please so many with one bill of fare
let others building on their merit say y'are in the wrong if you move not that way which they prescribe you as you were bound to learn their maximes but uncapable to discern 'twixt truth and falshood ours had rather be censur'd by some for too much obsequy then tax'd of self opinion if he hear that his endeavors thriv'd and did appear worthy your view though made so by your grace with some desert he in another place will thankfully report one leaf of bays truly confer'd upon this work will raise more pleasure in him you the givers free then garland ravisht from the virgin tree
enter gateazzo and julio
i dare not cross you sir but i would gladly provided you allow it render you my personal attendance
you shall better discharge the duty of an honest servant in following my instructions which you have receiv'd already then in questioning what my intents are or upon what motives my stay's resolv'd in mantua believe me that servant overdoes that's too officious and in presuming to direct your master you argue him of weakness and your self of arrogance and impertinence
i have done sir but what my ends are gal
honest ones i know it i have my bills of exchange and all provisions entrusted to you you have shewn your self just and discreet what would you more
and yet to satisfie in some part your curious care hear this and leave me i desire to be obscur'd and as i have demean'd my self these six moneths past in mantua i'll continue unnoted and unknown and at the best appear no more then a gentleman and a stranger that travails for his pleasure jul
with your pardon this hardly will hold weight though i should swear it with your noble friends and brother
you may tell'em since you will be my tutor there's a rumor almost cry'd up into a certainty of wars with florence and that i am determin'd to see the service whatere i went forth heaven prospering my intents i would come home a soldier and a good one
should you get a captains place nay colonels 'twould add little to what you are few of your rank will follow that dangerous profession gal
'tis the noblest and monarchs honor'd in it but no more on my displeasure
saints and angels guard you
a war indeed is threatned nay expected from florence but it is 'gainst me already proclaim'd in mantua i find it here no forein but intestine war i have defied my self in giving up my reason a slave to passion and am led captive before the battel's fought i fainted when i only saw mine enemy and yielded before that i was charg'd and though defeated i dare not sue for mercy like ixion i look on juno feel my heart turn cinders with an invisible fire and yet should she daign to appear cloth'd in a various cloud the majesty of the substance is so facred i durst not clasp the shadow i behold her with adoration feast my eye while all my other senses starve and oft frequenting the place which she makes happy with her presence i never yet had power with tongue or pen to move her to compassion or make known what 'tis i languish for yet i must gaze still though it increase my flame however i much more then fear i am observ'd and censur'd for bold intrusion
walks sadly enter beatrix and ascanio
know you boy that gentleman
hath not your honor marked him before
i have seen him often wait about the princess lodgings but ne'r ghess'd what his designs were
what a sigh he breath'd now
many such will blow up the roof on my small credit there's gunpowder in 'em
he's flesh and blood and devils only carry such roaring stuff about 'em you cannot prove he is or spirit or conjurer
that i grant but he's a lover and that's as bad their sighs are like petards and blow all up bea
i have been in love my self but never found yet that it could work such strange effects
true madam in women it cannot for when they miss th'enjoying of their full wishes all their sighs and heigh hoes at the worst breed timpanies and these are cur'd too with a kiss or two of their saint when he appears between a pair of sheets but with us men the case is otherwise
you will be breech'd boy for your physical maxims but how are you assur'd he is a lover
who i know with whom too but that is to be whisper'd
some proof of it i'll pay for my intelligence
let me kiss your honors hand 'twas ever fair but now beyond comparison
i ghess the reason a giving hand is still fair to the receiver
your ladiship's in the right but to the pur∣pose he is my client and pays his fees as duly as ever usurer did in a bad cause to his man of law and yet i get and take 'em both easily and honestly all the service i do him is to give him notice when and where the princess will appear and that i hope's no treason if you miss him when she goes to the vesper or the mattins hang me or when she takes the air be sure to find him near her coach at her going forth or coming back but if she walk he's ravisht i have seen him smel out her footing like a lime hound and knows it from all the rest of her train
yet i ne'r saw him present her a petition asc
nore'r shall he only sees her sighs and sacrifices a tear or two then vanishes
'tis most strange what a sad aspect he wears
but i'll make use of't
the princess is much troubled with the threats that come from florence i will bring her to him the novelty may afford her sport and help to purge deep melancholy
boy can you stay your client here for the third part of an hour
i have some ends in't
stay him madam fear not the present receipt of a round sum of crowns and that will draw most gallants from their prayers cannot drag him from me
ne'r doubt me i'll put him out of his dream
my little friend good morrow hath the princess slept well to night
i hear not from her women one murmur to the contrary
heaven be prais'd for't does she go to church this morning
troth i know not i keep no key of her de∣votion signior
'tis thought rather she is resolv'd to keep her chamber
why do you sigh
if that you have a business to be dispatch'd in court shew ready mony you shall find those that will prefer it for you
can any man have business but to see her then admire her and pray for her she being compos'd of goodness
for my self i find it a degree of happiness but to be near her and i think i pay a strict religious vow when i behold her and that's all my ambition
i believe you yet she being absent you may spend some hours with profit and delight too
after dinner the duke gives audience to a rough ambassador whom yet i never saw nor heard his title imploy'd from florence i'll help you to a place where you shall see and hear all
tis not worth my observation
what think you of an excellent comedy to be presented for his entertainment
he that penn'd it is the poet of the time and all the ladies i mean the amorous and learned ones except the princess will be there to grace it
what's that to me
without her all is no∣thing the light that shines in court cimerian darkness i will to bed agen and there contemplate on her perfections
enter matilda beatrix and two women
see the princess beyond our hopes
take that as moors salute the rising sun with joyful superstition i could fall down and worship
aside like phoebe breaking through an envious cloud or something which no simile can express she shews to me a reverend fear but blended with wonder and amazement does possess me now glut thy self my famish'd eye
that's he an't please your excellence
observe his posture but with a quarter look
your eye fix'd on him will breed astonish∣ment
i would not que∣stion your relation lady yet faintly can believe it how he eyes me
will he not speak
your excellence hath depriv'd him of speech and motion
these fits are usual with him
is it not ascanio a personated folly
or he a statue
if it be it is a master piece for man i cannot think him
for your sport vouchsafe him a little con∣ference
in compassion rather for should he love me as you say though hopeless it should not be return'd with scorn that were an inhumanity which my birth nor honor could priviledge were they greater
now i perceive he has life and motion in him to whom lady pays he that duty
bowing offers to go off
sans doubt to your self
and whither goes he now
to his private lodging but to what end i know not this is all i ever noted in him
call him back in pitty i stand bound to counsel him howe'r i am denied though i were willing to ease his sufferings
signior the princess commands you to attend her
what a lump of flesh is this
you are betraid sir to a better fortune then you durst ever hope for what a tantalus do you make your self
the flying fruit stays for you and the water that you long'd for rising up above your lip do you refuse to taste it
move faster sluggish camel or i will thrust this goad in your breech had i such a promising beard i should need the reins not spurs
you may come nearer why do you shake sir
if i flatter not my self there's no deformity about me nor any part so monstrous to beget an ague in you
it proceeds not madam from guilt but re∣verence
i believe you sir have you a suit to me
your excellence is wondrous fair
i thank your good opinion
and i beseech you that i may have licence to kneel to you
a suit i cannot cross
i humbly thank your excellence
but what as you are prostrate on your knee before me is your petition
i have none great princess mat
do you kneel for nothing
yes i have a suit but such a one as if denied will kill me
take comfort it must be of some strange nature unfitting you to ask or me to grant if i refuse it
it is madam mat
that i may not offend you this is all when i presume to look on you
to look on her
i should desire my self
to move a little further
and i beseech you madam to believe i never did yet with a wanton eye or cherish one lascivious wish beyond it
you'll never make good courtier or be in grace with ladies
or us waiting women if that be your nil ultra
he's no gentleman on my virginity it is apparent my tailor has more boldness nay my shoo maker will fumble a little further he could not have the length of my foot else
only to look on me
ends your ambition there
it does great lady and that confin'd too and at fitting distance the fly that plays too neer the flame burns in it
as i behold the sun the stars the temples i look upon you and wish'twere no sin should i adore you
come there's somthing more in't and since that you will make a goddess of me as such a one i'll tell you i desire not the meanest altar rais'd up to mine honor to be pull'd down i can accept from you be your condition nere so far beneath me one grain of incense with devotion offer'd beyond all perfumes or sabean spices by one that proudly thinks he merits in it i know you love me
next to heaven madam and with as pure a zeal
that we behold with th'eyes of contemplation but can arrive no nearer to it in this life but when that is divorc'd my soul shall serve yours and witness my affection
pray you rise but wait my further pleasure
enter farneze and uberti
i'll present you and give you proof i am your friend a true one and in my pleading for you teach the age that cals erroniously friendship but a name it is a substance
madam i am bold to trench so far upon your privacie as to desire my friend let not that wrong him for he's a worthy one may have the honor to kiss your hand
his own worth challengeth a greater favor
your acknowledgment confirms it madam if you look on him as he's built up a man without addition of fortunes liberal favors wealth or titles he doth deserve no usual entertainment
but as he is a prince and for your service hath left fair parma that acknowledges no other lord and uncompell'd exposes his person to the dangers of war ready to break in storms upon our heads in noble thankfulness you may vouchsafe him neerer respect and such grace as may nourish not kill his amorous hopes
cozen you know i am not the disposer of my self the duke my father challengeth that power yet thus much i dare promise prince uberti shall find the seed of service that he sows fals not on barren ground
for this high favor i am your creature and profess i owe you whatever i call mine
this great lord is a suitor to the princess
true he is so ga
fame gives him out too for a brave comander asca
and in it does him but deserved right the duke hath made him general of his horse on that assurance
and the lord farneze pleads for him as it seems
'tis too apparent and this consider'd give me leave to ask what hope have you sir
i may still look on her howe'r he wear the garland
a thin diet and will not feed you fat sir
i rejoice rare princess that you are not to be won by carpet courtship but the sword with this steel pen i'll write on florence helm how much i can and dare do for you
'tis not question'd some private business of mine own dispos'd of i'll meet you in the presence
now sir to you you have observ'd i doubt not for lovers are sharp
sighted to what purpose this prince sollicites me and yet i am not so taken with his worth but that i can vouchsafe you further parle
the first command that i'll impose upon you is to hear and follow my good councel i am not offended that you love me persist in it but love me vertuously such love may spur you to noble undertakings which atchiev'd will raise you into name preferment honor for all which though you ne'r enjoy my person for that's impossible you are indebted to your high aims visit me when you please i do allow it nor will blush to own you so you confine your self to what you promise as my vertuous servant
farewel sir you have an unexpected cordial
may it work well
your love yes so she said may spur you to brave undertakings adding this you may visit me when you please
is this allowed me and any act within the power of man impossible to be effected
no i will break through all oppositions that may stop me in my full carier to honor and borrowing strength to do from her high favor add somthing to alcides greatest labor
enter gonzaga vberti farneze manfroy attendants
this is your place and were it in our power you should have greater honor prince of parma the rest know theirs let some attend with care on the ambassador and let my daughter be present at his audience
reach a chair we'll do all fit respects and pray you put on your milder looks you are in a place where frowns are no prevailing agents
enter at one door alonzo and attendants matilda beatrix ascanio galeazo and waiting women at the other
asc i have seen more then a wolf a gorgon swouns gon
a page of mine is faln into a swoun look to him carefully
now when you please the cause that brought you hither
the protraction of my dispatch forgotten from lorenzo the tuscan duke thus much to you gonzaga the duke of mantua by me his nephew he does salute you fairly and intreats a word not suitable to his power and greatness you would consent to tender that which he unwillingly must force if contradicted
ambition in a private man a vice is in a prince the vertue
to the purpose these ambages are im∣pertinent
he demands the fair matilda for i dare not take from her perfections in a noble way and in creating her the comfort of his royal bed to raise her to a height her flattering hopes could not aspire where she with wonder shall be gaz'd upon and live the envy of her sex
or if denied what follows
present war with all extremities the con∣queror can inflict upon the vanquish'd
grant me licence to answer this defiance what intelligence holds your proud master with the will of heaven that ere th'uncertain dye of war be thrown he dares assure himself the victory
are his unjust invading arms of fire
or those we put on in defence of right like chaff to be consum'd in the encounter
i look on your dimensions and find not mine own of lesser size the blood that fills my veins as hot as yours my sword as sharp my nerves of equal strength my heart as good and confident we have the better cause why should we fear the trial
you presume you are superior in numbers we lay hold upon the surest anchor vertue which when the tempest of the war roars loudest must prove a strong protection
two main reasons seconding those you have already heard gives us encouragement the duty that i owe my mother country and the love descending to my daughter
for the first should i betray her liberty i deserv'd to have my name with infamy raz'd from the catalogue of good princes and i should unnaturally forget i am a father if like a tartar or for fear or profit i should consign her as a bondwoman to be dispos'd of at anothers pleasure her own consent or favor never su'd for and mine by force exacted
no alonzo she is my only child my heir and if a fathers eyes deceive me not the hand of prodigal nature hath given so much to her as in the former ages kings would rise up in her defence and makes her cause their quarrel nor can she if that any spark remain to kindle a desire to be possest of such a beauty in our time want swords to guard it safe from violence
i must speak or i shall burst now to be silent were a kind of blasphemy
if such purity such innocence an abstract of perfection the soul of beauty vertue in a word a temple of things sacred should groan under the burthen of opprestion we might accuse the saints and tax the powers above us of negligence or injustice
pardon sir a strangers boldness and in your mercy call it true zeal not rudeness in a cause like this the husbandman would change his ploughing irons to weapons of defence and leave the earth untill'd although a general dearth should follow the student would forswear his book the lawyer put off his thriving gown and without pay conclude this case is to be fought not pleaded the women will turn amazons as their sex in her were wrong'd and boys write down their names i'th' muster book for soldiers
take my hand whatev'r you are i thank you how are you call'd
i wish mantua had many such
my lord ambassador some privacie if you please manfroy you may partake it and advise us
do you know friend what this man is or of what country
i'll question him my self what are you sir
but if there be gradation in gentry as the heralds say you have been overbold in the presence of your betters
as i take it you are no prince
'tis fortunes gift you were born one i have not heard that glorious title crowns you as a reward of vertue it may be the first of your house deserv'd it yet his merits you can but faintly call your own
you come up to me
i would not turn my back if you were the duke of florence though you charg'd me i'th' head of our troops
tell me in gentler language your passionate speech induces me to think so do you love the princess
were you mine enemy your foot upon my breast sword at my throat even then i would profess it
the ascent to th'height of honor is by arts or arms and if such an unequall'd prize might fall on him that did deserve best in defence of this rare princess in the day of battail i should lead you a way would make your greatness sweat drops of blood to follow
can your excellence hear this without rebuke from one unknown
is he a rival for a prince
my lord you take that liberty i never gave you in justice you should give encouragement to him or any man that freely offers his life to do me service not deter him i give no suffrage to it grant he loves me as he professes how are you wrong'd in it
would you have all men hate me but your self
no more of this i pray you if this gentleman fight for my freedom in a fit proportion to his desert and quality i can and will reward him yet give you no cause of jealousie or envy
no peace but on such poor and base con∣ditions
we will not buy it at that rate return this answer to your master though we wish'd to hold fair quarter with him on such terms as honor would give way to we are not so thunder struck with the loud voice of war as to acknowledg him our lord before his sword hath made us vassals we long since have had intelligence of the unjust gripe he purpos'd to lay on us neither are we so unprovided as you think my lord he shall not need to seek us we will meet him and prove the fortune of a day perhaps sooner then he expects
and find repentance when 'tis too late
no my matilda we must not part so beasts and birds of prey to their last gasp defend their brood and florence over thy fathers breast shall march up to thee before he force affection the arms that thou must put on for us and thy self are prayers and pure devotion which will be heard matilda
mansroy to your trust we do give up the city and my daughter on both keep a strong guard no tears they are ominous
o my octavio my try'd octavio in all my dangers
now i want thy service in passion recompenc'd with banishment
error of princes who hate vertue when she's present with us and in vain admire her when she is absent
'tis too late to think on't the wish'd for time is come princely uberti to shew your valour friends being to do not talk
all rhetorick is fruitless only this fate cannot rob you of deserv'd applause whether you win or lose in such a cause
enter matilda beatrix and two women
matter for the ring i ask'd you for the boy not to be found
nor heard of madam wo
he hath been sought and searcht for house by house nay every nook of the city but to no purpose
and how he should escape hence the lord manfroy being so vigilant ore the guards appears a thing impossible
i never saw him since he swouned in the presence when my father gave audience to the ambassador but i feel a sad miss of him on any slight occasion he would find out such pretty arguments to make me sport and with such witty sweetness deliver his opinion that i must ingeniously confess his harmless mirth when i was most opprest with care wrought more in the removing of it then musick on me
an't please your excellence i have observ'd him waggishly witty yet sometimes on the sudden he would be very pensive and then talk so feelingly of love as if he had tasted the bitter sweets of't
he would tell too a pretty tale of a sister that had been deceiv'd by her sweetheart and then weeping swear he wonder'd how men could be false wo
and that when he was a knight he would be the ladies champion and travel ore the world to kill such lovers as durst play false with their mistresses mat
i am sure i want his company enter manfroy with a letter
there are letters madam in post come from the duke but i am charg'd by the careful bringer not to open them but in your presence
heaven preserve my father
good news an't be thy will
patience must arm you against what's ill
i'll hear 'em in my cabinet exeunt
enter galeazo and ascanio with a ring
gal why have you left the safety of the city and service of the princess to partake the dangers of the camp
and at a time too when the armies are in view and every minute the dreadful charge expected
you appear so far beyond your self as you are now arm'd like a soldier though i grant your presence was ever gracious that i grow enamour'd of the profession in the horror of it there is a kind of majesty
but too heavy to sit on thy soft shoulders youth retire to the dukes tent that's guarded
sir i come to serve you knights adventurers are allow'd their pages and i bring a will that shall supply my want of power
to serve me boy
i wish believe it that 'twere in my nerves to do thee any service and thou shalt if i survive the fortune of this day be satisfied i am serious
i am not to be put off so sir since you do neglect my offer'd duty i must use the power i bring along with me that may command you you have seen this ring
made rich by being worne upon the princess finger
'tis a favour to you by me sent from her view it better but why coy to receive it
i am unworthy of such a blessing i have done nothing yet that may deserve it no commanders blood of th'adverse party hath yet dy'd my sword drawn out in her defence
i must not take it
this were a triumph for me when i had made florence duke my prisoner and compell'd him to kneel for mercy at her feet
'twas sent sir to put you in mind whose cause it is you fight for and as i am her creature to revenge a wrong to me done
let it suffice i know him by his armor and his horse and if we meet i am cut off the alarum commands me hence sweet youth fall off
i must not you are too noble to receive a wound upon your back and following close behind you i am secure though i could wish my bosom were your defence
thy kindness will undo thee

i never shunn'd a single opposition but tell me why in the battel of all men thou hast made choice of me
look on this youth his cause sits on my sword alon
i know him not
i'll help your memory
what have i done
i am doubtful to whom to wish the victory for still my resolution wavering i so love the enemy that wrong'd me that i cannot without repentance wish success to him that seeks to do me right
as you are gentle hold sir
or if i want power to perswade so far i conjure you by her lov'd name i am sent from
'tis a charm too strong to be resisted he is yours
yet why should you make suit to save that life which you so late desir'd should be cut off for injuries receiv'd begets my wonder
alas we foolish spleenful boys would have we know not what i have some private reasons but now not to be told
shall i take him prisoner
by no means sir i will not save his life to rob him of his honor when you give give not by halves one short word and i follow
my lord alonzo if you have receiv'd a benefit and would know to whom you owe it remember what your entertainment was at old octavio's house one you call'd friend and how you did return it
i remember i did not well but it is now no time to think upon't my wounded honor calls for reparation i must quench my fury for this disgrace in blood and some shall smart for't
o prince vberti valour cannot save us the body of our army's pierc'd and broken the wings are routed and our scattered troops not to be rallied up
vber 'tis yet some comfort the enemy must say we were not wanting in courage or direction and we may accuse the powers above us partial when a good cause well defended too must suffer for want of fortune
all is lost the duke too far engag'd i fear to be brought off three times i did attempt his rescue but with odds was beaten back only the stranger i speak it to my shame still follow'd him cutting his way but 'tis beyond my hopes that either should return
that noble stranger whom i in my proud vanity of greatness as one unknown contemn'd when i was thrown out of my saddle by the great dukes lance hors'd me again in spight of all that made resistance and then whisper'd in mine ear fight bravely prince uberti there's no way else to the fair matilda's favour
in you my bosom friend i had call'd it noble but such a courtesie from a rival merits the highest attribute
enter galeazo and gonzaga
stand on your guard we are pursu'd
the duke in safety
pay your thanks farneze to this brave man if i may call him so whose acts were more then humane if thou art my better angel from my infancie design'd to guard me like thy self appear for sure thou art more then mortal
no great sir a weak and sinful man though i have done you some prosperous service that hath found your favour i am lost to my self but lose not you the offer'd opportunity to delude the hot pursuing enemy these woods nor the dark vail of night cannot conceal you if you dwell long here you may rise again but i am faln for ever
rather borne up to the supreme sphere of honor
i confess my life your gift
my liberty you have snatch'd the wreath of conquest from the victors head and do alone in scorn of lorenzo's fortune though we are slav'd by true heroick valour deserve a triumph
from whence then proceeds this poor dejection
gal in one suit i'll tell you which i beseech you grant i lov'd your daughter but how
as beggers in their wounded fancie hope to be monarchs i long languish'd for her but did receive no cordial but what despair my rough physitian prescrib'd me
at length her goodness and compassion found it
and whereas i expected and with reason the distance and disparity consider'd between her birth and mine she would contemn me the princess gave me comfort
she did admit me for her knight and servant and spurr'd me to do something in this battel fought for her liberty that might not blemish so fair a favour
this you hrve perform'd to th'height of admiration
i subscribe to't that am your rival
you are charitable but how short of my hopes nay the assurance of those atchievements which my love and youth already held accomplisn'd this days fortune must sadly answer
what i did she gave me the strength to do her piety preserv'd her father and her gratitude for the dangers you threw your self into for her defence protected you by me her instrument but when i came to strike in mine own cause and to do somthing so remarkable that should at my return command her thanks and gracious entertainment then alas i fainted like a coward i made a vow too and it is registred ne'r to presume to come into her presence if i brought not her fears and dangers bound in fetters to her which now's impossible
hark the enemy makes his approaches save your selves this only deliver to her sweetness i have done my poor endeavours and pray her not repent her goodness to me may you live to serve her this loss recover'd with a happier fate and make use of this sword arms i abjure and conversation of men i'll seek out some unfrequented cave and die loves martyr
'tis in vain his nimble feet have born him from my sight
i suffer for him far
we share in it but must not sir forget your means of safety
in the war i have serv'd you and to the death will follow you
'tis not fit we must divide our selves
my daughter if i retain yet a soveraigns power ore thee or friends with you do and dispute not by my example change your habits as i thus put off my purple ambition dies this garment of a shepherd left here by chance will serve in lieu of it i leave this to the owner
raise new forces and meet me at leo's fort my daughter as i commanded manfroy there will meet us

you still shall have my heart
enter lorenzo alonzo pisano martino captains soldiers
the day is ours though it cost dear yet 'tis not enough to get a victory if we lose the true use of it
we have hitherto held back your forward swords and in our fear of ambushes deferr'd the wish'd reward due to your bloody toil but now give freedom nay licence to your fury and revenge now glut your selves with prey let not the night nor these thick woods give sanctuary to the fear struck hares our enemies fire these trees and force the wretches to forsake their holes and offer their scorch'd bodies to your swords or burn'em as a sacrifice to your angers
who brings gonzaga's head or takes him prisoner which i incline to rather that he may be sensible of those tortures which i vow t'inflict upon him for denial of his daughter to our bed shall have a blank with our hand and signet made authentical in which he may write down himself what wealth or honors he desires alon
the great dukes will shall be obeyed pisa
put it in execution
begirt the wood and fire it
enter farneze with a florentine soldiers coat
o my friend dearer then life
i have lost thee
cruel fortune unsatisfied with our sufferings
we no sooner were parted from the duke and even then ready to make a mutual farewel when a troop of the enemies horse fell on us we were forc'd to take the woods again but in our flight their hot pursuit divided us we had been happy if we had died together to survive him to me is worse then death and therefore should not embrace the means of my escape though offer'd
when nature gave us life she gave a burthen but at our pleasure not to be cast off though weary of it and my reason prompts me this habit of a florentine which i took from a dying soldier may keep me unknown till opportunity mark me out a way for flight and with security
was there ever such a night of horror
i now in part forgive thee fortune
the wood flames the bloody sword devours all that it meets and death in several shapes rides here in triumph
i am like a stag clos'd in a toil my life as soon as found the cruel huntsmans prey why fliest thou then what is inevitable
better to fall with manly wounds before thy cruel enemy then survive thine honor and yet to charge him and die unreveng'd meer desperation
mine own life i contemn and would not save it but for the future service of the duke and safety of his daughter having means if i escape to raise a second army and what is nearest to me to enjoy my friend farneze
i am still his care uber
what shall i do
if i call loud the foe that hath begirt the wood will hear the sound
shall i return by the same path
i cannot the darkness of the night conceals it from me something i must resolve
let friendship rouze thy sleeping soul farneze wilt thou suffer thy friend a prince nay one that may set free thy captiv'd country perish when 'tis in thy power with this disguise to save his life
thou hast liv'd too long therefore resolve to die thou hast seen thy country ruin'd and thy master compell'd to shameful flight the fields and woods straw'd ore with carkasses of thy fellow soldiers the miseries thou art faln in and before thy eyes the horror of this place and thousand calamities to come and after all these can any hope remain
shake off delays dost thou doubt yet
to save a citizen the conquering roman in a general esteem'd the highest honor can it be then inglorious to preserve a prince
uberti prince uberti use this means of thy escape conceal'd in this thou maist pass through the enemies guards the time denies longer discourse thou hast a noble end live therefore mindful of thy dyng friend exit
farneze stay thy hasty steps farneze
thy friend uberti cals thee 'tis in vain he's gone to death an innocent and makes life the benefit he confers on me my guilt
thou art too covetous of anothers safety too prodigal and careless of thine own 'tis a deceit in friendship to enjoin me to put this garment on and live that he may have alone the honor to die nobly
o cruel piety in our equal danger to rob thy self of that thou givest thy friend
it must not be i will restore his gift and die before him

what blind fury brings forth this brawl
alonzo and pisano at bloody difference
hold or i tilt at both as enemies
now speak how grew this strange division
against all right by force alonzo strives to reap the harvest sown by my labour
sir this is my prisoner the purchase of my sword which proud pisano that hath no interest in him would take from me
did not the presence of the duke forbid me i would say alon
and was this the cause of such a mortal quarrel
this the base to raise your fury on
the tyes of blood of fellowship in arms respect obedience to me your prince and general no more prevailing on you
this a price for which you would betray our victory or wound your reputation with mutinies
forgetful of your selves allegiance honor
this is a course to throw us headlong down from that proud height of empire upon which we were securely seared shall division oreturn what concord built
if you desire to bath your swords in blood the enemy still flies before you would you have spoil
the country lies open to you
o unheard of madness
what greater mischief could gonzaga wish us then you pluck on our heads

death at length will set a period to calamity
i see it in this tyrants frowns haste to me
enter uberti like a soldier and shuffles in among 'em
thou machine of this mischief look to feel whate're the wrath of an incensed prince can pour upon thee with thy blood i'll quench but drawn forth slowly the invisible flames of discord by thy charms first fetch'd from hell then forc'd into the breasts of my commanders
bring forth the tortures
hear victorious duke the story of my miserable fortune of which this villain by your sacred tongue condemn'd to die was the immediate cause and if my humble suit have justice in it vouchsafe to grant it
soldier be brief our anger can brook no long delay
i am the last of three sons by one father got and train'd up with his best care for service in your wars my father dyed under his fatal hand and two of my poor brothers
now i hear or fancie wounded by my grief deludes me their pale and mangled ghosts crying for ven∣geance on perjury and murther
thus the case stood
my father on whose face he he durst not look in equal mart by his fraud circumvented became his captive we his sons lamenting our old sires hard condition freely offer'd our utmost for his ransom
that refus'd the subtile tyrant for his cruel ends conceiving that our piety might insnare us propos'd my fathers head to be redeem'd if two of us would yield our selves his slaves
we upon any terms resolv'd to save him though with the loss of life which he gave to us with an undaunted constancie drew lots for each of us contented to be one who should preserve our father i was exempted but to my more affliction my brothers delivered up the perjur'd homicide laughing in scorn and by his hoary locks pulling my wretched father on his knees said thus receive the father you have ransom'd and instantly struck off his head
i never saw this man
one murmur more i'll have thy tongue pull'd out
conceive sir how thunder struck we stood being made spectators of such an unexpected tragedy yet this was a beginning not an end to his intended cruelty for pursuing such a revenge as no hircanian tigress rob'd of her whelps durst aim at in a moment treading upon my fathers trunk he cut off my pious brothers heads and threw'em at me
oh what a spectacle was this
what mountain of sorrow overwhelm'd me
my poor heartstrings as tenter'd by his tyrannie crack'd my knees beating 'gainst one another groans and tears blended together followed not one passion calamity ever yet express'd forgotten
now mighty sir bathing your feet with tears your suppliants suit is that he may have leave with any cruelty revenge can fancie to sacrifice this monster to appease my fathers ghost and brothers
thou hast obtain'd it choose any torture let the memory of what thy father and thy brothers suffer'd make thee ingenious in it such a one as phalaris would wish to be call'd his

stand forth and tremble this weapon of late drunk with innocent blood shall now carouse thine own
pray if thou canst for though the world shall not redeem thy body i would not kill thy soul

tell me thou hangman where did i ever see thy face
or when murder'd thy sire or brothers
look on me and make it good thou dar'st not

friend or foe in this alike i value i disdain to yield priority draw thy sword
to sheath it in thy ambitious heart
o curb this fury and hear a wretched maid first speak
i am marble mat
where shall i seek out words or how re∣strain my enemies rage or lovers
oh the latter is far more odious did not your lust provoke you for that is its proper name my chastity were safe and yet i tremble more to think what dire effects lust may bring forth then what as enemies you can inflict and less i fear it
be friends to your selves and enemies to me better i fall a sacrifice to your attonement then or one or both should perish
i am the cause of your division remove it lords and concord will spring up poison this face that hath bewitch'd you this grove cannot want aspicks or toads creatures though justly call'd for their deformity the scorn of nature more happy then my self with this false beauty the seed and fruit of mischief you admire so

to prevent her flight while we contend let's bind her fast to this cipress tree
it does presage my funeral rites

you never did do ill my vertuous servant nor is it in the power of poor matilda to cancel such an obligation as with humble willingness she must subscribe to
give me a fitter name your manumissed bondwoman but even now in the possession of lust from which your more then brave heroick valor bought me and can i then for freedom unexpected but kneel to you my patron
for heav'ns sake rise i kiss the ground you tread on my eyes fix'd on the earth for i confess i am a thing not worthy to look on you till you have sign'd my pardon
do you interpret the much good you have done me an offence
the not performing your injunctions to me is more then capital your allowance of my love and service to you with admission to each place you made paradise with your presence should have inabled me to bring home conquest
then as a sacrifice to offer it at the altar of your favor had my love answer'd your bounty or my hopes an army had been as dust before me whereas i like a coward turn'd my back and durst not stand the sury of the enemy
had you done nothing in the battel this last act deserves more then i the duke my father joining with me can ever recompence
but take your pleasure suppose you have offended in not grasping your boundless hopes i thus seal on your lips a full remission
let mine touch your foot your hand's too high a favour
will you force me to ravish a kiss from you
so much desert and bashfulness should not march in the same file take comfort when you have brought me to some place of security you shall find you have a seat here a heart that hath already studied and vow'd to be thankful

because sir i will trust my heels before all winds that blow in the sky we are wiser far then our grandsires were and in this i'll prove it they said haste to the beginning of a feast there i am with 'em but to the end of a fray that is apocryphal 'tis more canonical not to come there at all after a strom there are still some drops behind
pure fear hath made the fool a philosopher
i did not erre here lie two brave men weltring in their own gore
i am in a swoun to look on't
they are stiff already
but are you sure they are dead
too sure i fear
goth but are they stark dead

tear ope his doublet and prove if his wounds be mortal goth
fear not me sir here's large wound how it is swoln and impostum'd
his pocket this must be cunningly drawn out should it break puls out his purse
'twould strangle him what a deal of foul matter's here
this hath been long a gathering here's a gash too on the reme of his belly it may have matter in it
he was a cholerique man sure what comes from him gold is yellow as gold how troubled with the stone too

incensed cupid whom even now i scorn'd hath took his stand and by reflexion shines as if he had two bodies or indeed a brother twin whom sight cannot distinguish in her fair eyes see how they head their arrows with her bright beams now frown as if my heart rebellious to their edicts were unworthy should i rip up my bosom to receive a wound from such divine artillery
i am made for ever mat
we are lost dear servant
vertue's but a word fortune rules all
we are her tennis balls
allow her fair her symetrie and features so well proportion'd as the heavenly object with admiration would strike ovid dumb nay force him to forget his faculty in verse and celebrate her praise in prose what's this to me

wrastle with her i will wager ten to one on your graces side
slave hast thou brought me temptation in a beauty not to be with prayers resisted and in place of councel to master my affections and to guard my honor now besieg'd by lust with the arms of sober temperance mark me out a way to be a ravisher
would thou hadst shewn me some monster though in a more ugly form then nile or africk ever bred

love soothing passions nay idolatry i must pay to her
hence and with thee take this second but more dangerous pandora whose fatal box if open'd will pour on me all mischiefs that mankind is subject to

some spark of hope remains yet
come you are mine now i will remove her where your highness shall not or see or hear more of her what a sum will she yield for the turks serraglio
stay i feel a sudden alteration
here are fine whimsies
why should i part with her
can any foul∣ness inhabit such a clean and gorgeous palace
the fish the fowl the beasts may safer leave the elements they were nourish'd in and live then i endure her absence yet her presence is a torment to me why do i call it so
my sire enjoy'd a woman i had not been else he was a compleat prince and shall i blush to follow his example
oh but my choice though she gave suffrage to it is beneath me but even now in my proud thoughts i scorn'd a princess fair matilda and is't decreed for punishment i straight must dote on one what or from whence i know not
grant she be obscure without a coat or family those i can give and yet if she were noble my fondness were more pardonable
martino dost thou know thy prisoner
do i know my self
i kept that for the lenvoy 'tis the daughter of your enemy duke gonzaga
i now call to my memory her picture and find this is the substance but her painter did her much wrong i see it mart
i am sure i tugg'd hard for her here are wounds can witness before i could call her mine
no matter how make thine own ransom i will pay it for her
i knew it would come at last
we are lost again
that his knee that never yet bow'd to mor∣tality kneels kisses the earth happy to bear your weight i know begets your wonder
hear the reason and cast it off your beauty does command it till now i never saw you same hath been too sparing in report of your perfections which now with admiration i gaze on
be not afraid fair virgin had you been imploy'd to mediate your fathers cause my drum had been unbrac'd my trumpet hung up nor had the terror of the war ere frighted his peaceful confines your demands had been as soon as spoke agreed to
but you'll answer and may with reason words make no satisfaction for what's in fact committed
yet take comfort something my pious love commands me do which may call down your pardon
this expression of reverence to your person better suits takes him up and kneels
with my low fortune
that you daign to love me my weakness would perswade me to believe though conscious of mine own unworthiness you being as the liberal eye of heaven which may shine where it pleases let your beams of favour warm and comfort me not consume me for should your love grow to excess i dare not deliver what i fear
dry your fair eyes i apprehend your doubts and could be angry if humble love could warrant it you should nourish such base thoughts of me heaven bear witness and if i break my vow dart thunder at me you are and shall be in my tent as free from fear of violence as a cloyster'd nun kneeling before the altar
what i purpose is yet an embrion but grown into form i'll give you power to be the sweet disposer of blessings unexpected that your father your country people children yet unborn too in holy hymns on festivals shall sing the triumph of your beauty
on your hand once more i swear it o imperious love
look down and as i truly do repent prosper the good ends of thy penitent
enter octavio and maria
you must not be too sudden my maria in being known i am in this friars habit as yet conceal'd though his recovery be almost certain i must work him to repentance by degrees
when i would have you appear in your true shape of sorrow to move his compassion i will stamp thus then you know to act your part
i shall be careful
if i can cure the ulcers of his mind as i despair not of his bodies wounds felicity crowns my labour
desire my patients to leave their chamber and take fresh air here how have they slept
very well sir i would we were so rid of 'em
i fear one hath the art of memory and will remember his gold and jewels could you not mi∣nister a potion of forgetfulness
what would gallants that are in debt give me for such a receipt to pour in their creditors drink
you shall restore all believ't you shall will you please to walk
will you please to put off your holy habit and spic'd conscience
one i think infects the other
i have observ'd compunction in alonzo he speaks little but full of retir'd thoughts the other is jocund and merry no doubt because he hath the less accompt to make here
reverend sir i come to wait your pleasure but my friend your creature i should say being so my self willing to take farther repose intreats your patience a few minutes
at his pleasure pray you sit down you are faint still
growing to strength i thank your goodness but my mind is troubled very much troubled sir and i desire your pious habit giving me assurance please of your skill and power that way that you would to be my my minds physitian
sir to that my order binds me if you please to unload the burthen of your conscience i will minister such heavenly cordials as i can and set you in a path that leads to comfort
i will open my bosoms secrets to you that i am a man of blood being brought up in the wars and cruel executions my profession admits not to be question'd but in that being a subject and bound to obey whate'r my prince commanded i have left some shadow of excuse with other crimes as pride lust gluttony it must be told i am besmear'd all over
on repentance mercy will wash it off
o sir i grant these sins are deadly ones yet their frequencie with wicked men make them less dreadful to us
but i am conscious of one crime with which all ills i have committed from my youth put in the scale weigh nothing such a crime so odious to heaven and man and to my sear'd up conscience so full of horror as penance cannot expiate
despair not 'tis impious in man to prescribe limits to the divine compassion out with it
hear then good man and when that i have given you the character of it and confess'd my self the wretch that acted it you must repent the charity you have extended towards me
not long before these wars began i had acquaintance 'tis not fit i stile it friendship that being a vertue and not to be blended with vitious breach of faith with the lord octavio the minion of his prince and court set off with all the pomp and circumstance of greatness to this then happy man i offer'd service and with infinuation wrought my self into his knowledg grew familiar with him ever a welcom guest
this noble gentleman was bless'd with one fair daughter so he thought and boldly might believe so for she was in all things excellent without a rival till i her fathers mass of wealth before my greedy eyes but hoodwink'd to mine honor with far more subtle arts then perjur'd paris ere practis'd on poor credulous oenone besieg'd her virgin fort in a word took it no vows or imprecation forgotten with speed to marry her
perhaps she gave you just cause to break those vows
alas her innocence knew no guilt but too much favor to me unworthy of it 'twas my baseness my foul ingratitude what shall i say more
the good octavio no sooner fell in the displeasure of his prince his state confiscated and he forc'd to leave the court and she expos'd to want but all my oaths and protestation of service to her like seeming flames rais'd by inchantment vanish'd this this sits heavy here
he speaks as if he were acquainted with my plot you have reason to feel compunction for 'twas most inhumane so to betray a maid
but does your sorrow for the fact beget an aptness in you to make satisfaction for the wrong you did her
it is my only study since i tasted of your compassion these eyes ne'r were clos'd but fearful dreams cut off my little sleep and being awake in my imagination her apparition haunted me
'twas meer fancie he stamps alon
'twas more grave sir nay 'tis now it appears
do you not see there the gliding shadow of a fair virgin
that is she and wears the very garments that adorn'd her when she yielded to my crocodile tears a cloud of fears and diffidence then so chac'd away her purer white and red as it foretold that i should be disloyal
for 'twere a sin far far exceeding all i have committed to hope only that thou art a substance look on my true sorrow nay souls contrition hear again those vows my perjury cancell'd stamp'd in brass and never to be worn out
i can endure no more action not oaths must make me reparation i am maria
it is and i octavio
how shall i look on you
or with what forehead desire your pardon
you truly shall deserve it in being constant oct
if you fall not off but look on her in poverty with those eyes as when she was my heir in expectation you thought her beautiful
she's in herself both indies to me
stay she shall not come a begger to you my sweet young mistress
no she shall not want a dower here's white and red will ask a jointure but how you should make her being a captain would beget some doubt if you should deal with a lawyer
i have seen this purse goth
how the worl'ds given i dare not say to lying because you are a soldier you may say as well this gold is mark'd too you being to receive it should ne'r ask how i got it
i'll run for a priest to dispatch the matter you shall not want a ring i have one for the purpose
now sir i think i am honest
this ring was pisano's
i'll dissolve this riddle at better leisure the wound given to my daughter which in your honor you are bound to cure exacts our present care
i am all yours sir

thou hast told too much to give assurance that her honor was too far engag'd to be by humane help redeem'd if thou hadst given thy sad narration this full period she's dead i had been happy
sir these tears do well become a father and my eyes would keep you company as a forlorn lover but that the burning fire of my revenge dries up those drops of sorrow
we once more our broken forces rallied up and with full numbers strengthen'd stand prepar'd to endure a second trial nor let it dismay us that we are once again to affront the fury of a victorious army their abuse of conquest hath disarm'd themselves and call'd down the powers above to aid us
i have read some piece of story yet ne'r found but that the general that gave way to cruelty the profanation of things sacred rapes of virgins butchery of infants and the massacre in cold blood of reverend age against the discipline and law of arms did feel the hand of heaven lie heavy on him when most secure we have had a late example and let us not despair but that in lorenzo it will be seconded
you argue well and 'twere a sin in me to contradict you yet we must not neglect the means that's lent us to be the ministers of justice
no sir one day given to refresh our wearied troops tir'd with a tedious march we'll be no longer coop'd up but charge the enemy in his trenches and force him to a battel shouts within gonz
in such a general time of mourning shouts and acclamations of joy
long live the princess
within they cry uber
the princess name matilda oft re eccho'd
what speaks thy haste
more joy and happiness then weak words can deliver or strong faith almost give credit to the princess lives i saw her kist her hand
that is not to be stall'd by my report this only must be told as i rode forth with some choise troops to make discovery where the enemy lay and how intrench'd a leader of th'adverse party but unarm'd and in his hand an olive branch encounter'd me he shew'd the great dukes seal that gave him power to parly with me his desires were that assurance for his safety might be granted to his royal master who came as a friend and not as an enemy to offer to you conditions of peace
i yielded to it
this being return'd the dukes pretorum open'd when suddenly in a triumphant chariot drawn by such soldiers of his own as were for insolence after victory condemn'd unto this slavish office the fair princess appear'd a wreath of laurel on her head her robes majestical their richness far above all value as the present age contended that a womans pomp should dim the glittering triumphs of the roman caesars
i am cut off no canons throat now thunders nor fife nor drum beat up a charge choise musique ushers the parent of security long absent peace
i know not what to think on't
may it poise the expectation
enter soldiers unarm'd with olive branches captains lorenzo galeazo martino matilda a wreath of laurel on her head in her chariot drawn through them
thus to meet you great duke of tuscany throws amazement on me but to behold my daughter long since mourn'd for and lost even to my hopes thus honour'd by you with an excess of comfort overwhelms me and yet i cannot truly call my self happy in this solemnity till your highness vouchsafe to make me understand the motives that in this peaceful way hath brought you to us
i must crave licence first for know gonzaga i am subject to anothers will and can nor speak nor do without permission from her my curled forehead of late terrible to those that did acknowledge me their lord while lor
speaks uberti and the rest present themselves to matilda
is now as smooth as rivers when no wind stirs my frowns or smiles that kill'd or sav'd have lost their potent awe and sweetness i am transform'd but do not scorn the metamorphosis from that fierce thing men held me i am captiv'd and by the unresistable force of beauty led hither as a prisoner
is't your pleasure that i shall deliver those injunctions which your absolute command impos'd upon me or daign your self to speak 'em
sir i am your property you may use me as you please but what is in your power and breast to do no orator can dilate so well
that i came hither as an enemy with hostile arms to the utter ruine of your country what i have done makes apparent that fortune seconded my will the late defeature will make good that i resolv'd to force the scepter from your hand and make your dukedom tributary my surprizal of mantua your metropolis can well witness and that i cannot fear the change of fate my army flesh'd in blood spoil glory conquest stand ready to maintain yet i must tell you by whom i am subdu'd and what's the ransom i am commanded to lay down
my lord you humble your self too much 'tis fitter you should propose and we consent
forbear the articles are here subscrib'd and sign'd by my obedient hand all prisoners without a ransom set at liberty mantua to be deliver'd up the rampires ruin'd in the assault to be repair'd the loss the husbandman receiv'd his crop burnt up by wanton licence of the soldier to be made good with whatsoever else you could impose on me if you had been the conqueror i your captive
gonz such a change wants an example i must owe this favour to the clemencie of the old heroique valour that spar'd when it had power to kill a vertue buried long since but rais'd out of the grave by you to grace this latter age
mistake not the cause that did produce this good effect if as such you receive it 'twas her beauty wrought first on my rough nature but the vertnes of her fair soul dilated in her converse that did confirm it
mighty sir no more you honor her too much that is not worthy to be vour servant
i have done and now would gladly understand that you allow of the art cles propounded
do not wrong your benefits with such a doubt they are so great and high and with such reverence to be receiv'd that if i should profess i hold my dukedom from you as your vassal or offer'd up my daughter as you please to be dispos'd of in the point of honor and a becoming gratitude 'twould not cancel the bond i stand engag'd for but accept of that which i can pay my all is yours sir nor is there any here though i must grant some have deserv'd much from me for so far i dare presume but will surrender up their interest to that your highness shall daign to pretend a title
i subscribe not to this condition far
the services this prince hath done your grace in your most danger are not to be so slighted
'tis far from me to urge my merits yet i must maintain howe'r my power is less my love is more nor will the gracious princess scorn to acknowledge i have been her humble servant
smooth your brows i'll not incroach upon your right for that were once more to force affection a crime with which should i the second time be tainted i did deserve no favour neither will i make use of what is offer'd by the duke howe'r i thank his goodness i'll lay by my power and though i should not brook a rival what we are well consider'd i'll descend to be a third competitor he that can with love and service best deserve the garland with your consent let him wear it i despair not the trial of my fortune
bravely offer'd and like your self great prince
i must profess i am so taken with it that i know not which way to express my service
did i not build upon the princess grace i could sit down and hold it no dishonor
how i feel my soul divided
all have deserv'd so well i know not where to fix my choice
you have time to consider will you please to take possession of the fort
then having tasted the fruits of peace you may at leisure prove whose plea will ptosper in the court of love

you need not doubt sir were not peace pro∣claim'd and celebrated with a general joy the high displeasure of the mantuan duke rais'd on just grounds not jealous suppositions
the saving of our lives which next to heaven to you alone is proper would force mercy for an offence though capital
when the conqueror uses intreaties they are arm'd commands the vanquish'd must not check at
my piety pay the forfeit if danger come but near you
i have heard my gracious mistress often mention you when i serv'd her as a page and feelingly relate how much the duke her sire repented his hasty doom of banishment in his rage pronounc'd against you
in a private difference i grant that innocence is a wall of brass and scorns the hottest battery but when the cause depends between the prince and subject 'tis an unequal competition justice must lay her ballance by and use her sword for his ends that protects it
i was banish'd and till revoked from exile to tread on my soveraigns territories with forbidden feet the severe letter of the law calls death which i am subject to in coming so neer his court and person
but my onely child being provided for her honor salv'd too i thank your noble change i shall endure whate'r can fall with patience
you have us'd that medicine too long prepare your self for honor in your age and rest secure of't

very pretty may i not be a page
i am old enough well timber'd too and i have a beard to carry it pray you let me be your page i can swear already upon your pantable
that i'll be true unto your smock
hence and pimp to your rams and ews such foul pollution is to be whipt from court i have now no more use of you return to your trough
must i feed on husks before i have plaid the prodigal
no i'll reward your service live in your own element like an honest man all that is mine in the cottage i freely give you
your bottles too that i carry for your own tooth
full as they are
and gold that will replenish 'em
i am made for ever this was done in the nick
why in the nick
o sir 'twas well for me that you did reward my service before you enter'd the court for 'tis reported there is a drink of forgetfulness which once tasted few masters think of their servants who grown old are turn'd off like lame hounds and hunting horses to starve on the commons
there's craft i'the clouted shoo
i am glad to kiss your valiant hand and yours but pray you take notice my title's chang'd i am a colonel
not rais'd yet all the old ones are cashier'd and we are now to have a new militia
all is peace here yet i hold my title still as many do that never saw an enemy
you are pleasant and it becomes you
is the duke stirring
long since four hours at least but yet not ready

be silent and observe
so have you done yet

if your highness please here is a water
my barber hath wash'd my face already
but this water hath a strange vertue in't beyond his art it is a sacred relique part of that most powerful juice which with medea made old aeson young
a fable but suppose i should give credit to it will it work the same effect on me
i'll undertake this will restore the honour'd hair that grows upon your highness head and chin a little inclining unto gray
pardon me mighty sir i went too far not gray at all i dare not flatter you 'tis something chang'd but this apply'd will help it to the first amber colour every hair as fresh as when your manhood in the prime your grace arriv'd at thirty
then here's a pretious oil to which the maker hath not yet given a name will soon fill up these dimples in your face and front
i grant they are terrible to your enemies and set off your frowns with majesty but you may please to know as sure you do a smooth aspect softness and sweetness in the court of love though dumb are the prevailing orators

traitor to great nature in thy presumption to repair what she in her immutable decrees design'd for some few years to grow up and then wither or is't not crime enough thus to betray the secrets of the weaker sex thy patients but thou must make the honor of this age and envy of the time to come matilda whose sacred name i bow to guilty of a future sin in thy ill boding thoughts which for a perpetuity of youth and pleasure she disdains to act such is her purity and innocencce

he's dangerous in these humours
o sir have mercy
in my thought i never offended you
most of all thou monster what a mock man property in thy intent wouldst thou have made me
a meer pathick to thy devilish art had i given suffrage to it
are my gray hairs the ornament of age and held a blessing by the wiseft men and for such warranted by holy writ to be conceal'd as if they were my shame
or plaister up these furrows in my face as if i were a painted bawd or whore
by such base means if that i could ascend to the height of all my hopes their full fruition would not wipe off the scandal
no thou wretch thy cozening water and adulterate oil i thus pour in thine eyes and tread to dust thy loth'd confection with thy trumperies vanish for ever
you have your fee as i take it dear domine doctor
i'll be no sharer with you
i'll court her like my self these rich adorn∣ments and jewels worn by me an absolute prince my order too of which i am the soveraign can meet no ill construction yet 'tis far from my imagination to believe she can be taken with sublimed clay the silk worms spoils or rich embroderies nor must i borrow helps from power or greatness but as a loyal lover plead my cause if i can feelingly express my ardor and make her sensible of the much i suffer in hopes and fears and she vouchsafe to take compassion on me ha
the word sticks in my throat what's here that tels me i do descend too low
rebellious spirit i conjure thee to leave me there is now no contradiction or declining left i must and will go on

parma's prince invited with a too partial report of what i was and might be to him left his country to fight in my defence
your brave atchievements i'the war and what you did for me unspoken because i would not force the sweetness of your modesty to a blush are written here
and that there might be nothing wanting to sum up my numerous engagements never in my hopes to be cancell'd the great duke our mortal enemy when my fathers country lay open to his fury and the spoil of the victorious army and i brought into his power hath shewn himself so noble so full of honor temperance and all vertues that can set off a prince that though i cannot render him that respect i would i am bound in thankfulness to admire him
'tis acknowledg'd and on your part to be return'd
how can i without the brand of foul ingratitude to you and prince uberti
hear me madam and what your servant shall with zeal deliver as a dedalean clew may guide you out of this labyrinth of distraction
he that loves his mistress truly should prefer her honor and peace of mind above the glutting of his ravenous appetite he should affect from her but with a fit restraint and not take her to give himself he should make it the heigth of his ambition if it lie in his stretch'd out nerves to effect it though she flie in an eminent place to add strength to her wings and mount her higher though he fall himself into the bottomless abyss or else the services he offers are not real but counterfeit
what can hortensio infer from this
that i stand bound in duty though in the act i take my last farewell of comfort in this life to sit down willingly and move my suit no further
i confess while you were in danger and heavens mercy made me its instrument to preserve you which your goodness priz'd far above the merit i was bold to feed my starv'd affection with false hopes i might be worthy of you for know madam how mean soever i appear'd in mantua i had in expectation a fortune though not possess'd of't that encourag'd me with confidence to prefer my suit and not to fear the prince uberti as my rival

but when the duke of florence put in his plea in my consideration weighing well what he is as you must grant him a mars of men in arms and those put off the great example for a kingly courtier to imitate annex to these his wealth of such a large extent as other monarchs call him the king of coin and what's above all
his lawful love with all the happiness this life can fancie from him flowing to you the true affection which i have ever borne you does not alone command me to desist but as a faithful councellor to advise you to meet and welcom that felicity which hastes to crown your vertues
we must break off this parley
something i have to say
in tears i thank your care of my advancement but i dare not follow your councel shall such piety pass unrewarded
such a pure affection for any ends of mine be undervalu'd

i will grow here and weeping thus turn marble unless you hear and grant the first petition a virgin and a princess ever tendred nor doth the suit concern poor me alone it hath a strong reference to you and to your honor and if you deny it both ways you suffer
remember sir you were not born only for your self heavens liberal hand design'd you to command a potent nation gave you heroick valour which you have abus'd in making unjust war upon a neighbour prince a christian while the turk whose scourge and terror you should be securely wastes the italian confines 'tis in you to force him to pull in his horned crescents and 'tis expected from you

melt your able nerves that should with your victorious sword make way through the armies of your enemies in loose and wanton dalliance
be your self great sir the thunderbolt of war and scorn to sever two hearts long since united your example may teach the prince uberti to subscribe to that which you allow of
the same tongue that charm'd my sword out of my hand and threw a frozen numness on my active spirit hath dis enchanted me
and that it may appear i do receive your councel as inspir'd from heaven i will obey and follow it i am your debtor and must confess you have lent my weakned reason new strengths once more to hold a full command over my passions
here to the world i freely do profess that i disclaim all interest in you and give up my title such as it is to you sir and as far as i have power thus join your hands
to yours i add my full consent
i am lost farneze
far neerer to the port then you suppose in me our laws speak and forbid this contract
shall we be ever cross'd thus
there is an act upon record confirm'd by your wise predecessors that no heir of mantua as questionless the princess is the undoubted one must be join'd in marriage but where the match may strengthen the estate and safety of the dukedom
now this gentleman however i must stile him honorable and of a high desert having no power to make this good in his alliance stands excluded by our laws whereas this prince of equal merit brings to mantua the power and principality of parma and therefore since the great duke hath let fall his plea there lives no prince that justlier can challenge the princess favor
