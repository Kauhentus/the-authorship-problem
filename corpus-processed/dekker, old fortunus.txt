and a wood in cyprus
enter meanly attired he walks about cracking nuts ere he speaks
so ho ho ho ho
ho ho ho ho
an thou bee'st a good fellow tell me how call'st this wood
ay this wood and which is my best way out
ha ha ha that's true my best way out is my best way out but how that out will come in by this maggot i know not
i see by this we are all worms' meat
well i am very poor and very patient patience is a virtue would i were not virtuous that's to say not poor but full of vice that's to say full of chinks
ha ha so i am for i am so full of chinks that a horse with one eye may look through and through me
i have sighed long and that makes me windy i have fasted long and that makes me chaste marry i have prayed little and that makes me i still dance in this conjuring circle i have wandered long and that makes me weary
but for my weariness anon i'll lie down instead of fasting i'll feed upon nuts and instead of sighing will laugh and be lean sirrah echo
th'art a knave a knave
a knave a knave
ha ha ha ha
ha ha ha ha
why so two fools laugh at one another i at my tittle tattle gammer echo and she at me
shortly there will creep out in print some filthy book of the old hoary wandering knight meaning me would i were that book for then i should be sure to creep out from hence
i should be a good soldier for i traverse my ground rarely marry i see neither enemy nor friends but popinjays and squirrels and apes and owls and daws and wagtails and the spite is that none of these grass eaters can speak my language but this fool that mocks me and swears to have the last word in spite of my teeth ay and she shall have it because she is a woman which kind of cattle are indeed all echo nothing but tongue and are like the great bell of st
michael's in cyprus that keeps most rumbling when men would most sleep
echo a pox on thee for mocking me
fortunatus's native place and which was at one time the chief port and fortress in cyprus
a pox on thee for mocking me
why so snip snap this war is at an end but this wilderness is world without end
to see how travel can transform my teeth are turned into nutcrackers a thousand to one i break out shortly for i am full of nothing but waxen kernels my tongue speaks no language but an almond for a parrot and crack me this nut
if i hop three days more up and down this cage of cuckoos' nests i shall turn wild man sure and be hired to throw squibs among the commonalty upon some terrible day
in the meantime to tell truth here will i lie
are not these comfortable words to a wise man
all hail signor tree by your leave i'll sleep under your leaves
i pray bow to me and i'll bend to you for your back and my brows must i doubt have a game or two at noddy ere i wake again down great heart down
hey ho well well

fortune smiles cry holiday dimples on her cheeks do dwell fortune frowns cry welladay her love is heaven her hate is hell since heaven and hell obey her power
tremble when her eyes do lower since heaven and hell her power obey when she smiles cry holiday
holiday with joy we cry and bend and bend and merrily sing hymns to fortune's deity sing hymns to fortune's deity
let us sing merrily merrily merrily with our song let heaven resound fortune's hands our heads have crowned let us sing merrily merrily merrily
accursed queen of chance what had we done who having sometimes like young phaeton rid in the burnished chariot of the sun and sometimes been thy minions when thy fingers weaved wanton love nets in our curlèd hair and with sweet juggling kisses warmed our cheeks oh how have we offended thy proud eyes that thus we should be spurned and trod upon whilst those infected limbs of the sick world are fixed by thee for stars in that bright sphere wherein our sun like radiance did appear
accursèd queen of chance damned sorceress
most powerful queen of chance dread sovereigness
no more curse on
your cries to me are music and fill the sacred rondure of mine ears with tunes more sweet than moving of the spheres curse on on our celestial brows do sit unnumbered smiles which then leap from their throne when they see peasants dance and monarchs groan
behold you not this globe this golden bowl this toy called world at our imperial feet
this world is fortune's ball wherewith she sports
sometimes i strike it up into the air and then create i emperors and kings sometimes i spurn it at which spurn crawls out that wild beast multitude
curse on you fools 'tis i that tumble princes from their thrones and gild false brows with glittering diadems
'tis i that tread on necks of conquerors and when like demi gods they have been drawn in ivory chariots to the capitol circled about with wonder of all eyes the shouts of every tongue love of all hearts being swoll'n with their own greatness i have pricked the bladder of their pride and made them die as water bubbles without memory
i thrust base cowards into honour's chair whilst the true spirited soldier stands by bare headed and all bare whilst at his scars they scoff that ne'er durst view the face of wars
i set an idiot's cap on virtue's head turn learning out of doors clothe wit in rags and paint ten thousand images of loam in gaudy silken colours
on the backs of mules and asses i make asses ride only for sport to see the apish world worship such beasts with sound idolatry
this fortune does and when this is done she sits and smiles to hear some curse her name and some with adoration crown her fame
fool's cap which virtue wears on her head

old man take heed her smiles will murder thee
old man she'll crown thee with felicity
oh whither am i rapt beyond myself
more violent conflicts fight in every thought than his whose fatal choice troy's downfall wrought
shall i contract myself to wisdom's love
then i lose riches and a wise man poor is like a sacred book that's never read to himself he lives and to all else seems dead
this age thinks better of a gilded fool than of a threadbare saint in wisdom's school
i will be strong then i refuse long life and though mine arm should conquer twenty worlds there's a lean fellow beats all conquerors the greatest strength expires with loss of breath the mightiest in one minute stoop to death
then take long life or health should i do so i might grow ugly and that tedious scroll of months and years much misery may enroll therefore i'll beg for beauty yet i will not that fairest cheek hath oftentimes a soul leprous as sin itself than hell more foul
the wisdom of this world is idiotism strength a weak reed health sickness' enemy and it at length will have the victory
beauty is but a painting and long life is a long journey in december gone tedious and full of tribulation
therefore dread sacred empress make me rich kneels down
my choice is store of gold the rich are wise
he that upon his back rich garments wears is wise though on his head grow midas' ears
gold is the strength the sinews of the world the health the soul the beauty most divine a mask of gold hides all deformities gold is heaven's physic life's restorative oh therefore make me rich not as the wretch that only serves lean banquets to his eye has gold yet starves is famished in his store no let me ever spend be never poor
thy latest words confine thy destiny thou shalt spend ever and be never poor for proof receive this purse with it this virtue still when thou thrust thy hand into the same thou shalt draw forth ten pieces of bright gold current in any realm where then thou breathest if thou canst dribble out the sea by drops then shalt thou want but that can ne'er be done nor this grow empty
the virtue ends when thou and thy sons end
this path leads thee to cyprus get thee hence farewell vain covetous fool thou wilt repent that for the love of dross thou hast despised wisdom's divine embrace she would have borne thee on the rich wings of immortality but now go dwell with cares and quickly die
we dwell with cares yet cannot quickly die
exeunt all singing except fort
but now go dwell with cares and quickly die
if i die to morrow i'll be merry to day if next day i'll be merry to morrow
go dwell with cares
hum ha in what house dwells care that i may choose an honester neighbour
neither there's no care dwells with them but care how to be most gallant
care is afraid sure of a gilt rapier the scent of musk is her prison tobacco chokes her rich attire presseth her to death
princes fair ladies and gallants have amongst you then for this wet eyed wench care dwells with wretches they are wretches that feel want i shall feel none if i be never poor therefore care i cashier you my company
i wonder what blind gossip this minx is that is so prodigal she should be a good one by her open dealing her name's fortune it's no matter what she is so she does as she says
"thou shalt spend ever and be never poor
" mass yet i feel nothing here to make me rich here's no sweet music with her silver sound
try deeper ho god be here ha ha one two three four five six seven eight nine and ten good just ten
it's gold sure it's so heavy try again one two &c
good again just ten and just ten
ha ha ha this is rare a leather mint admirable an indian mine in a lamb's skin miraculous
i'll fill three or four bags full for my sons but keep this for myself
if that lean tawny face tobacconist death that turns all into smoke must turn me so quickly into ashes yet i will not mourn in ashes but in music hey old lad be merry
here's riches wisdom strength health beauty and long life if i die not quickly
sweet purse i kiss thee fortune i adore thee care i despise thee death i defy thee

'sheart why how now two knights of the post
ay master and we are both forsworn as all such wooden knights be for we both took an oath marry it was not corporal you may see by our cheeks that we would not fast twenty four hours to amend and we have tasted no meat since the clock told two dozen
that lacks not much of twenty four but i wonder when that half faced moon of thine will be at the full
the next quarter not this when the sign is in taurus
ho that's to say when thou eat'st bull beef
but shadow what day is to day
what day was yesterday
will to morrow be so too
ay and next day too
that will be rare you slave for a lean diet makes a fat wit
i had rather be a fool and wear a fat pair of cheeks
now i am prouder of this poverty which i know is mine own than a waiting gentlewoman is of a frizzled groatsworth of hair that never grew on her head
sir shadow now we can all three swear like puritans at one bare word this want makes us like good bowlers we are able to rub out and shift in every place
that's not so we have shifted ourselves in no place this three months marry we rub out in every corner but here follows no amendment either of life or of livery
why brother ampedo art thou not yet tired with riding post
come come 'light from this logger headed jade and walk afoot and talk with your poor friends
nay by my troth he is like me if his belly be empty his heart is full
the famine of gold gnaws his covetous stomach more than the want of good victuals thou hast looked very devilishly ever since the good angel left thee come come leave this broad brim fashions because the world frowns upon thee wilt not thou smile upon us
did but the bitterness of mine own fortunes infect my taste i could paint o'er my cheeks with ruddy coloured smiles 'tis not the want of costly diet or desire of gold enforces rupture in my wounded breast
oh no our father if he live doth lie under the iron foot of misery and as a dove gripped in a falcon's claw there pant'th for life being most assured of death
brother for him my soul thus languisheth
'tis not for my old master that i languish
i am not enamoured of this painted idol this strumpet world for her most beauteous looks are poisoned baits hung upon golden hooks when fools do swim in wealth her cynthian beams will wantonly dance on the silver streams but when this squint eyed age sees virtue poor and by a little spark sits shivering begging at all relieved at no man's door she smiles on her as the sun shines on fire to kill that little heat and with her little frown is proud that she can tread poor virtue down therefore her wrinkled brow makes not mine sour her gifts are toys and i desire her power
'tis not the crab tree faced world neither that makes mine sour
well brother virtue we have let slip the ripe plucking of those toys so long that we flourish like apple trees in september which having the falling sickness bear neither fruit nor leaves
nay by my troth master none flourish in these withering times but ancient bearers and trumpeters
shadow when thou provest a substance then the tree of virtue and honesty and such fruit of heaven shall flourish upon earth
true or when the sun shines at midnight or women fly and yet they are light enough
'twas never merry world with us since purses and bags were invented for now men set lime twigs to catch wealth and gold which riseth like the sun out of the east indies to shine upon every one is like a cony taken napping in a pursenet and suffers his glistering yellow face deity to be lapped up in lambskins as if the innocency of those leather prisons should dispense with the cheveril consciences of the iron hearted gaolers
conscience was often called a cheveril conscience
snudges may well be called gaolers for if a poor wretch steal but into a debt of ten pound they lead him straight to execution
doth it not vex thee shadow to stalk up and down cyprus and to meet the outside of a man lapped all in damask his head and beard as white as milk only with conjuring in the snowy circles of the field argent and his nose as red as scarlet only with kissing the ruddy lips of angels and such an image to wear on his thumb three men's livings in the shape of a seal ring whilst my brother virtue here shad
and you his brother vice
most true my little lean iniquity whilst we three if we should starve cannot borrow five shillings of him neither in word nor deed does not this vex thee shadow
not me it vexes me no more to see such a picture than to see an ass laden with riches because i know when he can bear no longer he must leave his burthen to some other beast
art not thou mad to see money on goldsmiths' stalls and none in our purses
it mads not me i thank the destinies
by my poverty and that's but a thread bare oath i am more than mad to see silks and velvets lie crowding together in mercers' shops as in prisons only for fear of the smell of wax they cannot abide to see a man made out of wax for these satin commodities have such smooth consciences that they'll have no man give his word for them or stand bound for their coming forth but vow to lie till they rot in those shop counters except monsieur money bail them
shadow i am out of my little wits to see this
so is not shadow i am out of my wits to see fat gluttons feed all day long whilst i that am lean fast every day i am out of my wits to see our famagosta fools turn half a shop of wares into a suit of gay apparel only to make other idiots laugh and wise men to cry who's the fool now
i am mad to see soldiers beg and cowards brave i am mad to see scholars in the broker's shop and dunces in the mercer's i am mad to see men that have no more fashion in them than poor shadow yet must leap thrice a day into three orders of fashions i am mad to see many things but horn mad that my mouth feels nothing
why now shadow i see thou hast a substance i am glad to see thee thus mad
the sons of fortunatus had not wont thus to repine at others' happiness but fools have always this loose garment wore being poor themselves they wish all others poor
fie brother andelocia hate this madness turn your eyes inward and behold your soul that wants more than your body burnish that with glittering virtue and make idiots grieve to see your beauteous mind in wisdom shine as you at their rich poverty repine
peace good virtue shadow here comes another shadow
it should be a chameleon for he is all in colours
oh 'tis my father
with these tears of joy my love and duty greet your fair return
a double gladness hath refreshed my soul one that you live and one to see your fate looks freshly howsoever poor in state
my father fortunatus and thus brave
'tis no wonder to see a man brave but a wonder how he comes brave
dear andelocia and son ampedo and my poor servant shadow plume your spirits with light winged mirth for fortunatus' hand can now pour golden showers into their laps that sometimes scorned him for his want of gold
boys i am rich and you shall ne'er be poor wear gold spend gold we all in gold will feed now is your father fortunate indeed
father be not angry if i set open the windows of my mind i doubt for all your bragging you'll prove like most of our gallants in famagosta that have a rich outside and a beggarly inside and like mules wear gay trappings and good velvet foot cloths on their backs yet champ on the iron bit of penury i mean want coin
you gild our ears with a talk of gold but i pray dazzle our eyes with the majesty of it
first will i wake your senses with the sound of gold's sweet music tell me what you hear
believe me sir i hear not any thing
'sheart i thought as much if i hear any jingling but of the purse strings that go flip flap flip flap flip flap would i were turned into a flip flap and sold to the butchers
shadow i'll try thine ears hark dost rattle
yes like three blue beans in a blue bladder rattle bladder rattle your purse is like my belly th' one's without money th' other without meat
bid your eyes blame the error of your ears you misbelieving pagans see here's gold ten golden pieces take them ampedo
hold andelocia here are ten for thee
shadow there's one for thee provide thee food
stay boy hold shadow here are ten for thee
then defiance to fortune and a fig for famine
now tell me wags hath my purse gold or no
we the wags have gold father but i think there's not one angel more wagging in this sacred temple
why this is rare shadow five will serve thy turn give me th' other five
nay soft master liberality died long ago
i see some rich beggars are never well but when they be craving my ten ducats are like my ten fingers they will not jeopard a joint for you
i am yours and these are mine if i part from them i shall never have part of them
father if heaven have blest you once again let not an open hand disperse that store which gone life's gone for all tread down the poor
peace ampedo talk not of poverty
disdain my boys to kiss the tawny cheeks of lean necessity make not inquiry how i came rich i am rich let that suffice
there are four leathern bags trussed full of gold those spent i'll fill you more
go lads be gallant shine in the streets of cyprus like two stars and make them bow their knees that once did spurn you for to effect such wonders gold can turn you
brave it in famagosta or elsewhere i'll travel to the turkish emperor and then i'll revel it with prester john or banquet with great cham of tartary and try what frolic court the soldan keeps
i'll leave you presently
tear off these rags glitter my boys like angels that the world may whilst our life in pleasure's circle roams wonder at fortunatus and his sons
according to mandeville who was given sovereignty there and is said by tradition to have had seventy tributary kings
come shadow now we'll feast it royally
do master but take heed of beggary
a wood in cyprus
enter with a gilded face and horns on her head her garments long painted before with silver half moons increasing by little and little till they come to the full while in the midst of them is written in capital letters "~crescit eundo~
" behind her garments are painted with fools' faces and heads and in the midst is written "~ha ha he~
" she and others wearing gilded vizards and attired like devils bring out a fair tree of gold with apples on it
after her comes with a coxcomb on her head and her attire all in white before about the middle is written "~sibi sapit~
" her attire behind is painted with crowns and laurel garlands stuck full of stars held by hands thrust out of bright clouds and among them is written "~dominabitur astris~
" she and other nymphs all in white with coxcombs on their heads bring a tree with green and withered leaves mingled together and with little fruit on it
after her comes with two ~nymphs~ one bearing her wheel another her globe
and last the ~priest~
you ministers of virtue vice and fortune tear off this upper garment of the earth and in her naked bosom stick these trees
how many kingdoms have i measured only to find a climate apt to cherish these withering branches
but no ground can prove so happy ay me none do virtue love
i'll try this soil if here i likewise fade to heaven i'll fly from whence i took my birth and tell the gods i am banished from the earth
virtue i am sworn thy foe if there thou plant here opposite to thine my tree shall flourish and as the running wood bine spreads her arms to choke thy withering boughs in their embrace i'll drive thee from this world were virtue fled vice as an angel should be honourèd
servants of this bright devil and that poor saint apply your task whilst you are labouring to make your pains seem short our priest shall sing
whilst the ~priest~ sings the rest set the trees into the earth
virtue's branches wither virtue pines o pity pity and alack the time vice doth flourish vice in glory shines her gilded boughs above the cedar climb
vice hath golden cheeks o pity pity she in every land doth monarchize
virtue is exiled from every city virtue is a fool vice only wise
o pity pity virtue weeping dies
vice laughs to see her faint alack the time
this sinks with painted wings the other flies alack that best should fall and bad should climb
o pity pity pity mourn not sing vice is a saint virtue an underling
vice doth flourish vice in glory shines virtue's branches wither virtue pines
flourish or wither fortune cares not which in either's fall or height our eminence shines equal to the sun the queen of chance both virtuous souls and vicious doth advance
these shadows of yourselves shall like yourselves strive to make men enamoured of their beauties this grove shall be our temple and henceforth be consecrated to our deities
how few will come and kneel at virtue's shrine
this contents virtue that she is called divine
poor virtue fortune grieves to see thy looks want cunning to entice why hang these leaves as loose as autumn's hair which every wind in mockery blows from his rotten brows
why like a drunkard art thou pointed at
why is this motley scorn set on thy head
why stands thy court wide open but none in it
why are the crystal pavements of thy temple not worn not trod upon
all is for this because thy pride is to wear base attire because thine eyes flame not with amorous fire
virtue is fairest in a poor array
poor fool 'tis not this badge of purity nor sibi sapit painted on thy breast allures mortality to seek thy love
no now the great wheel of thy globe hath run and met this first point of creation
on crutches went this world but yesterday now it lies bed rid and is grown so old that it's grown young for 'tis a child again a childish soul it hath 'tis a mere fool and fools and children are well pleased with toys
so must this world with shows it must be pleased then virtue buy a golden face like vice and hang thy bosom full of silver moons to tell the credulous world as those increase as the bright moon swells in her pearlèd sphere so wealth and pleasures them to heaven shall rear
virtue abhors to wear a borrowed face
why hast thou borrowed then that idiot's hood
fools placed it on my head that knew me not and i am proud to wear the scorn of fools
mourn in that pride and die all the world hates thee
not all i'll wander once more through the world wisdom i know hath with her blessèd wings fled to some bosom if i meet that breast there i'll erect my temple and there rest
fortune nor vice shall then e'er have the power by their loose eyes to entice my paramour
then will i cast off this deformity and shine in glory and triumph to see you conquered at my feet that tread on me
virtue begins to quarrel vice farewell
stay fortune whilst within this grove we dwell if my angelical and saint like form can win some amorous fool to wanton here and taste the fruit of this alluring tree thus shall his saucy brows adornèd be to make us laugh
it will be rare adieu
foul hell bred fiend virtue shall strive with you if any be enamoured of thine eyes their love must needs beget deformities
men are transformed to beasts feasting with sin but if in spite of thee their souls i win to taste this fruit though thou disguise their head their shapes shall be re metamorphosèd
i dare thee do thy worst
my best i'll try
fortune shall judge who wins the sovereignty
the world to the circumference of heaven is as a small point in geometry whose greatness is so little that a less cannot be made into that narrow room your quick imaginations we must charm to turn that world and turned again to part it into large kingdoms and within one moment to carry fortunatus on the wings of active thought many a thousand miles
suppose then since you last beheld him here that you have sailed with him upon the seas and leapt with him upon the asian shores been feasted with him in the tartar's palace and all the courts of each barbarian king from whence being called by some unlucky star for happiness never continues long help me to bring him back to arragon where for his pride riches make all men proud on slight quarrel by a covetous earl fortune's dear minion is imprisonèd
there think you see him sit with folded arms tears dropping down his cheeks his white hairs torn his legs in rusty fetters and his tongue bitterly cursing that his squint eyed soul did not make choice of wisdom's sacred love
fortune to triumph in inconstancy from prison bails him liberty is wild for being set free he like a lusty eagle cut with his vent'rous feathers through the sky and 'lights not till he find the turkish court
thither transport your eyes and there behold him revelling with the emperor of the east from whence through fear for safeguard of his life flying into the arms of ugly night suppose you see him brought to babylon and that the sun clothed all in fire hath rid one quarter of his hot celestial way with the bright morning and that in this instant he and the soldan meet but what they say listen you the talk of kings none dare bewray
the court at babylon
is evidently here confusing egypt with assyria
hence the soldan's court at babylon
enter the ~noblemen~ and sold
art thou that fortunatus whose great name being carried in the chariot of the winds hast filled the courts of all our asian kings with love and envy whose dear presence ties the eyes of admiration to thine eyes
art thou that jove that in a shower of gold appeared'st before the turkish emperor
i am that fortunatus mighty soldan
where is that purse which threw abroad such treasure
i gave it to the turkish soliman a second i bestowed on prester john a third the great tartarian cham received for with these monarchs have i banqueted and rid with them in triumph through their courts in crystal chariots drawn by unicorns
england france spain and wealthy belgia and all the rest of europe's blessed daughters have made my covetous eye rich in th' embrace of their celestial beauties now i come to see the glory of fair babylon
is fortunatus welcome to the soldan
for i am like the sun if jove once chide my gilded brows from amorous heaven i hide
most welcome and most happy are mine arms in circling such an earthly deity but will not fortunatus make me blessed by sight of such a purse
ere i depart the soldan shall receive one at my hands for i must spend some time in framing it and then some time to breathe that virtuous spirit into the heart thereof all which is done by a most sacred inspiration
welcome most welcome to the soldan's court stay here and be the king of babylon stay here i will more amaze thine eyes with wondrous sights than can all asia
behold yon town there stands mine armoury in which are corselets forged of beaten gold to arm ten hundred thousand fighting men whose glittering squadrons when the sun beholds they seem like to ten hundred thousand joves when jove on the proud back of thunder rides trapped all in lightning flames there can i show thee the ball of gold that set all troy on fire there shalt thou see the scarf of cupid's mother snatched from the soft moist ivory of her arm to wrap about adonis' wounded thigh there shalt thou see a wheel of titan's care which dropped from heaven when phaeton fired the world i'll give thee if thou wilt two silver doves composed by magic to divide the air who as they fly shall clap their silver wings and give strange music to the elements i'll give thee else the fan of proserpine which in reward for a sweet thracian song the black browed empress threw to orpheus being come to fetch eurydice from hell
hath ever mortal eye beheld these wonders
thine shall behold them and make choice of any so thou wilt give the soldan such a purse
by fortune's blessèd hand who christened me the mighty soldan shall have such a purse provided i may see these priceless wonders
leave us alone exeunt ~nobles~
never was mortal ear acquainted with the virtue of a jewel which now i'll show out valuing all the rest
behold this casket draws a curtain
fettered in golden chains the lock pure gold the key of solid gold which myself keep and here's the treasure that's contained in it
takes out the hat
a coarse felt hat
is this the precious jewel
i'll not exchange this for ten diadems
on pain of death none listen to our talk
what needs this solemn conjuration
o yes for none shall understand the worth of this inestimable ornament but you and yet not you but that you swear by her white hand that lent you such a name to leave a wondrous purse in babylon
what i have sworn i will not violate but now uncover the virtues of this hat
i think none listen if they do they die
none listen tell what needs this jealousy
you see 'tis poor in show did i want jewels gold could beget them but the wide world's wealth buys not this hat this clapped upon my head i only with a wish am through the air transported in a moment over seas and over lands to any secret place by this i steal to every prince's court and hear their private counsels and prevent all dangers which to babylon are meant by help of this i oft see armies join though when the dreadful alvarado sounds i am distant from the place a thousand leagues
oh had i such a purse and such a hat the soldan were of all most fortunate
oh had i such a hat then were i brave
where's he that made it
dead and the whole world yields not a workman that can frame the like
by what trick shall i make this mine
methinks methinks when you are borne o'er seas and over lands the heaviness thereof should weigh you down drown you or break your neck
in full it would seem to imply "no does it not
no 'tis more light than any hat beside your hand shall peise it
oh 'tis wondrous heavy
fie y'are deceived try it upon your head
would i were now in cyprus with my sons
treason lords treason get me wings i'll fly after this damnèd traitor through the air
who wrongs the mighty king of babylon
this fortunatus this fiend wrongs your king
lock the court gates where is the devil hid
no gates no grates of iron imprison him like a magician breaks he through the clouds bearing my soul with him for that jewel gone i am dead and all is dross in babylon
'tis vain on the wind's wings he'll ride through all the courts of earthly kings
what is the jewel that your grace hath lost
he dies that troubles me call me not king for i'll consume my life in sorrowing
outside the house of enter very gallant and andel
what have i lost to day at dice
more than you will win again in a month
why sir how much comes it to
it comes to nothing sir for you have lost your wits and when a man's wits are lost the man is like twenty pounds' worth of tobacco which mounts into th' air and proves nothing but one thing
and what thing is that you ass
marry sir that he is an ass that melts so much money in smoke
'twere a charitable deed to hang thee a smoking
i should never make good bacon because i am not fat
i'll be sworn thy wit is lean
it's happy i have a lean wit but master you have none for when your money tripped away that went after it and ever since you have been mad
here comes your brother
enter borrow a dram of him if his be not mouldy for men's wits in these days are like the cuckoo bald once a year and that makes motley so dear and fools so good cheap
there's a rattling salutation
you must lend me some more money
nay never look so strange an you will come off so if you will bar me from square play do
come come when the old traveller my father comes home like a young ape full of fantastic tricks or a painted parrot stuck full of outlandish feathers he'll lead the world in a string and then like a hot shot i'll charge and discharge all
i would be loth master to see that day for he leads the world in a string that goes to hanging
take heed i turn not that head into the world and lead you so
ha' ye any ends of gold or silver
thus wanton revelling breeds beggary
brother 'twere better that you still lived poor
want would make wisdom rich but when your coffers swell to the brim then riot sets up sails and like a desperate unskilled mariner drives your unsteady fortunes on the point of wreck inevitable
of all the wealth left by our father when he left us last this little is unspent and this being wasted your riot ends therefore consume it all
i'll live or dying find some burial
thanks for my crowns
shadow i am villainous hungry to hear one of the seven wise masters talk thus emptily
i am a villain master if i am not hungry
because i'll save this gold sirrah shadow we'll feed ourselves with paradoxes
oh rare what meat's that
meat you gull 'tis no meat a dish of paradoxes is a feast of strange opinion 'tis an ordinary that our greatest gallants haunt nowadays because they would be held for statesmen
i shall never fill my belly with opinions
in despite of sway bellies gluttons and sweet mouthed epicures i'll have thee maintain a paradox in commendations of hunger
i shall never have the stomach to do't
see'st thou this crusado
do it and turn this into a feast
but varying in value at different times
covetousness and lechery are two devils they'll tempt a man to wade through deep matters i'll do't though good cheer conspire my death for speaking treason against her
fall to it then with a full mouth
oh famine inspire me with thy miserable reasons
there's no man but loves one of these three beasts a horse a hound or a whore the horse by his goodwill has his head ever in the manger the whore with your ill will has her hand ever in your purse and a hungry dog eats dirty puddings
this is profound forward the conclusion of this now
the conclusion is plain for since all men love one of these three monsters being such terrible eaters therefore all men love hunger
a very lean argument
i can make it no fatter
proceed good shadow this fats me
hunger is made of gunpowder
give fire to that opinion
stand by lest it blow you up
hunger is made of gunpowder or gunpowder of hunger for they both eat through stone walls hunger is a grindstone it sharpens wit hunger is fuller of love than cupid for it makes a man eat himself hunger was the first that ever opened a cook shop cooks the first that ever made sauce sauce being liquorish licks up good meat good meat preserves life hunger therefore preserves life
by my consent thou shouldst still live by hunger
not so hunger makes no man mortal hunger is an excellent physician for he dares kill any body
hunger is one of the seven liberal sciences
which of the seven
music for she'll make a man leap at a crust but as few care for her six sisters so none love to dance after her pipe
hunger master is hungry and covetous therefore the crusado
but hast thou no sharper reasons than this
yes one the dagger of cyprus had never stabbed out such six penny pipes but for hunger
why you dolt these pipes are but in their minority
my belly and my purse have been twenty times at dagger's drawing with parting the little urchins
peace idiot peace my father is returned
touch me not boys i am nothing but air let none speak to me till you have marked me well
now speak your mind
villain why hast thou chalked my father's back
only to mark him and to try what colour air is of
regard him not ampedo andelocia shadow view me am i as you are or am i transformed
i thought travel would turn my father madman or fool
how should you be transformed
i see no change
if your wits be not planet stricken if your brains lie in their right place you are well enough for your body is little mended by your fetching vagaries
methinks father you look as you did only your face is more withered
that's not my fault age is like love it cannot be hid
or like gunpowder a fire or like a fool or like a young novice new come to his lands for all these will show of what house they come
now sir you may amplify
shadow turn thy tongue to a shadow be silent
boys be proud your father hath the whole world in this compass i am all felicity up to the brims
in a minute am i come from babylon i have been this half hour in famagosta
in a minute father
ha ha i see travellers must lie
'tis their destiny the fates do so conspire
i have cut through the air like a falcon i would have it seem strange to you
so it does sir
but 'tis true i would not have you believe it neither
no more we do not sir
but 'tis miraculous and true
desire to see you brought me to cyprus
i'll leave you more gold and go visit more countries
leave us gold enough and we'll make all countries come visit us
the frosty hand of age now nips your blood and strews her snowy flowers upon your head and gives you warning that within few years death needs must marry you those short lived minutes that dribble out your life must needs be spent in peace not travel rest in cyprus then
could you survey ten worlds yet you must die and bitter is the sweet that's reaped thereby
faith father what pleasure have you met by walking your stations
i have revelled with kings danced with queens dallied with ladies worn strange attires seen fantasticos conversed with humorists been ravished with divine raptures of doric lydian and phrygian harmonies
i have spent the day in triumphs and the night in banqueting
oh rare this was heavenly
he that would not be an arabian phoenix to burn in these sweet fires let him live like an owl for the world to wonder at
why brother are not all these vanities
ampedo thy soul is made of lead too dull too ponderous to mount up to the incomprehensible glory that travel lifts men to
my old master's soul is cork and feathers and being so light doth easily mount up
sweeten mine ears good father with some more
when in the warmth of mine own country's arms we yawned like sluggards when this small horizon imprisoned up my body then mine eyes worshipped these clouds as brightest but my boys the glist'ring beams which do abroad appear in other heavens fire is not half so clear
why sir are there other heavens in other countries
peace interrupt him not upon thy life
for still in all the regions i have seen i scorned to crowd among the muddy throng of the rank multitude whose thickened breath like to condensèd fogs do choke that beauty which else would dwell in every kingdom's cheek
no i still boldly stept into their courts for there to live 'tis rare o 'tis divine there shall you see faces angelical there shall you see troops of chaste goddesses whose star like eyes have power might they still shine to make night day and day more crystalline
near these you shall behold great heroes white headed counsellors and jovial spirits standing like fiery cherubims to guard the monarch who in god like glory sits in midst of these as if this deity had with a look created a new world the standers by being the fair workmanship
oh how my soul is rapt to a third heaven
i'll travel sure and live with none but kings
then shadow must die among knaves and yet why so
in a bunch of cards knaves wait upon the kings
when i turn king then shalt thou wait on me
well there's nothing impossible a dog has his day and so have you
but tell me father have you in all courts beheld such glory so majestical in all perfection no way blemishèd
in some courts shall you see ambition sit piercing dedalus' old waxen wings but being clapped on and they about to fly even when their hopes are busied in the clouds they melt against the sun of majesty and down they tumble to destruction for since the heaven's strong arms teach kings to stand angels are placed about their glorious throne to guard it from the strokes of trait'rous hands
by travel boys i have seen all these things
fantastic compliment stalks up and down tricked in outlandish feathers all his words his looks his oaths are all ridiculous all apish childish and italianate
enter in the background after her ~the three destinies~ working
represented as three old women with chaplets made with wool and interwoven with the flowers of the narcissus
they were covered with a white robe and fillet of the same colour bound with chaplets
one of them held a distaff another the spindle and the third was armed with scissors with which she cut the thread which her sisters had spun
i know a medicine for that malady
by travel boys i have seen all these things
and these are sights for none but gods and kings
yes and for christian creatures if they be not blind
in these two hands do i grip all the world
this leather purse and this bald woollen hat make me a monarch
here's my crown and sceptre
in progress will i now go through the world
i'll crack your shoulders boys with bags of gold ere i depart on fortune's wings i ride and now sit in the height of human pride
now fool thou liest where thy proud feet do tread these shall throw down thy cold and breathless head
o sacred deity what sin is done that death's iron fist should wrestle with thy son
thou art no son of fortune but her slave thy cedar hath aspired to his full height
thy sun like glory hath advanced herself into the top of pride's meridian and down amain it comes
from beggary i plumed thee like an ostrich like that ostrich thou hast eaten metals and abused my gifts hast played the ruffian wasted that in riots which as a blessing i bestowed on thee
forgive me i will be more provident
no endless follies follow endless wealth
thou hadst thy fancy i must have thy fate which is to die when th'art most fortunate
this inky thread thy ugly sins have spun black life black death faster
that it were done
oh let me live but till i can redeem
the destinies deny thee longer life
i am but now lifted to happiness
and now i take most pride to cast thee down
hadst thou chosen wisdom this black had been white and death's stern brow could not thy soul affright
give wisdom to my sons
no fool 'tis now too late as death strikes thee so shall their ends sudden and wretched be
jove's daughters righteous destinies make haste
his life hath wasteful been and let it waste
exeunt and ~the three destinies~
why the pox dost thou sweat so
for anger to see any of god's creatures have such filthy faces as these sempsters had that went hence
why you ass they are destinies
indeed if it be one's destiny to have a filthy face i know no remedy but to go masked and cry "woe worth the fates
why droops my father
these are only shadows raised by the malice of some enemy to fright your life o'er which they have no power
i defy their kindred
o ampedo i faint help me my sons
shadow i pray thee run and call more help
if that desperate don dego death hath ta'en up the cudgels once here's never a fencer in cyprus dare take my old master's part
"that great dego of devils
" dekker's non dramatic works
run villain call more help
bid him thank the destinies for this
let me shrink down and die between your arms help comes in vain
no hand can conquer fate this instant is the last of my life's date
this goddess if at least she be a goddess names herself fortune wand'ring in a wood half famished her i met
i have quoth she six gifts to spend upon mortality wisdom strength health beauty long life and riches
out of my bounty one of these is thine
what benefit did from your choice arise
in this small compass lies infinite treasure this she gave to me and gave to this this virtue take quoth she so often as from hence thou draw'st thy hand ten golden pieces of that kingdom's coin where'er thou liv'st which plenteous sure shall last after thy death till thy sons' lives do waste
father your choice was rare the gift divine
it had been so if riches had been mine
but hath this golden virtue never failed
o admirable here's a fire hath power to thaw the very heart of death and give stones life by this most sacred breath see brother here's all india in my hand
inherit you my sons that golden land
this hat i brought away from babylon i robbed the soldan of it 'tis a prize worth twenty empires in this jewel lies
call you this a jewel
it's coarse wool a bald fashion and greasy to the brim i have bought a better felt for a french crown forty times of what virtuous block is this hat i pray
set it upon thy head and wish a wish thou in the moment on the wind's swift wings shalt be transported into any place
a wishing hat and a golden mine
o andelocia ampedo now death sounds his third summons i must hence
these jewels to both i do bequeath divide them not but use them equally never bewray what virtues are in them for if you do much shame much grief much danger follows you
peruse this book farewell
behold in me the rotten strength of proud mortality
his soul is wandering to the elysian shades
the flower that's fresh at noon at sunset fades
brother close you down his eyes because you were his eldest and with them close up your tears whilst i as all younger brothers do shift for myself let us mourn because he's dead but mourn the less because he cannot revive
the honour we can do him is to bury him royally let's about it then for i'll not melt myself to death with scalding sighs nor drop my soul out at mine eyes were my father an emperor
hence hence thou stop'st the tide of my true tears
true grief is dumb though it hath open ears
yet god send my grief a tongue that i may have good utterance for it sob on brother mine whilst you sigh there i'll sit and read what story my father has written here
they both fall asleep and a company of ~satyrs~ enter with music and playing about body take it away
i can get none i can find none where are you master
have i ta'en you napping
i see sorrow's eye lids are made of a dormouse skin they seldom open or of a miser's purse that's always shut
shadow why how now
i can get none sir 'tis impossible
what canst not get
no help for my old master
hast thou been all this while calling for help
yes sir he scorned all famagosta when he was in his huffing and now he lies puffing for wind they say they scorn him
the poison of their scorn infects not him he wants no help
see where he breathless lies brother to what place have you borne his body
i touched it not
nor i a leaden slumber pressed mine eyes
whether it were lead or latten that hasped down those winking casements i know not but i found you both snorting
and in that sleep methought i heard the tunes of sullen passions apt for funerals and saw my father's lifeless body borne by satyrs o i fear that deity hath stolen him hence
that snudge his destiny
i fear he's risen again didst not thou meet him
do you think this white and red durst have kissed my sweet cheeks if they had seen a ghost
but master if the destinies or fortune or the fates or the fairies have stolen him never indict them for the felony for by this means the charges of a tomb is saved and you being his heirs may do as many rich executors do put that money in your purses and give out that he died a beggar
away you rogue my father die a beggar
i'll build a tomb for him of massy gold
methinks master it were better to let the memory of him shine in his own virtues if he had any than in alabaster
i shall mangle that alabaster face you whoreson virtuous vice
he has a marble heart that can mangle a face of alabaster
brother come come mourn not our father is but stepped to agree with charon for his boat hire to elysium
see here's a story of all his travels this book shall come out with a new addition i'll tread after my father's steps i'll go measure the world therefore let's share these jewels take this or this
will you then violate our father's will
keep a dead man's will
indeed in the old time when men were buried in soft church yards that their ghosts might rise it was good but brother now they are imprisoned in strong brick and marble they are fast
fear not away away these are fooleries gulleries trumperies here's this or this or i am gone with both
do you as you please the sin shall not be mine
fools call those things profane that are divine
are you content to wear the jewels by turns
i'll have the purse for a year you the hat and as much gold as you'll ask and when my pursership ends i'll resign and cap you
i am content to bear all discontents
i should serve this bearing ass rarely now if i should load him but i will not
though conscience be like physic seldom used for so it does least hurt yet i'll take a dram of it
this for him and some gold this for me for having this mint about me i shall want no wishing cap
gold is an eagle that can fly to any place and like death that dares enter all places
shadow wilt thou travel with me
i shall never fadge with the humour because i cannot lie
thou dolt we'll visit all the kings' courts in the world
so we may and return dolts home but what shall we learn by travel
sometimes miscalled "fashions" by country farriers
dekker puns on it again in the gull's horn book "fashions then was counted a disease and horses died of it but now thanks to folly it is held the only rare physic and the purest golden asses live upon it
that's a beastly disease methinks it's better staying in your own country
in mine own country like a cage bird and see nothing
yes you may see things enough for what can you see abroad that is not at home
the same sun calls you up in the morning and the same man in the moon lights you to bed at night our fields are as green as theirs in summer and their frosts will nip us more in winter our birds sing as sweetly and our women are as fair in other countries you shall have one drink to you whilst you kiss your hand and duck he'll poison you i confess you shall meet more fools and asses and knaves abroad than at home
yet god be thanked we have pretty store of all
but for punks we put them down
prepare thy spirits for thou shalt go with me
to england shall our stars direct our course thither the prince of cyprus our king's son is gone to see the lovely agripyne
shadow we'll gaze upon that english dame and try what virtue gold has to inflame
first to my brother then away let's fly shadow must be a courtier ere he die
if i must the fates shall be served i have seen many clowns courtiers then why not shadow
fortune i am for thee
the court of enter melancholy with him a ~boy~ after them with a lute
begone leave that with me and leave me to myself if the king ask for me swear to him i am sick and thou shalt not lie pray thee leave me
i am gone sir
this music makes me but more out of tune
gentle friend no more
thou sayest love is a madness hate it then even for the name's sake
o i love that madness even for the name's sake
let me tame this frenzy by telling thee thou art a prisoner here by telling thee she's daughter to a king by telling thee the king of cyprus' son shines like a sun between her looks and thine whilst thou seem'st but a star to agripyne he loves her
if he do why so do gall
love is ambitious and loves majesty
dear friend thou art deceived love's voice doth sing as sweetly in a beggar as a king
dear friend thou art deceived o bid thy soul lift up her intellectual eyes to heaven and in this ample book of wonders read of what celestial mould what sacred essence herself is formed the search whereof will drive sounds musical among the jarring spirits and in sweet tune set that which none inherits
i'll gaze on heaven if agripyne be there if not fa la la sol la &c
o call this madness in see from the windows of every eye derision thrusts out cheeks wrinkled with idiot laughter every finger is like a dart shot from the hand of scorn by which thy name is hurt thine honour torn
laugh they at me sweet galloway
ha ha i laugh at them are not they mad that let my true true sorrow make them glad
i dance and sing only to anger grief that in that anger he might smite life down with his iron fist
good heart it seemeth then they laugh to see grief kill me o fond men you laugh at others' tears when others smile you tear yourselves in pieces vile vile vile
ha ha when i behold a swarm of fools crowding together to be counted wise i laugh because sweet agripyne's not there but weep because she is not anywhere and weep because whether she be or not my love was ever and is still forgot forgot forgot forgot
draw back this stream why should my orleans mourn
look yonder galloway dost thou see that sun
nay good friend stare upon it mark it well ere he be two hours older all that glory is banished heaven and then for grief this sky that's now so jocund will mourn all in black and shall not orleans mourn
o what a savage tyranny it were t'enforce care laugh and woe not shed a tear
dead is my love i am buried in her scorn that is my sunset and shall i not mourn
yes by my troth i will
dear friend forbear beauty like sorrow dwelleth everywhere
rase out this strong idea of her face as fair as hers shineth in any place
thou art a traitor to that white and red which sitting on her cheeks being cupid's throne is my heart's sovereign o when she is dead this wonder beauty shall be found in none
now agripyne's not mine i vow to be in love with nothing but deformity
o fair deformity i muse all eyes are not enamoured of thee thou didst never murder men's hearts or let them pine like wax melting against the sun of destiny thou art a faithful nurse to chastity thy beauty is not like to agripyne's for cares and age and sickness hers deface but thine's eternal
o deformity thy fairness is not like to agripyne's for dead her beauty will no beauty have but thy face looks most lovely in the grave
enter the and gall
see where they come together hand in hand
o watch sweet galloway when their hands do part between them shalt thou find my murdered heart
by this then it seems a thing impossible to know when an english lady loves truly
not so for when her soul steals into her heart and her heart leaps up to her eyes and her eyes drop into her hands then if she say here's my hand
she's your own else never
here's a pair of your prisoners let's try their opinion
my kind prisoners well encountered the prince of cyprus here and myself have been wrangling about a question of love my lord of orleans you look lean and likest a lover whether is it more torment to love a lady and never enjoy her or always to enjoy a lady whom you cannot choose but hate
to hold her ever in mine arms whom i loath in my heart were some plague yet the punishment were no more than to be enjoined to keep poison in my hand yet never to taste it
but say you should be compelled to swallow the poison
then a speedy death would end a speeding misery
but to love a lady and never enjoy her oh it is not death but worse than damnation 'tis hell 'tis agrip
no more no more good orleans nay then i see my prisoner is in love too
methinks soldiers cannot fall into the fashion of love
methinks a soldier is the most faithful lover of all men else for his affection stands not upon compliment
his wooing is plain home spun stuff there's no outlandish thread in it no rhetoric
a soldier casts no figures to get his mistress' heart his love is like his valour in the field when he pays downright blows
true madam but would you receive such payment
no but i mean i love a soldier best for his plain dealing
that's as good as the first
be it so that goodness i like for what lady can abide to love a spruce silken face courtier that stands every morning two or three hours learning how to look by his glass how to speak by his glass how to sigh by his glass how to court his mistress by his glass
i would wish him no other plague but to have a mistress as brittle as glass
and that were as bad as the horn plague
are any lovers possessed with this madness
what madmen are not possessed with this love
yet by my troth we poor women do but smile in our sleeves to see all this foppery yet we all desire to see our lovers attired gallantly to hear them sing sweetly to behold them dance comely and such like
but this apish monkey fashion of effeminate niceness out upon it
oh i hate it worse than to be counted a scold
indeed men are most regarded when they least regard themselves
and women most honoured when they show most mercy to their lovers
but is't not a miserable tyranny to see a lady triumph in the passions of a soul languishing through her cruelty
methinks 'tis more than tyranny
so think not i for as there is no reason to hate any that love us so it were madness to love all that do not hate us women are created beautiful only because men should woo them for 'twere miserable tyranny to enjoin poor women to woo men i would not hear of a woman in love for my father's kingdom
i never heard of any woman that hated love
nor i but we had all rather die than confess we love our glory is to hear men sigh whilst we smile to kill them with a frown to strike them dead with a sharp eye to make you this day wear a feather and to morrow a sick nightcap
oh why this is rare there's a certain deity in this when a lady by the magic of her looks can turn a man into twenty shapes
sweet friend she speaks this but to torture me
i'll teach thee how to plague her love her not
poor orleans how lamentably he looks if he stay he'll make me surely love him for pure pity
i must send him hence for of all sorts of love i hate the french i pray thee sweet prisoner entreat lord longaville to come to me presently
i will and esteem myself more than happy that you will employ me
watch him watch him for god's sake if he sigh not or look not back
he does both but what mystery lies in this
nay no mystery 'tis as plain as cupid's forehead why this is as it should be
"and esteem myself more than happy that you will employ me
" my french prisoner is in love over head and ears
it's wonder how he 'scapes drowning
with whom think you
with his keeper for a good wager ah how glad is he to obey
and how proud am i to command in this empire of affection
over him and such spongy livered youths that lie soaking in love i triumph more with mine eye than ever he did over a soldier with his sword
is't not a gallant victory for me to subdue my father's enemy with a look
prince of cyprus you were best take heed how you encounter an english lady
god bless me from loving any of you if all be so cruel
god bless me from suffering you to love me if you be not so formable
will you command me any service as you have done orleans
no other service but this that as orleans you love me for no other reason but that i may torment you
i will conditionally that in all company i may call you my tormentor
you shall conditionally that you never beg for mercy
come my lord of galloway
exeunt all except the cypr
the ruby coloured portals of her speech were closed by mercy but upon her eye attired in frowns sat murdering cruelty
re enter and listens
she's angry that i durst so high aspire
o she disdains that any stranger's breast should be a temple for her deity she's full of beauty full of bitterness
till now i did not dally with love's fire and when i thought to try his flames indeed i burnt me even to cinders
o my stars why from my native shore did your beams guide me to make me dote on her that doth deride me
hold him in this mind sweet cupid i conjure thee
o what music these hey hos make
i was about to cast my little self into a great love trance for him fearing his heart had been flint but since i see 'tis pure virgin wax he shall melt his bellyful for now i know how to temper him
exit as she departs spies her
yet be my tormentor
i hope she heard me not doubtless she did and now will she insult upon my passions and vex my constant love with mockeries
nay then i'll be mine own physician and outface love and make her think that i mourned thus because i saw her standing by
what news my lord of cornwall
this fair prince one of your countrymen is come to court a lusty gallant brave in cyprus' isle with fifty bard horses prancing at his heels backed by as many strong limbed cypriots all whom he keeps in pay whose offered service our king with arms of gladness hath embraced
born in the isle of cyprus
his servants call him fortunatus' son
enter and with jewels
this he bestowed on me
and this on me
and this his bounteous hand enforced me take
i prize this jewel at a hundred marks yet would he needs bestow this gift on me
my lords whose hand hath been thus prodigal
your countryman my lord a cypriot
the gallant sure is all compact of gold to every lady hath he given rich jewels and sent to every servant in the court twenty fair english angels
my lords prepare yourselves for revelling 'tis the king's pleasure that this day be spent in royal pastimes that this golden lord for so all that behold him christen him may taste the pleasures of our english court
here comes the gallant shining like the sun
enter ~ladies~ and other ~attendants~ also music sounds within
for these your royal favours done to me being a poor stranger my best powers shall prove by acts of worth the soundness of my love
herein your love shall best set out itself by staying with us if our english isle hold any object welcome to your eyes do but make choice and claim it as your prize
the and confer aside
i thank your grace would he durst keep his word i know what i would claim
tush man be bold were she a saint she may be won with gold
'tis strange i must confess but in this pride his father fortunatus if he live consumes his life in cyprus still he spends and still his coffers with abundance swell but how he gets these riches none can tell
the and confer aside
hold him in talk come hither agripyne
but what enticed young andelocia's soul to wander hither
that which did allure my sovereign's son the wonder of the place
this curious heap of wonders which an empress gave him he gave me and by venus' hand the warlike amorato needs would swear he left his country cyprus for my love
if by the sovereign magic of thine eye thou canst enchant his looks to keep the circles of thy fair cheeks be bold to try their charms feed him with hopes and find the royal vein that leads this cypriot to his golden mine
here's music spent in vain lords fall to dancing
my fair tormentor will you lend a hand
i'll try this stranger's cunning in a dance
my cunning is but small yet who'll not prove to shame himself for such a lady's love
these cypriots are the devils that torture me
he courts her and she smiles but i am born to be her beauty's slave and her love's scorn
i shall never have the face to ask the question twice
neither but 'tis the fashion of us cypriots both men and women to yield at first assault and we expect others should do the like
it's a sign that either your women are very black and are glad to be sped or your men very fond and will take no denial
indeed our ladies are not so fair as you
but your men more venturous at a breach than you or else they are all dastardly soldiers
he that fights under these sweet colours and yet turns coward let him be shot to death with the terrible arrows of fair ladies' eyes
nay insultado you must not deny us
mi corazon es muy pesado mi anima muy atormentada
no por los cielos el pie de español no hace musica en tierra ingles
by heaven the spanish foot does not beat to music on english ground
sweet insultado let us see you dance
i have heard the spanish dance is full of state
verdad señor la danza española es muy alta majestica y para monarcas vuestra inglesa baja fantastica y muy humilde
majestic and fit for monarchs your english low fantastic and very humble
doth my spanish prisoner deny to dance
he has sworn to me by the cross of his pure toledo to be my servant by that oath my castilian prisoner i conjure you to show your cunning though all your body be not free i am sure your heels are at liberty
nolo quiero contra deseo vuestro ojo hace conquista á su prisionero oyerer la a pavan española sea vuestra musica y gravidad y majestad paje daime tabacco toma my capa y my espada
mas alta mas alta desviaios desviaios compañeros mas alta mas alta
you shall hear the spanish pavan let your music be grave and majestic page give me tobacco take my cloak and my sword
higher higher make way make way friends higher higher
" the pavan was a stately spanish dance
the spaniard's dance is as his deeds be full of pride
the day grows old and what remains unspent shall be consumed in banquets
agripyne leave us a while if andelocia please go bear our beauteous daughter company
fortune i thank thee now thou smil'st on me
this cypriot bears a gallant princely mind
my lord of what birth is your countryman
think not sweet prince that i propound this question to wrong you in your love to agripyne our favours grace him to another end
nor let the wings of your affection droop because she seems to shun love's gentle lure
believe it on our word her beauty's prize only shall yield a conquest to your eyes
but tell me what's this fortunatus' son
of honourable blood and more renowned in foreign kingdoms whither his proud spirit plumed with ambitious feathers carries him than in his native country but last day the father and the sons were through their riots poor and disdained of all but now they glister more bright than midas if some damnèd fiend fed not his bags this golden pride would end
his pride we'll somewhat tame and curb the head of his rebellious prodigality he hath invited us and all our peers to feast with him to morrow his provision i understand may entertain three kings
but lincoln let our subjects secretly be charged on pain of life that not a man sell any kind of fuel to his servants
this policy shall clip his golden wings and teach his pride what 'tis to strive with kings
withdraw awhile exeunt all except none filled his hands with gold for we set spies to watch who fed his prodigality he hung the marble bosom of our court as thick with glist'ring spangles of pure gold as e'er the spring hath stuck the earth with flowers
unless he melt himself to liquid gold or be some god some devil or can transport a mint about him by enchanted power he cannot rain such showers
with his own hands he threw more wealth about in every street than could be thrust into a chariot
he's a magician sure and to some fiend his soul by infernal covenants has he sold always to swim up to the chin in gold
be what he can be if those doting fires wherein he burns for agripyne's love want power to melt from him this endless mine then like a slave we'll chain him in our tower where tortures shall compel his sweating hands to cast rich heaps into our treasury
music sounding still a curtain being drawn is discovered sleeping in lap she has his purse and she and another lady tie another like it in its place and then rise from him
i have found the sacred spring that never ebbs
leave us exit ~lady~
but i'll not show't your majesty till you have sworn by england's royal crown to let me keep it
by my crown i swear none but fair agripyne the gem shall wear
then is this mine see father here's the fire whose gilded beams still burn this is the sun that ever shines the tree that never dies here grows the garden of hesperides the outside mocks you makes you think 'tis poor but entering it you find eternal store
art sure of this
how didst thou drive it out
fear not his waking yet i made him drink that soporiferous juice which was composed to make the queen my mother relish sleep when her last sickness summoned her to heaven
he sleeps profoundly when his amorous eyes had singed their wings in cupid's wanton flames i set him all on fire and promised love in pride whereof he drew me forth this purse and swore by this he multiplied his gold
i tried and found it true and secretly commanded music with her silver tongue to chime soft lullabies into his soul and whilst my fingers wantoned with his hair t'entice the sleepy juice to charm his eyes in all points was there made a purse like his which counterfeit is hung in place of this
more than a second kingdom hast thou won
leave him that when he wakes he may suspect some else has robbed him come dear agripyne if this strange purse his sacred virtues hold we'll circle england with a wall of gold
music still enter very gallant reading a bill with empty bags in his hand singing
these english occupiers are mad trojans let a man pay them never so much they'll give him nothing but the bag
since my master created me steward over his fifty men and his one and fifty horse i have rid over much business yet never was galled i thank the destinies
o delicate warble o these courtiers are most sweet triumphant creatures
seignior sir monsieur sweet seignior this is the language of the accomplishment
o delicious strings these heavenly wire drawers have stretched my master even out at length yet at length he must wake
wake me not yet my gentle agripyne
one word sir for the billets and i vanish
there's heaven in these times throw the musicians a bounteous largesse of three hundred angels
why sir i have but ten pounds left
where's the princess agripyne
i am not apollo i cannot reveal
was not the princess here when thou cam'st in
here was no princess but my princely self
no in faith sir
where are you hid
where stand you wantoning
have you given me the slip
well 'tis but an amorous trick and so i embrace it my horse shadow how fares my horse
upon the best oats my under steward can buy
i mean are they lusty sprightly gallant wanton fiery
they are as all horses are caterpillars to the commonwealth they are ever munching but sir for these billets and these fagots and bavins
'sheart what billets what fagots
dost make me a woodmonger
no sweet seignior but you have bid the king and his peers to dinner and he has commanded that no woodmonger sell you a stick of wood and that no collier shall cozn you of your measure but must tie up the mouth of their sacks lest their coals kindle your choler
is't true or hast thou learnt of the english gallants to gull
he's a gull that would be taught by such gulls
not a stick of wood
some child of envy has buzzed this stratagem into the king's ear of purpose to disgrace me
i have invited his majesty and though it cost me a million i'll feast him
shadow thou shalt hire a hundred or two of carts with them post to all the grocers in london buy up all the cinnamon cloves nutmegs liquorice and all other spices that have any strong heart and with them make fires to prepare our cookery
ere fortunatus' son look red with shame he'll dress a king's feast in a spicèd flame
this device sir will be somewhat akin to lady pride 'twill ask cost
fetch twenty porters i'll lade all with gold
first master fill these bags
come then hold up
tricks new crotchets madame fortune
dry as an eel skin
shadow take thou my gold out
why sir here's none in
ha let me see o here's a bastard cheek i see now 'tis not mine 'tis counterfeit 'tis so
slave thou hast robbed thy master
not of a penny i have been as true a steward andel
vengeance on thee and on thy stewardship
yet wherefore curse i thee
thy leaden soul had never power to mount up to the knowledge of the rich mystery closed in my purse
oh no i'll curse myself mine eyes i'll curse they have betrayed me i will curse my tongue that hath betrayed me i'll curse agripyne she hath betrayed me
sirens cease to sing your charms have ta'en effect for now i see all your enchantments were to cozen me
what shall i do with this ten pound sir
go buy with it a chain and hang thyself
now think i on my father's prophecy
tell none quoth he the virtue if you do much shame much grief much danger follows you
with tears i credit his divinity
o fingers were you upright justices you would tear out mine eyes
had not they gazed on the frail colour of a painted cheek none had betrayed me henceforth i'll defy all beauty and will call a lovely eye a sun whose scorching beams burn up our joys or turn them black like ethiopians
o women wherefore are you born men's woe why are your faces framed angelical
your hearts of sponges soft and smooth in show but touched with poison they do overflow
had sacred wisdom been my father's fate he had died happy i lived fortunate
shadow bear this to beauteous agripyne with it this message tell her i'll reprove her covetous sin the less because for gold i see that most men's souls too cheap are sold
shall i buy these spices to day or to morrow
ay to morrow thou shalt buy them
to morrow tell the princess i will love her to morrow tell the king i'll banquet him to morrow shadow will i give thee gold to morrow pride goes bare and lust acold
to morrow will the rich man feed the poor and vice to morrow virtue will adore
to morrow beggars shall be crownèd kings this no time morrow's time no sweetness sings i pray thee hence bear that to agripyne
i'll go hence because you send me but i'll go weeping hence for grief that i must turn villain as many do and leave you when you are up to the ears in adversity
she hath robbed me and now i'll play the thief ay steal from hence to cyprus for black shame here through my riots brands my lofty name
i'll sell this pride for help to bear me thither so pride and beggary shall walk together
this world is but a school of villany therefore i'll rob my brother not of gold nor of his virtues virtue none will steal but if i can i'll steal his wishing hat and with that wandering round about the world i'll search all corners to find misery and where she dwells i'll dwell languish and die
gentles if e'er you have beheld the passions the combats of his soul who being a king by some usurping hand hath been deposed from all his royalties even such a soul such eyes such heart swol'n big with sighs and tears the star crossed son of fortunatus wears
his thoughts crowned him a monarch in the morn yet now he's bandied by the seas in scorn from wave to wave his golden treasure's spoil makes him in desperate language to entreat the winds to spend their fury on his life but they being mild in tyranny or scorning to triumph in a wretch's funeral toss him to cyprus
oh what treachery cannot this serpent gold entice us to
he robs his brother of the soldan's prize and having got his wish the wishing hat he does not as he vowed seek misery but hopes by that to win his purse again and in that hope from cyprus is he fled
if your swift thoughts clap on their wonted wings in genoa may you take this fugitive where having cozened many jewellers to england back he comes step but to court and there disguised you find him bargaining for jewels with the beauteous agripyne who wearing at her side the virtuous purse he clasps her in his arms and as a raven griping the tender hearted nightingale so flies he with her wishing in the air to be transported to some wilderness imagine this the place see here they come
since they themselves have tongues mine shall be dumb
enter with the wishing hat on and dragging by the hand
what devil art thou that affright'st me thus haling a princess from her father's court to spoil her in this savage wilderness
indeed the devil and the pick purse should always fly together for they are sworn brothers but madam covetousness i am neither a devil as you call me nor a jeweller as i call myself no nor a juggler yet ere you and i part we'll have some legerdemain together
do you know me
i am betrayed this is the cypriot
forgive me 'twas not i that changed thy purse but athelstane my father send me home and here's thy purse again here are thy jewels and i in satisfaction of all wrongs andel
talk not you of satisfaction this is some recompense that i have you
'tis not the purse i regard put it off and i'll mince it as small as pie meat
hang the purse were that gone i can make another and another and another ay and another 'tis not the purse i care for but the purser you ay you
is't not a shame that a king's daughter a fair lady a lady not for lords but for monarchs should for gold sell her love and when she has her own asking and that there stands nothing between then to cheat your sweetheart
o fie fie a she cony catcher
you must be dealt fondly with
enjoin what pains thou wilt and i'll endure them so thou wilt send me to my father's court
nay god's lid y'are not gone so set your heart at rest for i have set up my rest that except you can run swifter than a hart home you go not
what pains shall i lay upon you
let me see i could serve you now but a slippery touch i could get a young king or two or three of you and then send you home and bid their grandsire king nurse them i could pepper you but i will not
o do not violate my chastity
no why i tell you i am not given to the flesh though i savour in your nose a little of the devil i could run away else and starve you here
if i must die doom me some easier death
or transform you because you love picking into a squirrel and make you pick out a poor living here among the nut trees but i will not neither
what will my gentle andelocia do
oh now you come to your old bias of cogging
i pray thee andelocia let me go send me to england and by heaven i swear thou from all kings on earth my love shalt bear
shall i in faith
in faith in faith thou shalt
hear god a mercy now thou shalt not go
nay do you hear lady
cry not y'are best no nor curse me not
if you think but a crabbed thought of me the spirit that carried you in mine arms through the air will tell me all therefore set your sunday face upon't
since you'll love me i'll love you i'll marry you and lie with you and beget little jugglers marry home you get not
england you'll say is yours but agripyne love me and i will make the whole world thine
i care not for the world thou murd'rest me between my sorrow and the scalding sun i faint and quickly will my life be done my mouth is like a furnace and dry heat drinks up my blood
o god my heart will burst i die unless some moisture quench my thirst
'sheart now i am worse than ere i was before for half the world i would not have her die
here's neither spring nor ditch nor rain nor dew nor bread nor drink my lovely agripyne be comforted see here are apple trees
climb up for god's sake reach me some of them
look up which of these apples likes thee best
this hath a withered face 'tis some sweet fruit
not that my sorrows are too sour already
come hither here are apples like gold
o ay for god's sake gather some of these
ay me would god i were at home again
stand farther lest i chance to fall on thee
oh here be rare apples rare red cheeked apples that cry come kiss me apples hold your peace i'll teach you to cry
o england shall i ne'er behold thee more
agripyne 'tis a most sugared delicious taste in one's mouth but when 'tis down 'tis as bitter as gall
yet gather some of them
oh that a princess should pine for food were i at home again i should disdain to stand thus and complain
here's one apple that grows highest agripyne an' i could reach that i'll come down
fishes with his girdle for it
make haste for the hot sun doth scald my cheeks
the sun kiss thee
hold catch put on my hat i will have yonder highest apple though i die for't
i had not wont be sun burnt wretched me
o england would i were again in thee
'swounds agripyne stay oh i am undone
sweet agripyne if thou hear'st my voice take pity of me and return again
she flies like lightning oh she hears me not
i wish myself into a wilderness and now i shall turn wild here i shall famish here die here cursing die here raving die and thus will wound my breast and rend mine hair
what hills of flint are grown upon my brows
o me two forkèd horns i am turned beast i have abused two blessings wealth and knowledge wealth in my purse and knowledge in my hat by which being borne into the courts of kings i might have seen the wondrous works of jove acquired experience learning wisdom truth but i in wildness tottered out my youth and therefore must turn wild must be a beast an ugly beast my body horns must bear because my soul deformity doth wear
lives none within this wood
if none but i live here thanks heaven
for here none else shall die
lies down and sleeps under the tree
enter the ~priest~ and ~satyrs~ with music playing before fortune
see where my new turned devil has built his hell
virtue who conquers now
the fool is ta'en
sweet tunes wake him again
music sounds awhile and then ceases
vice sits too heavy on his drowsy soul music's sweet concord cannot pierce his ear
sing and amongst your songs mix bitter scorn
those that tear virtue must by vice be torn
virtue stand aside the fool is caught
laugh to see him laugh aloud to wake him folly's nets are wide and neatly wrought mock his horns and laugh to see vice take him
ha ha ha ha ha laugh laugh in scorn who's the fool
the fool he wears a horn
wakens and stands up
virtue stand aside mock him mock him mock him laugh aloud to see him call him fool
error gave him suck now sorrows rock him send the riotous beast to madness' school
ha ha ha ha ha laugh laugh in scorn
the fool he wears a horn
virtue stand aside your school he hates
laugh aloud to see him mock mock mock him
vanity and hell keep open gates he's in and a new nurse despair must rock him
ha ha ha ha ha laugh laugh in scorn fool fool fool fool fool wear still the horn
and hold apples out to laughing grieving
o me what hell is this
fiends tempt me not
thou glorious devil hence
o now i see this fruit is thine thou hast deformèd me idiot avoid thy gifts i loathe to taste
away since i am entered madness' school as good to be a beast as be a fool
away why tempt you me
some powerful grace come and redeem me from this hideous place
to her hath andelocia all his life sworn fealty would'st thou forsake her now
whose blessed tongue names andelocia
hers who attended on by destinies shortened thy father's life and lengthens thine
o sacred queen of chance now shorten mine else let thy deity take off this shame
woo her 'twas she that set it on thy head
she laughs to see me metamorphosèd
woo me and i'll take off this ugly scorn
woo me and i'll clap on another horn
i am beset with anguish shame and death
o bid the fates work fast and stop my breath
no andelocia thou must live to see worse torments for thy follies light on thee
this golden tree which did thine eyes entice was planted here by vice lo here stands vice how often hast thou sued to win her grace
till now i never did behold her face
thou didst behold her at thy father's death when thou in scorn didst violate his will thou didst behold her when thy stretched out arm catched at the highest bough the loftiest vice the fairest apple but the foulest price thou didst behold her when thy liquorish eye fed on the beauty of fair agripyne because th' hadst gold thou thought'st all women thine
when look'st thou off from her
for they whose souls still revel in the nights of vanity on the fair cheeks of vice still fix their eye
because her face doth shine and all her bosom bears silver moons thou wast enamoured of her
but hadst thou upward looked and seen these shames or viewed her round about and in this glass seen idiots' faces heads of devils and hell and read this "ha ha he" this merry story thou wouldst have loathed her where by loving her thou bear'st this face and wear'st this ugly head and if she once can bring thee to this place loud sounds these "ha ha he
" she'll laugh apace
o re transform me to a glorious shape and i will learn how i may love to hate her
i cannot re transform thee woo this woman
wretched is my state when i to find out wisdom to a fool must fly
fool clear thine eyes this is bright aretë this is poor virtue care not how the world doth crown her head the world laughs her to scorn yet virtue knows her worth
run after her she'll give thee these and these crowns and bay garlands honour's victories serve her and she will fetch thee pay from heaven or give thee some bright office in the stars
immortal aretë virtue divine kneels
o smile on me and i will still be thine
smile thou on me and i will still be thine though i am jealous of thy apostasy i'll entertain thee here come taste this tree here's physic for thy sick deformity
tis bitter this fruit i shall ne'er digest
try once again the bitterness soon dies
mine's sweet taste mine
but being down 'tis sour and mine being down has a delicious taste
the path that leads to virtue's court is narrow thorny and up a hill a bitter journey but being gone through you find all heavenly sweets the entrance is all flinty but at th' end to towers of pearl and crystal you ascend
o delicate o sweet ambrosian relish and see my ugliness drops from my brows thanks beauteous aretë o had i now my hat and purse again how i would shine and gild my soul with none but thoughts divine
that shall be tried take fruit from both these trees by help of them win both thy purse and hat i will instruct thee how for on my wings to england shalt thou ride thy virtuous brother is with that shadow who attends on thee in london there i'll set thee presently
but if thou lose our favours once again to taste her sweets those sweets must prove thy bane
vice who shall now be crowned with victory
she that triumphs at last and that must exeunt
the court of enter with and athelst
lincoln how set'st thou her at liberty
no other prison held her but your court there in her chamber hath she hid herself these two days only to shake off that fear which her late violent rapture cast upon her
where hath the beauteous agripyne been
in heaven or hell in or without the world i know not which for as i oft have seen when angry thamesis hath curled her locks a whirlwind come and from her frizzled brows snatch up a handful of those sweaty pearls that stood upon her forehead which awhile being by the boist'rous wind hung in the air at length hath flung them down and raised a storm even with such fury was i wherried up and by such force held prisoner in the clouds and thrown by such a tempest down again
some soul is damned in hell for this black deed
i have the purse safe and anon your grace shall hear the wondrous history at full
tell me tormentor shall fair agripyne without more difference be now christened mine
my choice must be my father's fair consent
then shall thy choice end in this cyprus prince
before the sun shall six times more arise his royal marriage will we solemnise
proclaim this honoured match
come agripyne i am glad th' art here more glad the purse is mine
as they are going in enter and disguised as irish coster mongers
and stay listening to them the rest exeunt
buy any apples feene apples of tamasco feene tamasco peepins peeps feene buy tamasco peepins
fortunatus as published in the dutch andelocia invents the name of damascus or damasco for his apples on the spur of the moment so as to give them an air of rarety the name apparently not being one previously used for any special kind of apple
in an earlier english edition of the story published about however they are otherwise described
it says there "they were brought from jerusalem and were from the holy garden
good my lord montrose call yonder fellows

so this is admirable shadow here end my torments in saint patrick's purgatory but thine shall continue longer
did i not clap on a good false irish face
it became thee rarely
yet that's lamentable that a false face should become any man
thou art a gull tis all the fashion now which fashion because we'll keep step thou abroad let not the world want fools whilst thou art commencing thy knavery there i'll precede dr
dodipoll here that done thou shadow and i will fat ourselves to behold the transformation of these fools go fly
horn book but he means something more opprobrious "masher" as we would say to day a fool of fashion

s'heart here's my brother whom i have abused his presence makes me blush it strikes me dead to think how i am metamorphosèd
feene peepins of tamasco
for shame cast off this mask
wilt thou buy any pips
mock me no longer with idle apparitions many a land have i with weary feet and a sick soul measured to find thee and when thou art found my greatest grief is that thou art not lost
yet lost thou art thy fame thy wealth are lost thy wits are lost and thou hast in their stead with shame and cares and misery crowned thy head
that shadow that pursues thee filled mine ears with sad relation of thy wretchedness where is the purse and where my wishing hat
are you created constable
you stand so much upon interrogatories
the purse is gone let that fret you and the hat is gone let that mad you i run thus through all trades to overtake them if you be quiet follow me and help if not fly from me and hang yourself
wilt thou buy any pippins
oh how i grieve to see him thus transformed
yet from the circles of my jealous eyes he shall not start till he have repossessed those virtuous jewels which found once again more cause they ne'er shall give me to complain their worth shall be consumed in murdering flames and end my grief his riot and our shames
the court of athelstane
enter followed by and with horns then and athelst
in spite of sorcery try once again try once more in contempt of all damned spells
your majesty fights with no mortal power
shame and not conquest hangs upon this strife
o touch me not you add but pain to pain the more you cut the more they grow again
is there no art to conjure down this scorn
i ne'er knew physic yet against the horn
see prince of cyprus thy fair agripyne hath turned her beauty to deformity
then i defy thee love vain hopes adieu you have mocked me long in scorn i'll now mock you
i came to see how the lord longaville was turned into a monster and i find an object which both strikes me dumb and blind
to morrow should have been our marriage morn but now my bride is shame thy bridegroom scorn
tell me yet is there no art no charms no desperate physic for this desperate wound
all means are tried but no means can be found
then england farewell hapless maid thy stars through spiteful influence set our hearts at wars
i am enforced to leave thee and resign my love to grief
all grief to agripyne
adieu i would say more had i a tongue able to help his master mighty king i humbly take my leave to cyprus i my father's son must all such shame defy
so doth not orleans i defy all those that love not agripyne and him defy that dares but love her half so well as o pardon me
i have in sorrow's jail been long tormented long this mangled bosom hath bled and never durst expose her wounds till now till now when at thy beauteous feet i offer love and life
oh cast an eye of mercy on me this deformèd face cannot affright my soul from loving thee
talk not of love good orleans but of hate
what sentence will my love pronounce on me
will orleans then be mad
o gentle gentle friend i am not mad he's mad whose eyes on painted cheeks do doat o galloway such read beauty's book by rote
he's mad that pines for want of a gay flower which fades when grief doth blast or sickness lower which heat doth wither and white age's frost nips dead such fairness when 'tis found 'tis lost
i am not mad for loving agripyne my love looks on her eyes with eyes divine i doat on the rich brightness of her mind that sacred beauty strikes all other blind
o make me happy then since my desires are set a burning by love's purest fires
so thou wilt bear her far from england's sight enjoy thy wishes
lock me in some cave where staring wonder's eye shall not be guilty to my abhorrèd looks and i will die to thee as full of love as misery
i am amazed and mad some speckled soul lies pawned for this in hell without redemption some fiend deludes us all
o unjust fates why do you hide from us this mystery
my lord montrose how long have your brows worn this fashion
these two feather springs of horn
an irish kerne sold me damasco apples some two hours since and like a credulous fool he swearing to me that they had this power to make me strong in body rich in mind i did believe his words tasted his fruit and since have been attired in this disguise
i fear that villain hath beguiled me too
nay before god he has not cozened you you have it soundly
me he made believe one apple of damasco would inspire my thoughts with wisdom and upon my cheeks would cast such beauty that each lady's eye which looked on me should love me presently
desire to look more fair makes me more fool those apples did entice my wandering eye to be enamoured of deformity
this proves that true which oft i have heard in schools those that would seem most wise do turn most fools
here's your best hope none needs to hide his face for hornèd foreheads swarm in every place
enter with disguised as a ~french soldier~
now chester what physicians hast thou found
many my liege but none that have true skill to tame such wild diseases yet here's one a doctor and a frenchman whom report of agripyne's grief hath drawn to court
cure her and england's treasury shall stand as free for thee to use as rain from heaven

draw weapons where's the princess
follow him stay the french doctor stay the doctor there
and others run out and presently re enter
's heart who dare stay him
'tis the devil in likeness of a frenchman of a doctor
look how a rascal kite having swept up a chicken in his claws so flies this hell hound in th' air with agripyne in his arms
mount every man upon his swiftest horse
fly several ways he cannot bear her far
these paths we'll beat
and this way shall be mine
this way my liege i'll ride
and this way i no matter which way to seek misery
i can ride no way to out run my shame
yes longaville let's gallop after too doubtless this doctor was that irish devil that cozened us the medicine which he gave us tasted like his damasco villany
to horse to horse if we can catch this fiend our forkèd shame shall in his heart blood end
o how this mads me that all tongues in scorn which way soe'er i ride cry 'ware the horn
an open space near london a prison and a pair of stocks in the background
enter with and following
o gentle andelocia pity me take off this infamy or take my life
you think then that i am a true doctor indeed that tie up my living in the knots of winding sheets your life
no keep your life but deliver your purse you know the thief's salutation "stand and deliver
" so this is mine and these yours i'll teach you to live by the sweat of other men's brows
and to strive to be fairer than god made her
right shadow therefore vanish you have made me turn juggler and cry "hey pass" but your horns shall not repass
andelocia is a nettle if you touch him gently he'll sting you
or a rose if you pull his sweet stalk he'll prick you
therefore not a word go trudge to your father
sigh not for your purse money may be got by you as well as by the little welshwoman in cyprus that had but one horn in her head you have two and perhaps you shall cast both
as you use me mark those words well "as you use me" nay y'are best fly i'll not endure one word more
yet stay too because you entreat me so gently and that i'll make some amends to your father although i care not for any king in christendom yet hold you take this apple eat it as you go to court and your horns shall play the cowards and fall from you
in london and transferred by dekker with his usual artistic liberty to cyprus
nay away not a word
why dost thou laugh shadow
to see what a horn plague follows covetousness and pride
brother what mysteries lie in all this
tricks ampedo tricks devices and mad hieroglyphics mirth mirth and melody
o there's more music in this than all the gamut airs and sol fa res in the world here's the purse and here's the hat because you shall be sure i'll not start wear you this you know its virtue
if danger beset you fly and away a sort of broken shinned limping legged jades run hobbling to seek us
shadow we'll for all this have one fit of mirth more to make us laugh and be fat
and when we are fat master we'll do as all gluttons do laugh and lie down
hie thee to my chamber make ready my richest attire i'll to court presently
i'll go to court in this attire for apparel is but the shadow of a man but shadow is the substance of his apparel
away away and meet me presently
i had more need to cry away to thee
away away with this wild lunacy away with riots
away with your purity brother y'are an ass
why doth this purse spit out gold but to be spent
why lives a man in this world to dwell in the suburbs of it as you do
away foreign simplicity away are not eyes made to see fair ladies
hearts to love them
tongues to court them and hands to feel them
out you stock you stone you log's end are not legs made to dance and shall mine limp up and down the world after your cloth stocking heels
you have the hat keep it
anon i'll visit your virtuous countenance again adieu
pleasure is my sweet mistress i wear her love in my hat and her soul in my heart i have sworn to be merry and in spite of fortune and the black browed destinies i'll never be sad
go fool in spite of mirth thou shalt be sad
i'll bury half thy pleasures in a grave of hungry flames this fire i did ordain to burn both purse and hat as this doth perish so shall the other count what good and bad they both have wrought the good is to the ill as a small pebble to a mighty hill
thy glory and thy mischiefs here shall burn good gifts abused to man's confusion turn
enter and with ~soldiers~
this is his brother soldiers bind his arms
bind arms and legs and hale the fiend away
uncivil wherefore must i taste your spite
art thou not one of fortunatus' sons
i am but he did never do you wrong
the devil thy brother has villain look here
where is the beauteous purse and wishing hat
my brother andelocia has the purse this way he'll come anon to pass to court
alas that sin should make men's hearts so bold to kill their souls for the base thirst of gold
the wishing hat is burnt
tortures shall wring both hat and purse from you
villain i'll be revenged for that base scorn thy hell hound brother clapped upon my head
and so will longaville
drag him to yonder tower there shackle him and in a pair of stocks lock up his heels and bid your wishing cap deliver you
give us the purse and hat we'll set thee free else rot to death and starve
oh tyranny you need not scorn the badge which you did bear beasts would you be though horns you did not wear
drag hence the cur come noble longaville one's sure and were the other fiend as fast their pride should cost their lives their purse and hat shall both be ours we'll share them equally
that will be some amends for arming me
enter and after him
peace longaville yonder the gallant comes
the king expects your presence at the court
and thither am i going
pips fine fine apples of tamasco ha ha ha
wert thou that irishman that cozened us
pips fine ha ha ha
no not i not shadow
were not your apples delicate and rare
the worst that e'er you sold sirs bind him fast
what will you murder me
help help some help
follow that dog and stop his bawling throat
villains what means this barbarous treachery
we mean to be revenged for our disgrace
and stop the golden current of thy waste
they murder me o call for help
thy voice is spent in vain come come this purse this well spring of your prodigality
are you appointed by the king to this
no no rise spurn him up
know you who's this
alas what fate hath made thy virtues so unfortunate
thy riot and the wrong of these two lords who causeless thus do starve me in this prison
again in his next speech "my want is famine
strive not y'are best villains lift in his legs
traitors to honour what do you intend
that riot shall in wretchedness have end
question thy brother with what cost he's fed and so assure thou shall be banqueted
in want in misery in woe and care poor ampedo his fill hath surfeited my want is famine bolts my misery my care and woe should be thy portion
give me that portion for i have a heart shall spend it freely and make bankrupt the proudest woe that ever wet man's eyes
care with a mischief
wherefore should i care
have i rid side by side by mighty kings yet be thus bridled now
i'll tear these fetters murder
to bear this scorn our fortunes are too proud
o folly thou hast power to make flesh glad when the rich soul in wretchedness is clad
peace fool am i not fortune's minion
these bands are but one wrinkle of her frown this is her evening mask her next morn's eye shall overshine the sun in majesty
but this sad night will make an end of me
brother farewell grief famine sorrow want have made an end of wretched ampedo
where is the wishing hat
accursèd be those hands that did destroy it that would redeem us did we now enjoy it
i faint death's frozen hand congeals life's little river in my breast
no man before his end is truly blest
o miserable miserable soul
thus a foul life makes death to look more foul
re enter and with a halter
thus shall this golden purse divided be one day for you another day for me
of days anon say what determine you shall they have liberty or shall they die
die sure and see i think the elder's dead
ay murderers he is dead
o sacred wisdom had fortunatus been enamourèd of thy celestial beauty his two sons had shined like two bright suns
come you to strangle me
are you the hangman
hell hounds y'are damned for this impiety
i deserve thy hate myself have made myself a reprobate
for i have transgressed against thy laws my vows are quite forgot and therefore shame is fallen to my sin's lot
riches and knowledge are two gifts divine
they that abuse them both as i have done to shame to beggary to hell must run
o conscience hold thy sting cease to afflict me
be quick tormentors i desire to die no death is equal to my misery
cyprus vain world and vanity farewell
who builds his heaven on earth is sure of hell
he's dead in some deep vault let's throw their bodies
first let us see the purse lord longaville
here 'tis by this we'll fill this tower with gold
frenchman this purse is counterfeit
scot thou hast cozened me give me the right else shall thy bosom be my weapon's grave
villain thou shalt not rob me of my due
enter and with weapons at one door and their ~attendants~ at the other
lay hands upon the murderers strike them down
surrender up this purse for this is mine
are these two devils or some powers divine
o see see o my two masters poor shadow's substances what shall i do
whose body shall shadow now follow
peace idiot thou shalt find rich heaps of fools that will be proud to entertain a shadow
i charm thy babbling lips from troubling me
you need not hold them see i smite them down lower than hell base souls sink to your heaven
i do arrest you both my prisoners
stand not amazed you gods of earth at this she that arresteth these two fools is vice they have broke virtue's laws vice is her sergeant her jailer and her executioner
look on those cypriots fortunatus' sons they and their father were my minions my name is fortune
kneel not to me if fortune list to frown you need not fall down for she'll spurn you down arise
but fools on you i'll triumph thus what have you gained by being covetous
this prodigal purse did fortune's bounteous hand bestow on them their riots made them poor and set these marks of miserable death on all their pride the famine of base gold hath made your souls to murder's hands be sold only to be called rich
but idiots see the virtues to be fled fortune hath caused it so those that will all devour must all forego
thy tongue but heaps more vengeance on thy head
fortune is angry with thee in thee burns a greedy covetous fire in agripyne pride like a monarch revels and those sins have led you blind fold to your former shames but virtue pardoned you and so doth fortune
all thanks to both your sacred deities
as for these metal eaters these base thieves who rather than they would be counted poor will dig through hell for gold you were forgiven by virtue's general pardon her broad seal gave you your lives when she took off your horns
yet having scarce one foot out of the jail you tempt damnation by more desperate means you both are mortal and your pains shall ring through both your ears to terrify your souls as please the judgment of this mortal king
fair empress of the world since you resign your power to me this sentence shall be mine thou shall be tortured on a wheel to death thou with wild horses shall be quarterèd
points to and vice
ha ha weak judge weak judgment i reverse that sentence for they are my prisoners
embalm the bodies of those cypriots and honour them with princely burial
for those do as you please but for these two i kiss you both i love you y'are my minions
untie their bands vice doth reprieve you both
i set you free
begone but you in liberty shall find more bondage than in chains fools get you hence both wander with tormented conscience
o horrid judgment that's the hell indeed
come come our death ne'er ends if conscience bleed
o miserable miserable men
fortune triumphs at this yet to appear all like myself that which from those i took king athelstane i will bestow on thee and in it the old virtue i infuse but king take heed how thou my gifts dost use
england shall ne'er be poor if england strive rather by virtue than by wealth to thrive
enter crowned ~nymphs~ and ~kings~ attending on her crowned with olive branches and laurels music sounding
alas good soul she hides her head
what envious tongue said "virtue hides her head
she that will drive thee into banishment
she that hath conquered thee how dar'st thou come thus tricked in gaudy feathers and thus guarded with crownèd kings and muses when thy foe hath trod thus on thee and now triumphs so
see he's her slave for following thee this recompense they have
is ampedo her slave
why that's my glory
the idiot's cap i once wore on my head did figure him those that like him do muffle virtue in clouds and care not how she shine i'll make their glory like to his decline
he made no use of me but like a miser locked up his wealth in rusty bars of sloth his face was beautiful but wore a mask and in the world's eyes seemed a blackamoor so perish they that so keep virtue poor
thou art a fool to strive i am more strong and greater than thyself then virtue fly and hide thy face yield me the victory
is vice higher than virtue
that's my glory the higher that thou art thou art more horrid the world will love me for my comeliness
thine own self loves thyself why on the heads of agripyne montrose and longaville english scot french did vice clap ugly horns but to approve that english french and scot and all the world else kneel and honour vice but in no country virtue is of price
yes in all countries virtue is of price in every kingdom some diviner breast is more enamoured of me than the rest
have english scot and french bowed knees to thee
why that's my glory too for by their shame men will abhor thee and adore my name
fortune thou art too weak vice th'art a fool to fight with me i suffered you awhile t'eclipse my brightness but i now will shine and make you swear your beauty's base to mine
thou art too insolent see here's a court of mortal judges let's by them be tried which of us three shall most be deified
so am not my judge shall be your sacred deity
sat in the audience this direct recognition is kept up to the end of the play
o miserable me i am undone
exit and her train
o stop the horrid monster
fortune who conquers now
virtue i see thou wilt triumph both over her and me
empress of heaven and earth
why do you mock me
kneel not to me to her transfer your eyes there sits the queen of chance i bend my knees lower than yours
dread goddess 'tis most meet that fortune fall down at thy conquering feet
thou sacred empress that command'st the fates forgive what i have to thy handmaid done and at thy chariot wheels fortune shall run and be thy captive and to thee resign all powers which heaven's large patent have made mine
sacred deity o now pronounce who wins the victory and yet that sentence needs not since alone your virtuous presence vice hath overthrown yet to confirm the conquest on your side look but on fortunatus and his sons of all the wealth those gallants did possess only poor shadow is left comfortless their glory's faded and their golden pride
only poor shadow tells how poor they died
all that they had or mortal men can have sends only but a shadow from the grave
virtue alone lives still and lives in you i am a counterfeit you are the true i am a shadow at your feet i fall begging for these and these myself and all
all these that thus do kneel before your eyes are shadows like myself dread nymph it lies in you to make us substances
virtue i am sure you love she wooes you to it
i read a verdict in your sun like eyes and this it is virtue the victory
all loudly cry virtue the victory
for joy of this those self same hymns which you to fortune sung let them be now in virtue's honour rung
virtue smiles cry holiday dimples on her cheeks do dwell virtue frowns cry welladay her love is heaven her hate is hell
since heaven and hell obey her power tremble when her eyes do lower
since heaven and hell her power obey where she smiles cry holiday
holiday with joy we cry and bend and bend and merrily sing hymns to virtue's deity sing hymns to virtue's deity
as they are about to depart enter ~two old men~
nay stay poor pilgrims when i entered first the circle of this bright celestial sphere i wept for joy now i could weep for fear
i fear we all like mortal men shall prove weak not in love but in expressing love
let every one beg once more on his knee one pardon for himself and one for me for i enticed you hither
o dear goddess breathe life in our numbed spirits with one smile and from this cold earth we with lively souls shall rise like men new born and make heaven sound with hymns sung to thy name and prayers that we may once a year so oft enjoy this sight till these young boys change their curled locks to white and when gray wingèd age sits on their heads that so their children may supply their steads and that heaven's great arithmetician who in the scales of number weighs the world may still to forty two add one year more and still add one to one that went before and multiply four tens by many a ten to this i cry amen
good night dear mistress those that wish thee harm thus let them stoop under destruction's arm
