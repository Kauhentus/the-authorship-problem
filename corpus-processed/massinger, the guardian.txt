after twice putting forth to sea his fame shipwrack'd in either and his once known name in two years silence buried perhaps lost i'the general opinion at our cost a zealous sacrifice to neptune made for good success in his uncertain trade our author weighs up anchors and once more forsaking the security of the shore resolves to prove his fortune what 'twill be is not in him or us to prophesie you only can assure us

strange self love in a writer
he would know his errors as you find 'em and bestow his future studies to reform from this what in another might be judg'd amiss
and yet despair not gentlemen though he fear his strengths to please we hope that you shall hear some things so writ as you may truly say he hath not quite forgot to make a play as 'tis with malice rumour'd his intents are fair and though he want the complements of wide mouth'd promisers who still engage before their works are brought upon the stage their parasites to proclaim 'em this last birth deliver'd without noise may yield such mirth as ballanc'd equally will cry down the boast of arrogance and regain his credit lost

do not use that word agen if you do i shall grow young and swinge you soundly i would have you know though i write fifty odd i do not carry an almanack in my bones to predeclare what weather we shall have nor do i kneel in adoration at the spring and fall before my doctor for a dose or two of his restoratives which are things i take it you are familiar with
this is from the purpose
i cannot cut a caper or groan like vou when i have done nor run away so nimbly out of the field
but bring me to a fence school and crack a blade or two for exercise ride a barb'd horse or take a leap after me following my hounds or hawks and by your leave at a gamesom mistress and you shall confess i am in the may of my abilities and you in your december
we are glad you bear your years so well

we desire not to prove your valour
'tis your safest course
but as friends to your fame and reputation come to instruct you your too much indulgence to the exorbitant waste of young caldoro your nephew and your ward hath rendred you but a bad report among wise men in naples
in your opinion but to me that understand my self and them they are hide bounded mony mongers they would have me train up my ward a hopeful youth to keep a merchants book or at the plough and clothe him in canvas or course cotton while i fell his woods grant leases which he must make good when he comes to age or be compell'd to marry with a cast whore and three bastards let him know no more then how to cypher well or do his tricks by the square root grant him no pleasure but coyts and nine pins suffer him to converse with none but clowns and coblers as the turk says poverty old age and aches of all seasons light on such heathenish guardians don
you do worse to the ruine of his state under your favour in feeding his loose riots
he wears rich clothes i do so keeps horses games and wenches 'tis not amiss so it be done with decorum in an heir 'tis ten times more excusable then to be over thrifty
is there ought else that you can charge him with
with what we grieve for and you will not approve
out with it man cam
his rash endeavour without your consent to match himself into a family not gracious with the times
'tis still the better by this means he shall scape court visitants and not be eaten out of house and home in a summer progress

alas sir did i approach you with unchaste desires a sullid reputation were deform'd as it may be i am though many affirm i am something more then handsom
i dare swear it

there are a legion of young cupids at barley break in my breeches
hear me sir though you continue nay increase your scorn only vouchsafe to let me understand what my defects are of which once convinc'd i will hereafter silence my harsh plea and spare your further trouble
i'll tell you and bluntly as my usual man∣ner is though i were a woman hater which i am not but love the sex for my ends take me with you if in my thought i found one taint or blemish in the whole fabrick of your outward features i would give my self the lye
you are a virgin possess'd of all your mother could wish in you your father severino's dire disaster in killing of your uncle which i grieve for in no part taking from you
i repeat it a noble virgin for whose grace and favours th' italian princes might contend as rivals yet unto me a thing far far beneath you
a noted libertine i profess my self in your mind there does appear one fault so gross nay i might say unpardonable at your years if justly you consider it that i cannot as you desire affect you
make me know it i'le soon reform it
would you would keep your word

how like you this
adorio offers to go is staid by caldoro
a well bred gentleman
i am now thinking if ere in the dark or drunk i met his mother
he must have some drops of my blood in him for at his years i was much of his religion
the colts tooth still in your mouth
what means this whispering
you may perceive i seek not to displant you where you desire to grow for further thanks 'tis needless complement
there are some natures which blush to owe a benefit if not receiv'd in corners holding it an impairing to their own worth should they acknowledge it
i am made of other clay and therefore must trench so far on your leisure as to win you to lend a patient ear while i profess before my glory though your scorn calist'e how much i am your servant
my designs are not so urgent but they can dispence with so much time
pray you now observe your nephew
like a school boy that had plaid the truant and went to be breech'd
a new affliction your suit offends as much as his repulse it being not to be granted
hear him madam his sorrow is not personated he deserves your pitty not contempt
he has made the maid his and as the master of the art of love wisely affirms it is a kind of passage to the mistress favour
i come not to urge my merit to deserve you since you are weigh'd truly to your worth above all value much less to argue you of want of judgment for following one that with wing'd feet flies from you while i at all parts without boast his equal in vain pursue you bringing those flames with me those lawful flames for madam know with other i never shall approach you which adorio in scorn of hymen and religious rites with atheistical impudence contemns and in his loose attempt to undermine the fortress of your honor seeks to ruine all holy altars by clear mindes erected to virgin honor
my nephew is an ass what a devil hath he to do with virgin honor altars or lawful flames
when he should tell her they are superstitious nothings and speak to the purpose of the delight to meet in the old dance between a pair of sheets my grandame call'd it the peopling of the world
to vindicate my honor that is needless i dare not fear the worst aspersion malice can throw upon it
your sweet patience lady and more then dove like innocence renders you insensible of an injury for which i deeply suffer
can you undergo the scorn of being refus'd
i must confess it makes for my ends for had he embrac'd your gracious offers tender'd him i had been in my own hopes forsaken and if yet there can breathe any air of comfort in me to his contempt i owe it but his ill no more shall make way for my good intents then vertue powerful in her self can need the aids of vice
you take that licence sir which yet i never granted
i'll force more nor will i for mine own ends undertake it as i will make apparent but to do a justice to your sex with mine own wrong and irrecoverable loss
to thee i turn thou goatish ribaud in whom lust is grown defensible the last descent to hell which gapes wide for thee look upon this lady and on her fame if it were possible fairer then she is and if base desires and beastly appetite will give thee leave consider how she sought thee how this lady in a noble way desir'd thee was she fashion'd in an inimitable mould which nature broke the great work perfected to be made a slave to thy libidinous twines and when commanded to be us'd as physick after drunken surfets
mankind should rise against thee what even now i heard with horror shew'd like blasphemy and as such i will punish it

after a whining prologue who would have look'd for such a rough catastophre
nay come on fear nothing never till now my nephew

if i were i'thy shirt how i could nick it
you stand madam as you were rooted and i more then fear my passion hath offended i perceive the roses frighted from your cheeks and paleness t'usurp their room yet you may please to ascribe it to my excess of love and boundless ardor to do you right for my self i have done nothing
i will not curse my stars howere assur'd to me you are lost for ever for suppose adorio slain and by my hand my life is forfeited to the law which i contemn so with a tear or two you would remember i was your martyr and died in your service
and in my just com∣passion of what you suffer i were more then marble should i not keep you company you have sought my favours nobly and i am justly punish'd in wild adorio's contempt and scorn for my ingratitude it is no better to your deservings yet such is my fate though i would i cannot help it
in our misplac'd affection i prove too soon and with dear bought experience cupid is blind indeed and hath mistook his arrows
if it be possible learn to forget and yet that punishment is too light to hate a thankless virgin practise it and may your due consideration that i am so in your imagination disperse lothsom deformity upon this face that hath bewitch'd you
more i cannot say but that i truly pitty you and wish you a better choice which in my prayers caldoro i ever will remember
'tis a sweet rogue why how now
i am not so happy oh that i were but master of my self you soon should see me nothing
what would you do
with one stab give a fatal period to my woes and life together
better the kind were lost and generation maintain'd a new way
pray you sir forbear this profane language

what's this to me
it shall be and you give thanks for't
in the afternoon for we will have variety of delights we'll to the field agen no game shall rise but we'll be ready for't if a hare my greyhounds shall make a course for the pye or jay a sparhawk flies from the fist the crow so near pursu'd shall be compell'd to seek protection under our horses bellies a hearn put from her siege and a pistol shot off in her breech shall mount so high that to your view she'll seem to soar above the middle region of the air
a cast of haggard falcons by me man'd eying the prey at first appear as if they did turn tayl but with their laboring wings getting above her with a thought their pinions cleaving the purer element make in and by turns binde with her the frighted fowl lying at her defence upon her back with her dreadful beak a while defers her death but by degrees forc'd down we part the fray and feast upon her
this cannot be i grant but pretty pastime dur
'tis royal sport then for an evening flight a tercel gentle which i call my masters as he were sent a messenger to the moon in such a place flies as he seems to say see me or see me not the partridge sprung he makes his stoop but wanting breath is forc'd to cancellior then with such speed as if he carried lightning in his wings he strikes the trembling bird who even in death appears proud to be made his quarry
yet all this is nothing to caliste

i have bred them up to't should their fathers mur∣mure their leases are void for that is a main point in my indentures and when we make our progress there is no entertainment perfect if this last dish be not offer'd

my neighbour knows my manners have been such that i presume i may affirm and boldly in no particular action of my life i can be justly censur'd
what lord or lady lives worthy to sit a competent judge on you
yet black detraction will find faults where they are not
her foul mouth is stopp'd you being the object give me leave to speak my thoughts yet still under correction and if my young lady and her woman here with reverence they may be edifi'd
you are my gracious patroness and supportress and i your poor observer nay your creature fed by your bounties and but that i know your honor detests flattery i might say and with an emphasis you are the lady admir'd and envied at far far above all imitation of the best of women that are or ever shall be
this is truth i dare not be obsequious and 'twould ill become my gravity and wisdom glean'd from your oraculous ladiship to act the part of a she parasite jol

'do not interrupt her 'tis such a pleasing itch to your lady mother that she may peradventure forget us to feed on her own praises
i am not so far in debt to age but if i would listen to mens bewitching sorceries i could be courted
rest secure of that all the braveries of the city run mad for you and yet your vertue's such not one attempts you
i keep no mankind servant in my house in fear my chastity may be suspected how is that voic'd in naples
with loud applause i assure your honor
it confirms i can command my sensual ap∣petites
as vassals to your more then masculine reason that commands 'em your palace stil'd a nunnery of pureness in which not one lascivious thought dares enter your clear soul standing sentinel
yet i have tasted those delights which women so greedily long for know their titillations and when with danger of his head thy father comes to give comfort to my widowed sheets as soon as his desires are satisfied i can with ease forget 'em
observe that it being indeed remarkable 'tis nothing for a simple maid that never had her hand in the hony pot of pleasure to forbear it but such as have lick'd there and lick'd there often and felt the sweetness of't

be you more modest or seek some other mistress rather then in a thought or dream i will consent to ought that may take from my honor i'll endure more then my mother can impose upon me
i grant your honor is a specious dressing but without conversation of men a kinde of nothing i will not perswade you to disobedience yet my confessor told me and he you know is held a learned clerk when parents do enjoyn unnatural things wise children may evade 'em
she may as well command when you are hungry not to eat or drink or sleep and yet all these are easie compar'd with the not seeing of a man as i perswade no farther but to you there is no such necessity you have means to shun your mothers rigor
lawful and pleasing too i will not urge caldoro's loyal love you being averse to't make tryal of adorio

there's no such thing intended madam in few words write to him what slavish hours you spend under your mother that you desire not present marriage from him but as a noble gentleman to redeem you from the tyranny you suffer

i'll be the messenger with any hazard and at my return yeeld you a good accompt of't
'tis a business to be consider'd of
consideration when the converse of your lover is in question is of no moment if she would allow you a dancer in the morning to well breathe you a songster in the afternoon a servant to air you in the evening give you leave to see the theater twice a week to mark how the old actors decay the young sprout up a fitting observation you might bear it but not to see or talk or touch a man abominable

i have eyes no more
for severino's pardon you must excuse me i dare not pardon murther monte
his fact sir ever submitting to your abler judgment merits a fairer name he was provok'd as by unanswerable proofs it is confirm'd by monteclaro's rashness who repining that severino without his consent had married jolante his sole sister it being concleal'd almost for thirteen years though the gentleman at all parts was his equal first challeng'd him and that declin'd he gave him a blow in publick
not to be endur'd but by a slave

i can hear no more this opens an old wound and makes a new one
would it were cicatriz'd waite me
we grant you these are glorious pretences revenge appearing in the shape of valor which wise kings must distinguish
the defence of reputation now made a bawd to murther every trifle falsly stil'd an injury and not to be determin'd but by a bloody duel though this vice hath taken root and growth beyond the mountains as france and in strange fashions her ape england can deerly witness with the loss of more brave spirits then would have stood the shock of the turks army while alphonso lives it shall not here be planted move me no further in this

his words have bewitch'd me and something i must do but what
'tis yet an embrion and how to give it form alas i know not pardon me caliste i am nearest to my self and time will teach me to perfect that which yet is undetermined
enter claudio and severino
you are master of your self yet if i may as a tri'd friend in my love and affection and a servant in my duty speak my thoughts without offence
i'th' way of counsel to you i could alleage and truly that your purpose for naples cover'd with a thin disguise is full of danger
'tis here and every where our forc'd companion the rising and the setting sun beholds us inviron'd with it our whole life a journey ending in certain ruine
yet we should not howev'r besieg'd deli∣ver up our fort of life till it be forc'd
'tis so indeed by wisest men concluded which we should obey as christians but when i consider how different the progress of our actions are from religion nay morality i cannot finde in reason why we should be scrupulous that way onely or like meteors blaze forth prodigious terrors till our stuff be utterly consum'd which once put out would bring security unto our selves and safety unto those we prey upon
o claudio since by this fatal hand the brother of my wife bold monteclaro was left dead in the field and i proscrib'd after my flight by the justice of the king my being hath been but a living death with a continued torture
yet in that you do delude their bloody violence that do pursue your life
while i by rapines live terrible to others as my self what one hour can we challenge as our own unhappy as we are yielding a beam of comfort to us
quiet night that brings rest to the labourer is the outlaws day in which he rises early to do wrong and when his work is ended dares not sleep our time is spent in watches to intrap such as would shun us and to hide our selves from the ministers of justice that would brihg us to the correction of the law
o claudio is this a life to be preserv'd
and at so dear a rate
but why hold i discourse on this sad subject
since it is a burthen we are mark'd to bear and not to be shook off but with our humane frailty
in the change of dangers there is some delight and therefore i am resolv'd for naples
may you meet there all comforts that so fair and chaste a wife as fame proclaims her without parallel can yield to ease your sorrows
i much thank you yet you may spare those wishes which with joy i have prov'd certainties and from their want her excellencies take lustre
ere you go yet some charge unto your squires not to flie out beyond their bounds were not impertinent for though that with a look you can command 'em in your absence they'll be headstrong sever
'tis well thought on i'll touch my horn they know my call blows his horn
and will as soon as heard make in to't from all quarters as the flock to the shepherds whistle
hail soveraign of these woods
we lay our lives at your highness feet
and will confess no king nor laws but what come from your mouth and those we gladly will subscribe to sever
make this good in my absence to my substitute to whom pay all obedience as to my self the breach of this in one particular i will severely punish on your lives remember upon whom with our allowance you may securely prey with such as are exempted from your fury
'twere not amiss if you please to help their memory besides here are some newly initiated
to these read you the articles i must be gone claudio farewell claud
may your return be speedy
silence out with your table books
the cormorant that lives in expectation of a long wish'd for dearth and smiling grindes the faces of the poor you may make spoil of even theft to such is justice
he's in my tables
the grand incloser of the commons for his private profit or delight withal his herds that graze upon't are lawful prize
and we will bring'em in although the devil stood roaring by to guard'em
if a usurer greedy at his own price to make a purchase taking advantage upon bond or morgage from a prodigal pass through our territories i'the way of custom or of tribute to us you may ease him of his burthen
claud builders of iron mills that grub up forests with timber trees for shipping
may we not have a touch at lawyers claud
by no means they may to soon have a gripe at us they are angry hornets not to be jested with
this is not so well claud
the owners of dark shops that vent their wares with perjuries cheating vintners not contented with half in half in their reckonings yet cry out when they finde their ghests want coyn 'tis late and bed time these ransack at your pleasures
how shall we know'em
if they walk on foot by their rat colour'd stockings and shining shooes
if horsmen by short boots and riding furniture of several counties
not one of the list escapes us
but for schollars whose wealth lies in their heads & not their pockets soldiers that have bled in their countries service the rent rack'd farmer needy market folks the sweaty laborer carriers that transport the goods of other men are priviledg'd but above all let none presume to offer violence to women for our king hath sworn who that way's a delinquent without mercy hangs for't by marshal law
and perish all such cullions as repine at his new mo∣narchy

enter monteclaro and calypso
thou art sure mistaken 'tis not possible that i can be the man thou art employ'd too
not you the man
you are the man of men and such another in my ladies eye never to be discover'd
a meer stranger newly arriv'd
still the more probable since ladies as you know affect strange dainties and brought far to 'em
this is not an age in which saints live but women knowing women that understand their summum bonum is variety of pleasures in the touch deriv'd from several nations and if men would be wise by their example
'tis a coupling age
why sir do gallants travel
answer that question but at their return with wonder to the hearers to discourse of the garb and difference in foreign females
as the lusty girle of france the sober german the plump dutch fro the stately dame of spain the roman libertine and spriteful tuscan the merry greek venetian courtesan the english fair companion that learns something from every nation and will flie at all
i say again the difference betwixt these and their own country gamesters
some make that their main end but may i ask without offence to your gravity by what title your lady that invites me to her favors is known in the city
if you were a true born monsieur you would do the business first and ask that after
if you onely truck with her title i shall hardly deserve thanks for my travel she is sir no single duccat trader nor a beldam so frozen up that a fever cannot thaw her
no lioness by her breath
leave these impertinencies and come to the matter
would you woo'd be as forward when you draw for the upshot she is sir a lady a rich fair well complexioned and what is not frequent among venus votaries upon my credit which good men have trusted a sound and wholedom lady and her name is madona jolante
i have heard of her for chastity and beauty the wonder of the age
pray you not too much of chastity fair and free i do subscribe too and so you'll finde her
come y'are a base creature and covering your foul ends with her fair name give me just reason to suspect you have a plot upon my life
nay 'tis a dangerous one pray you beware of't 'tis cunningly contriv'd i plot to bring you a foot with the travel of some forty paces to those delights which a man not made of snow would ride a thousand miles for
you shall be receiv'd at a postern door if you be not cautious by one whose touch would make old nestor yong and cure his hernia
a kiss then ravished from you by such lips as flow with nectar a juicy palm more pretious then the fam'd sibilla's bough to guide you safe through mists of perfumes to a glorious room where jove might feast his juno a dire plot a banquet i'll not mention that is common but i must not forget to make the plot more horrid to you
the retiring bower so furnish'd as might force the persians envy the silver bathing tub the cambrick rubbers th'embroider'd quilt a bed of gossamire and damask roses a meer powder plot to blow you up and last a bed fellow to whose rare entertainment all these are but foils and settings off
no more her breath would warm an euenuch
i knew i should heat you now he begins to glow
i am flesh and blood and i were not man if i should not run the hazard had i no other ends in't i have consider'd your motion matron
my plot sir on your life for which i am deservedly suspected for a base and dangerous woman
fare you well sir i'll be bold to take my leave
mont i will along too
come pardon my suspition i confess my error and eying you better i perceive there's nothing that is ill that can flow from you
i am serious and for proof of it i'll purchase your good opinion
i am gently natur'd and can forget a greater wrong upon such terms of satisfaction
i'll not miss a minute
i shall finde you at your lodging

you are a lover already be a drunkard too and after turn small poet and then you are mad katexikene the madman
such as are safe on shore may smile at tem∣pests but i that am embarqu'd and every minute expect a shipwrack rellish not your mirthe to me it is unseasonable
duraz pleasing viands are made sharp by sick palats
i affect a handsom mistress in my grey beard as well as any boy of you all and on good terms will venture as far i'th' fire so she be willing to entertain me but ere i would dote as you do where there is no flattering hope ever t'enjoy her i would forswear wine and kill this letcherous itch with drinking water or live like a carthusian on poor john then bathe my self night by night in marble dew and use no soap but camphir balls
you may and i must suffer it like a rough surgeon apply these burning costicks to my wounds already gangreen'd when soft unguents would better express an uncle with some feeling of his nephews torments
i shall melt and cannot hold out if he whimper
o that this yong fellow who on my knowledge is able to beat a man should be baffel'd by this blinde imagin'd boy or fear his bird bolts
y'have put your self already to too much trouble in bringing me thus far now if you please with your good wishes leave me to my hard fortunes
i'll forsake my self first
i cannot will not thou shalt have no cause to be weary of my company for i'll be useful and ere i see thee perish dispensing with my dignity and candor i will do something for thee though it savour of the old squire of troy

i must say so or you might blame my want of care
my mother little dreams of my intended flight or that these are my nuptial ornaments
how dully thou repliest
thou dost not envy adorio's noble change or the good fortune that it brings to me
my endeavours that way can answer for me
cal true you have discharged a faithful servants duty and it is by me rewarded like a liberal mistress i speak it not to upbraid you with my bounties though they deserve more thanks and ceremony then you have yet express'd
the miseries which from your happiness i am sure to suffer restrain my forward tongue and gentle madam excuse my weakness though i do appear a little daunted with the heavy burthen i am to undergo when you are safe my dangers like to roaring torrents will gush in upon me yet i would endure your mothers cruelty but how to bear your absence in the very thought confounds me since we were children i have lov'd and serv'd you i willingly learn'd to obey as you grew up to knowledg that you might command me and now to be divorc'd from all my comforts can this be borne with patience
the necessity of my strange fate commands it but i vow by my adorio's love i pitty thee
a cold charity you must do more and help me
is this fit language for a servant
for one that would continue your poor servant and cannot live that day in which she is deni'd to be so can mirtilla sit mourning alone imagining those pleasures which you this blessed hymeneal night enjoy in the embraces of your lord and my lord too in being yours already as such i love and honor him shall a stranger sew you in a sheet to guard that maidenhead you must pretend to keep and 'twill become you
shall another do those bridal offices which time will not permit me to remember and i pine here with envy
pardon me i must and will be pardon'd for my passions are in extreams and use some speedy means that i may go along with you and share in those delights but with becoming distance or by his life which as a saint you swear by i will discover all
thou canst not be so treacherous and cruel in destroying the building thou hast rais'd mirt
pray you do not tempt me for 'tis re∣solv'd
i know not what to think of't
in the discovery of my secrets to her i have made my slave my mistress i must sooth her there's no evasion else
prethee mirtilla be not so violent i am strangely taken with thy affection to me 'twas my purpose to have thee sent for
this very night and i vow deeply i shall be no sooner in the desir'd possession of my lord but by some of his servants i will have thee convey'd unto us
i dare not come clear thy looks for instantly we'll prepare for our departure

hath he not left the city and in fear conceal'd himself for ought i can imagine
what would you more
never think on' till fitter time and place invite you to it

enter jolante with a rich banquet and tapers in a chair behind a curtain
i am full of perplexed thoughts imperious blood thou only art a tyrant judgment reason to whatsoever thy edicts proclaim with vassal fear subscribe against themselves i am yet safe in the port and see before me if i put off a rough tempestuous sea the raging winds of infamy from all quarters assuring my destruction yet my lust swelling the wanton sails my understanding stow'd under hatches like a desperate pilot commands me to urge on my pride my pride self love and over value of my self are justly punish'd i that did deny my daughters youth allow'd and lawful pleasures and would not suffer in her those desires she suck'd in with my milk now in my waning am scorcht and burnt up with libidinous fire that must consume my fame yet still i throw more fuel on it
'tis her voice poor turtle she's now at her devotions praying for her banished mate alas that for my guilt her innocence should suffer
but i do commit a second sin in my deferring the extasie of joy that will transport her beyond herself when she flies to my lips and seals my welcom
good angels guard me
what do i behold
some sudden flash of lightning strike me blind or cleave the center of the earth that i may living find a sepulchre to swallow me and my shame together
guilt and horror confound me in one instant thus surpris'd the subtlety of all wantons though abstracted can shew no seeming colour of excuse to plead in my defence
is this her mourning
the imprison'd vapours of rage and sorrow make an earthquake in me this little world like to a tottering tower not to be underpropp'd yet in my fall i'll crush thee with my ruines
draws a poniard she kneels
good sir hold for my defence unheard you wrong your justice if you proceed to execution and will too late repent it
to move it adds could it receive addition ugliness to the loathsom leprosie that in thy being a strumpet hath already infected every vein and spreads it self over this carrion which would poison vulturs and dogs should they devour it
yet to stamp the seal of reprobation on thy soul i'll hear thy impudent lyes borrow'd from hell and prompted by the devil thy tutor whore then send thee to him
your gorgon looks turn me to stone and a dead palsie seises my silenc'd tongue
o fate that the disease were general in women what a calm should wretched men enjoy
speak and be brief or thou shalt suddenly feel me
be appeas'd sir until i have deliver'd reasons for this solemn preparation
on i hear thee
with patience ask your memory 'twill in∣struct you this very day of the moneth years since you married me
grant it what canst thou urge from this
that day since your proscription sir in the rembrance of it annually the garments of my sorrow laid aside i have with pomp observ'd
the thoughts of my felicity then my misery now were the invited guests imagination teaching me to believe that you were present and a partner in it
this real banquet to feast your fancie fiend could fancie drink off these flagons to my health
or th'idol thought like baal devour these delicates

this loose habit which messalina would not wear put on to fire his lustful eyes
wretch am i grown so weak in thy opinion that it can flatter credulity that these gross tricks may be foisted on me
where the bawd your woman
answer me caliste mirtilla
they are dispos'd of if not murther'd to make all sure and yet methinks your neighbour your whistle agent parasite calypso should be within call when you hem to usher in the close adulterer
what will you do
not kill thee do not hope it i am not so near to reconcilement
this scarf th'intended favor to your stallion now is useful do not strive thus bound expect all studied tortures my assurance not my jealousie thou art false can pour upon thee
in darkness howl thy mischiefs and if rankness of thy imagination can conjure the ribaud glut thy self with him i will cry aim and in another room determine of my vengeance
oh my heart strings
and yet sitting a judge in mine own cause upon my self i could not mitigate the heavy doom my incens'd husband must pronounce upon me
in my intents i am guilty and for them must suffer the same punishment as if i had in fact offended
calypso speaks at the door
bore my eyes out if you prove me faulty i'll but tell my lady what caus'd your stay and instantly present you
will she play at blindman buff madam
upon thy life speak in a lower key calyp
the mysterie of this sweet lady where are you
i'll whisper that into thine ear and then fare∣well for ever
my lord i am in a fever horns upon horns grow on him
could he pick no hour but this to break a bargain almost made up
what shall we do
betray him i'll instantly raise the watch
and so make me for ever infamous
the gentleman the rarest gentleman is at the door shall he lose his labour
since that you must perish will shew a womans spleen in you to fall deservedly give him his answer madam
i have on the sudden in my head a strange whimsie but i will first unbind you
i will supply your place and bound give me your mantle take my night gown send away the gentleman satisfied
i know my lord wants power to hurt you i perhaps may get a kiss by the bargain and all this may prove but some neat love trick if he should grow furious and question me i am resolv'd to put on an obstinate silence
pray you dispatch the gent
his courage may cool
i'll speak with him but if to any base or lustful end may mercy at my last gasp forsake me
i was too rash and have done what i wish undone say he should kill me
i have run my head in a fine nooze and i smell the pickle i am in 'las how i shudder still more and more
would i were a she priapus
stuck up in a garden to fright away the crows so i were out of the house she's at her pleasure whatere she said and i must endure the torture
he comes i cannot pray my fear will kill me
enter severino throwing open the doors violently having a knife
it is a deed of darkness and i need no light to guide me there is something tels me i am too slow pac'd in my wreak and trifle in my revenge
no sigh nor groan to witness her compunction
can guilt sleep and innocence be open ey'd
even now perhaps she dreams of the adulterer and in her fancie hugs him wake thou strumpet and instantly give up unto my vengeance the villain that defiles my bed discover both what and where he is and suddenly that i may bind you face to face then sew you into one sack and from some steep rock hurl you into the sea together do not play with the lightning of my rage break stubborn silence
and answer my demands will it not be
i'll talk no longer thus i mark thee for a common strumpet
thus stab these arms that have stretch'd out themselves to grasp a stranger
this is but an induction i'll draw the curtains of the tragedy hereafter howl on 'tis musick to me
he is gone a kiss and love tricks he hath villainous teeth may sublim'd mercury draw 'em
if all dealers in my profession were paid thus there would be a dearth of cuckolds
i had one my arms my arms
i dare not cry for fear cursed desire of gold how art thou punish'd
till now i never truly knew my self nor by all principles and lectures read in chastities cold school was so instructed as by her contrary
how base and deform'd loose appetite is
as in a few short minutes this stranger hath and feelingly deliver'd
oh that i could recall my bad intentions and be as i was yesterday untainted in my desires as i am still in fact i thank his temperance i could look undanted upon my husbands rage and smile at it so strong the guards and sure defences are of armed innocence but i will endure the penance of my sin the onely means is left to purge it
the day breaks calypso
here madam here jol
hath my lord visited thee
hell take such visits these stab'd arms and loss of my nose you left fast on may give you a rellish what a night i have had of't and what you had suffered had i not supplied your place
i truly grieve for't did not my husband speak to thee
yes i heard him and felt him ecce signum with a mischief
but he knew not me like a true bred spartan fox with silence i endured it he could not get one syllable from me
something may be fashion'd from this invention help me i must be sudden thou art free exchange quick quick now binde me sure and leave me to my fortune
pray you consider the loss of my nose had i been but carted for you though wash'd with mire and chamber ly i had examples to excuse me but my nose my nose dear lady
get off i'll send to thee
if so it may take if it fail i must suffer what ever follows
enter severino with a taper
i have searched in every corner of the house yet finde not my daughter nor her maid nor any print of a mans footing which this wet night would be easily discern'd the ground being soft at his coming in or going out
'tis he and i am within hearing heaven forgive this feigning i being forc'd to't to preserve my life to be better spent hereafter
i begin to stagger and my love if it knew how her piety heretofore and same remembred would plead in her excuse
you blessed guardians of matrimonial faith and just revengers of such as do in fact offend against your sacred rites and ceremonies by all titles and holy attributes you do vouchsafe to be invok'd look down with saving pitty upon my matchless sufferings
at her devotions affliction makes her re∣pent
look down upon a wretched woman and as i have kept the knot of wedlock in the temple by the priest fasten'd firm though in loose wishes i yield i have offended to strike blind the eyes of jealousie that see a crime i never yet committed and to free me from the unjust suspition of my lord restore my martyr'd face and wounded arms to their late strength and beauty
does she hope to be cur'd by miracle
this minute i perceive with joy my orisons heard and granted you ministers of mercy who unseen and by a supernatural means have done this work of heavenly charity be ever canoniz'd for't
i did not dream i heard her and i have eyes too they cannot deceive me
if i have no belief in their assurance i must turn sceptick
this is the hand
and this the fatal instrument
these drops of blood that gush'd forth from her face and arms still fresh upon the floor this is something more then wonder or amazement i profess i am a∣stonish'd jol
be incredulous still and go on in your barbarous rage led to it by your false guide suspition have no faith in my so long try'd loyalty nor believe that which you see and for your satisfaction my doubted innocence cleared by miracle proceed these veins have now new blood if you resolve to let it out
i would not be fool'd with easiness of belief and faintly give aside
credit to this strange wonder
'tis now thought on in a fitter place and time i'll sound this fur∣ther
how can i expect my sin
or hope though now i write my self thy slave the service of my whole life can win thee to pronounce despair'd of pardon
that's poor thy mercy must urge more in my defence then i can fancy wil't thou have revenge
my heart lies open to thee
this is needless to me who in the duty of a wife know i must suffer
thou art made up of goodness and from my confidence that i am alone the object of thy pleasures until death divorce us we will know no separation without inquiring why as sure thou wilt not such is thy meek obedience thy jewels and choicest ornaments pack'd up thou shalt along with me and as a queen be honor'd
by such a stile me soveraign already my banishment is repeal'd thou being present the neapolitan court a place of exile when thou art absent my stay here is mortal of which thou art to sensible i perceive it

had i still pin'd away and lingred under the modesty of just and honest hopes after a long consumption sleep and death to me had been the same but now as 'twere possess'd of all my wishes in a moment to have 'em ravished from me
suffer shipwrack in view of the port
and like a half starv'd begger no sooner in compassion cloath'd but coffin'd
malevolent destinies too cunning in wretched caldoro's tortures
o caliste if thy immortal part hath not already left this fair pallace let a beam of light dawn from thine eye in this cimmerian darkness to guide my shaking hand to touch the anchor of hope in thy recovery
she lives disturb her not she is no right bred woman if she die with one fall some of my acquaintance have took a thousand merrily and are still excellent wrestlers at the close hug
prethee be not angry i should speak thus if my mother were in her place
but had you heard the musick of the language which she us'd to me believ'd adorio as she rode behinde me little thinking that she did embrace caldoro
leave talking i conceive it
and rais'd like you from death to life to hear you
hear my defence then ere i take my vail off
a simple maids defence which looking on you i faintly could deliver willingly i am become your prize and therefore use your victory nobly heavens bright eye the sun draws up the grossest vapors and i hope i ne'er shall prove an envious cloud to darken the splendor of your merits
i could urge with what disdain nay scorn i have declin'd the shadows of insinuating pleasures tender'd by all men else you onely being the object of my hopes that cruel prince to whom the olive branch of peace is offer'd is not a conqueror but a bloody tyrant if he refuse it nor should you wish a triumph because caliste's humble i have said and now expect your sentence
what a throng of clients would be in the court of love were there many such she advocates art thou dumb
canst thou say nothing for thy self
dear lady open your eyes and look upon the man the man you have elected for your judge kneeling to you for mercy
i should know this voice and something more then fear i am deceiv'd but now i look upon his face i am assur'd i am wretched
hold her up she'll fall agen before her time else the youth's a well timbred youth look on his ma∣king his hair curl'd naturally he's whole chested too and will do his work as well and go through stitch with't as any adorio in the world my slate on't a chicken of the right kinde and if he prove not a cock of the game cuckold him first and after make a capon of him
i'll cry out a rape if thou unhand me not would i had died in my late trance and never liv'd to know i am betray'd
to a yong and active husband call you that trechery there are a shole of yong wenches i'th' city would vow a pilgrimage beyond jerusalem to be so cheated
to her agen you milk sop violent storms are soon blown over
how could'st thou caldoro with such a frontless impudence arm thy hopes so far as to believe i might consent to this leud practise
have i not often told thee how ere i pitied thy misplaced affection i could not answer it
and that there was a strong antipathy between our passions not to be reconcil'd
vouchsafe to hear me with an impartial ear and it will take from the rigor of your censure
man was mark'd a friend in his creation to himself and may with fit ambition conceive the greatest blessings and the highest honors appointed for him if he can atchieve'em the right and noble way i grant you were the end of my design but still pursu'd with a becoming modesty heaven at length being pleas'd and not my arts to further it
now he comes to her on boy
i have serv'd you with a religious zeal and borne the burthen of your neglect if i may call it so beyond the patience of a man to prove this
i have seen those eyes with pleasant glances play upon adorio's like phoebe's shine guilding a chrystal river and your lip rise up in civil courtship to meet his while i bit mine with envy yet these favors how ere my passions rag'd could not provoke me to one act of rebellion against my loyalty to you the soveraign to whom i ow obedience
my blushes confefs this for a truth
a flag of truce is hung out in this acknowledgment
i could adde but that you may interpret what i speak the malice of a rival rather then my due respect to your deserts
how faintly adorio hath return'd thanks to the bounty of your affection ascribing it as a tribute to his worth and not in you an act of mercy could he else invited as by your words i understood to take you to his protection grosly neglect so gratious an offer
or give power to fate it self to cross him
o dear madam we are all the balls of time toss'd to and fro from the plough unto the throne and back agen under the swinge of destinie mankinde suffers and it appears by an unchang'd decree you were appointed mine wise nature always aiming at due proportion and if so i may believe with confidence heaven in pity of my sincere affection and long patience directed you by a most blessed error to your vow'd servants bosom
by my holidame tickling philosophy
i am sir too weak to argue with you but my stars have better i hope provided for me
if there be disparity between us 'tis in your compassion to level it
give fire to the mine and blow her up
i am sensible of what you have endured but on the sudden with my unusual travel and late bruise i am exceeding weary in you grove while i repose my self be you my guard my spirits with some little rest reviv'd we will consider further for my part you shall receive modest and gentle answers to your demands though short perhaps to make you full satisfaction
i am exalted in the employment sleep se∣cure i'll be your vigilant sentinel
but i command you and as you hope for future grace obey me presume not with one stoln kiss to disturb the quiet of my slumbers let your temperance and not your lust watch over me
my desires are frozen till your pitty shall dissolve'em
think not of frost fool in the dog days remember the old adage and make use of't occasion's bald behinde
is this your uncle
and guardian madam at your better leisure when i have deserv'd it you may give him thanks for his many favours to me
he appears a pleasant gentleman

innocence is free and open

how was this contriv'd
who help'd thee in the plot
were not caliste's aydes in't

didst thou treat with me for thy mistriss favors to make sale of thine own
with her and you i have dealt faithfully you had her letter with the jewel i presented she receiv'd your courteous answer and prepar'd herself to be remov'd by you and howsoever you take delight to hear what you have done from my simplicity and make my weakness the subject of your mirth as it suits well with my condition i know you have her in your possession
has she left her mothers house
you drive this nail too far indeed she deeply vow'd at her departure to send some of your lordships servants for me though you were pleas'd to take the pains your self that i might still be near her as a shadow to follow her the substance
she is gone then
this is too much but good my lord for∣give me i come a virgin hither to attend my noble mistress though i must confess i look with sore eyes upon her good fortune and wish it were mine own ador
then as it seems you do yourself affect me
should she hear me and in her sudden fury kill me for't i durst not sir deny it since you are a man so form'd that not poor i alone but all our sex like me i think stand bound to be enamour'd of you
how justly am i punish'd
in thee punish'd for my defended wantonness
i that scorn'd the mistress when she sought me now i would upon my knees receive her am become a prey unto her bondwoman my honor too neglected for this purchase
art thou one of those ambitious serving women who contemning th'embraces of their equals aim to be the wrong way ladifi'd by a lord
was there no sorward page or footman in the city to do the feat that in thy lust i am chosen to be the executioner
dar'st thou hope i can descend so low
great lords sometimes for change leave calvert sammon and eat sprats in modesty i dare speak no more
if 'twere a fish day though you like it not i could say i have a stomach and would content my self with this pretty whiting mop
discover yet how thou cam'st to my hands
my lady gone fear of her mothers rage she being found absent mov'd me to flie and quitting of the house you were pleas'd unask'd to comfort me i us'd no sorceries to bewitch you then vouchsaf'd thanks ever to the darkness of the night to hug me in your arms and i had wrong'd my breeding near the court had i refus'd it
this is still more bitter canst thou ghess to whom thy lady did commit herself
they were horsemen as you are
in the name of wonder how could they pass the port where you expected my coming
now i think upon't there came three mounted by and behind one a woman embracing fast the man that rode before her
i knew the men but she was vail'd
the first the lord durazzo and the second your rival yong caldoro it was he that carried the wench behinde him
the last a servant that spur'd fast after 'em ador
too much assurance of her love undid me why did you not stay 'em
we had no such commission
or say we had
who durst lay fingers on the angry old russian
for my part i had rather take a baited bull by the horns

your pardon for this my gracious lord binds me to be more circumspect hereafter
look you be so monsieur laval you were a suiter to me for severino's pardon
i was so my good lord
you might have met him here to have thank'd you for't as now i understand
so it is rumour'd and hearing in the city of his boldness i would not say contempt of your decrees as then i pleaded mercy under pardon i now as much admire the slowness of your justice though it force you to some trouble in fetching him in
i have consider'd it
he hath of late as 'tis suspected done an outrage on his wife forgetting nature to his own daughter in whom sir i have some nearer interest then i stand bound to in my humanity which i gladly would make known unto your highness

revive not a sorrow long since dead and so diminish the full fruition of those joys which now i stand possess'd of womanish fear of danger that may pursue us i shake off and with a masculine spirit
in you sir i live and when or by the course of nature or violence you must fall the end of my devotions is that one and the same hour may make us fit for heaven
i join with you in my votes that way but how jolante you that have spent your past days slembring in the doun of quiet can endure the hardness and rough condition of our present being does much disturb me
these woods severino shall more then seem to me a populous city you being present here are no allurements to tempt my frailty nor the conversation of such whose choice behaviour or discourse may nourish iealous thoughts
true jolante nor shall suspected chastity stand in need here to be clear'd by miracle

i am better arm'd then you suppose besides it is confirm'd by all that have been robb'd since severino commanded these banditi though it be unusual in italy imitating the courteous english theeves for so they call 'em they have not done one murther i must adde too that from a strange relation i have heard of severino's justice in disposing the preys brought in i would be an eye witness of what i take up now but on report and therefore 'tis my pleasure that we should as soon as they encounter us without a shew of opposition yield

there's a thousand crowns my vintage harvest profits arising from my herds bound in one bag share it among you

may be he would buy his pasport up to heaven and then this too little though in the journey it were a good viaticum
i would make it a means to help me thither not to wrong you with tedious expectation i'll discover what my wants are and yield my reasons for 'em i have two sons twins the true images of what i was at their years never father had fairer or more promising hopes in his posterity but alas these sons ambitious of glittering honor and an after name atchiev'd by glorious and yet pious actions for such were their intentions put to sea they had a well rigg'd bottom fully mann'd an old experienc'd master lusty sailers stout land men and what's something more then rare they did agree had one design and that was in charity to redeem the christian slaves chain'd to the turkish servitude
a most heroique enterprise i languish to hear how they succeeded
prosperously at first and to their wishes divers gallies they boarded and some strong forts near the shore they suddenly surpriz'd a thousand captives redeem'd from th'oar paid their glad vows & prayrs for their deliverance their ends acquir'd and making homeward in triumphant manner for sure the cause deserv'd it
pray you end here the best i fear is told and that which follows must conclude ill
your fears are true and yet i must with grief relate it prodigal fame in every place with her loud trump proclaiming the greatness of the action the pyrates of tunis and argiers laid wait for 'em at their return to tell you what resistance they made and how my poor sons fought would but increase my sorrow and perhaps grieve you to hear it passionately describ'd unto you in brief they were taken and for the great loss the enemy did sustain their victory being with much blood bought they do endure the heaviest captivity wretched men did ever suffer o my sons

will not these heaps of gold added to thine suffice for ransome
for my sons it would but they refuse their liberty if all that were engaged with them have not their irons with theirs struck off and set at liberty with them which these heaps cannot purchase

but when the holy oyl was pour'd upon my head and i anointed king i swore never to pardon murther i could wink at your robberies though our laws call 'em death but to dispense with monteclaro's blood would ill become a king in him i lost a worthy subject and must take from you a strict accompt of't 'tis in vain to move my doom's irrevocable

i sign all concord here but must to you sir for reparation of my wounded honor the justice of the king consenting to it denounce a lawful war
this in our presence ador
the cause dread sir commands it though your edicts call private combats murthers rather then sit down with a disgrace arising from a blow the bonds of my obedience shook of ill right my self
i do confess the wrong forgetting the occasion and desire remission from you and upon such terms as by his sacred majesty shall be judged equal on both parts

book between juno and hymen
book juno to the bride
enter a maid but made a bride be bold and freely taste
the marriage banquet ne'er deny'd to such as sit down chaste

hymen to the bridegroom
hail bridegroom hail thy choice thus made
as thou wouldst have her true thou must give o'r thy wanton trade and bid loose fires adieu that husband who would have his wife to him continue chaste in her embraces spends his life and makes abroad no waste
sport then like turtels and bring forth such pledges as may be assurance of the fathers worth and mothers purity
juno doth bless the nuptial bed thus hymens torches burn
live long and may when both are dead your ashes fill one vrn
book enteratinment of the forests queen
book welcome thrice welcome to this shady green our long wish'd cinthia the forests queen the trees begin to bud the glad birds sing in winter chang'd by her into the spring

from you in fee their lives your liegemen hold
these groves your kingdom and our law your will smile and we spare but if you frown we kill
bless then the hour that gives the power in which you may at bed and board embrace your lord both night and day
welcome thrice welcome to this shady green our long wish'd cinthia the forests queen
