rome after the second sounding
arises in the midst of the stage
light i salute thee but with wounded nerves wishing the golden splendor pitchy darkness
ay this this is it that our sunk eyes have waked for all this while here will be subject for my snakes and me
cling to my neck and wrists my loving worms and cast you round in soft and amorous folds till i do bid uncurl then break your knots shoot out yourselves at length as your forced stings would hide themselves within his maliced sides to whom i shall apply you
the shine of this assembly here offends my sight i'll darken that first and outface their grace
wonder not if i stare these fifteen weeks so long as since the plot was but an embrion have i with burning lights mixt vigilant thoughts in expectation of this hated play to which at last i am arrived as prologue
nor would i you should look for other looks gesture or compliment from me than what the infected bulk of envy can afford for i am risse here with a covetous hope to blast your pleasures and destroy your sports with wrestings comments applications spy like suggestions privy whisperings and thousand such promoting sleights as these
mark how i will begin the scene is ha
crack eye strings and your balls drop into earth let me be ever blind
i am prevented all my hopes are crost check'd and abated fie a freezing sweat flows forth at all my pores my entrails burn what should i do
o my vext soul how might i force this to the present state
are there no players here
no poet apes that come with basilisk' s eyes whose forked tongues are steeped in venom as their hearts in gall
either of these would help me they could wrest pervert and poison all they hear or see with senseless glosses and allusions
now if you be good devils fly me not
you know what dear and ample faculties i have endowed you with i'll lend you more
here take my snakes among you come and eat and while the squeez'd juice flows in your black jaws help me to damn the author
spit it forth upon his lines and shew your rusty teeth at every word or accent or else choose out of my longest vipers to stick down in your deep throats and let the heads come forth at your rank mouths that he may see you arm'd with triple malice to hiss sting and tear
his work and him to forge and then declaim traduce corrupt apply inform suggest o these are gifts wherein your souls are blest
do you hide yourselves
what doth this calm troop affright you
nay then i do despair down sink again this travail is all lost with my dead hopes
if in such bosoms spite have left to dwell envy is not on earth nor scarce in hell
as she disappears enter hastily in armour
stay monster ere thou sink thus on thy head set we our bolder foot with which we tread thy malice into earth so spite should die despised and scorn'd by noble industry
if any muse why i salute the stage an armed prologue know 'tis a dangerous age wherein who writes had need present his scenes forty fold proof against the conjuring means of base detractors and illiterate apes that fill up rooms in fair and formal shapes
'gainst these have we put on this forced defence whereof the allegory and hid sense is that a well erected confidence can fright their pride and laugh their folly hence
here now put case our author should once more swear that his play were good he doth implore you would not argue him of arrogance howe'er that common spawn of ignorance our fry of writers may beslime his fame and give his action that adulterate name
such full blown vanity he more doth loth than base dejection there's a mean 'twixt both which with a constant firmness he pursues as one that knows the strength of his own muse
and this he hopes all free souls will allow others that take it with a rugged brow their moods he rather pities than envies his mind it is above their injuries
i scene draws and discovers in his study
then when this body falls in funeral fire my name shall live and my best part aspire
it shall go so
enter luscus with a gown and cap
young master master ovid do you hear
away with your songs and sonnets and on with your gown and cap quickly here here your father will be a man of this room presently
come nay nay nay nay be brief
these verses too a poison on 'em
i cannot abide them they make me ready to cast by the banks of helicon
nay look what a rascally untoward thing this poetry is i could tear them now
give me how near is my father
heart a'man get a law book in your hand i will not answer you else
ovid puts on his cap and gown
now there's some formality in you
by jove and three or four of the gods more i am right of mine old master's humour for that this villainous poetry will undo you by the welkin
what hast thou buskins on luscus that thou swearest so tragically and high
no but i have boots on sir and so has your father too by this time for he call'd for them ere i came from the lodging
why was he no readier
o no and there was the mad skeldering captain with the velvet arms ready to lay hold on him as he comes down he that presses every man he meets with an oath to lend him money and cries thou must do't old boy as thou art a man a man of worship
ay he and i met little master lupus the tribune going thither too
nay an he be under their arrest i may with safety enough read over my elegy before he come
what will you do
why young master you are not castalian mad lunatic frantic desperate ha
what ailest thou luscus
god be with you sir i'll leave you to your poetical fancies and furies
i'll not be guilty exit
be not good ignorance
i'm glad th'art gone for thus alone our ear shall better judge the hasty errors of our morning muse
envy why twit'st thou me my time's spent ill and call'st my verse fruits of an idle quill
or that unlike the line from whence i sprung war's dusty honours i pursue not young
or that i study not the tedious laws and prostitute my voice in every cause
thy scope is mortal mine eternal fame which through the world shall ever chaunt my name
homer will live whilst tenedos stands and ide or to the sea fleet simois doth slide and so shall hesiod too while vines do bear or crooked sickles crop the ripen'd ear
callimachus though in invention low shall still be sung since he in art doth flow
no loss shall come to sophocles' proud vein with sun and moon aratus shall remain
while slaves be false fathers hard and bawds be whorish whilst harlots flatter shall menander flourish
ennius though rude and accius's high rear'd strain a fresh applause in every age shall gain of varro's name what ear shall not be told of jason's argo and the fleece of gold
then shall lucretius' lofty numbers die when earth and seas in fire and flame shall fry
tityrus tillage aenee shall be read whilst rome of all the conquered world is head
till cupid's fires be out and his bow broken thy verses neat tibullus shall be spoken
our gallus shall be known from east to west so shall lycoris whom he now loves best
the suffering plough share or the flint may wear but heavenly poesy no death can fear
kings shall give place to it and kingly shows the banks o'er which gold bearing tagus flows
kneel hinds to trash me let bright phoebus swell with cups full flowing from the muses' well
frost fearing myrtle shall impale my head and of sad lovers i be often read
envy the living not the dead doth bite
for after death all men receive their right
then when this body falls in funeral fire my name shall live and my best part aspire
enter senior followed by luscus tucca and lupus
your name shall live indeed sir
you say true but how infamously how scorn'd and contemn'd in the eyes and ears of the best and gravest romans that you think not on you never so much as dream of that
are these the fruits of all my travail and expenses
is this the scope and aim of thy studies
are these the hopeful courses wherewith i have so long flattered my expectation from thee
ovid whom i thought to see the pleader become ovid the play maker
yes sir i hear of a tragedy of yours coming forth for the common players there call'd medea
by my household gods if i come to the acting of it i'll add one tragic part more than is yet expected to it believe me when i promise it
shall i have my son a stager now
an enghle for players
a gull a rook a shot clog to make suppers and be laugh'd at
publius i will set thee on the funeral pile first
sir i beseech you to have patience
nay this 'tis to have your ears damn'd up to good counsel
i did augur all this to him beforehand without poring into an ox's paunch for the matter and yet he would not be scrupulous
how now goodman slave
why my master of worship dost hear
are these thy best projects
is this thy designs and thy discipline to suffer knaves to be competitors with commanders and gentlemen
are we parallels rascal are we parallels
sirrah go get my horses ready
you'll still be prating
do you perpetual stinkard do go talk to tapsters and ostlers you slave they are in your element go here be the emperor's captains you raggamuffin rascal and not your comrades
marcus ovid these players are an idle generation and do much harm in a state corrupt young gentry very much i know it i have not been a tribune thus long and observed nothing besides they will rob us us that are magistrates of our respect bring us upon their stages and make us ridiculous to the plebeians they will play you or me the wisest men they can come by still only to bring us in contempt with the vulgar and make us cheap
thou art in the right my venerable cropshin they will indeed the tongue of the oracle never twang'd truer
your courtier cannot kiss his mistress's slippers in quiet for them nor your white innocent gallant pawn his revelling suit to make his punk a supper
an honest decayed commander cannot skelder cheat nor be seen in a bawdy house but he shall be straight in one of their wormwood comedies
they are grown licentious the rogues libertines flat libertines
they forget they are in the statute the rascals they are blazon'd there there they are trick'd they and their pedigrees they need no other heralds i wiss
methinks if nothing else yet this alone the very reading of the public edicts should fright thee from commerce with them and give thee distaste enough of their actions
but this betrays what a student you are this argues your proficiency in the law
they wrong me sir and do abuse you more that blow your ears with these untrue reports
i am not known unto the open stage nor do i traffic in their theatres indeed i do acknowledge at request of some near friends and honourable romans i have begun a poem of that nature
you have sir a poem
and where is it
that's the law you study
cornelius gallus borrowed it to read
there's another gallant too hath drunk of the same poison and tibullus and propertius
but these are gentlemen of means and revenues now
thou art a younger brother and hast nothing but they bare exhibition which i protest shall be bare indeed if thou forsake not these unprofitable by courses and that timely too
name me a profest poet that his poetry did ever afford him so much as a competency
ay your god of poets there whom all of you admire and reverence so much homer he whose worm eaten statue must not be spewed against but with hallow'd lips and groveling adoration what was he
marry i'll tell thee old swaggerer he was a poor blind rhyming rascal that lived obscurely up and down in booths and tap houses and scarce ever made a good meal in his sleep the whoreson hungry beggar
he says well nay i know this nettles you now but answer me is it not true
you'll tell me his name shall live and that now being dead his works have eternised him and made him divine but could this divinity feed him while he lived
could his name feast him
or purchase him a senator's revenue could it
ay or give him place in the commonwealth
make him be carried in his litter
thou speakest sentences old bias
all this the law will do young sir if you'll follow it
if he be mine he shall follow and observe what i will apt him to or i profess here openly and utterly to disclaim him
sir let me crave you will forego these moods i will be any thing or study any thing i'll prove the unfashion'd body of the law pure elegance and make her rugged'st strains run smoothly as propertius' elegies ovid se
nay you take him too quickly marcus ovid se
why he cannot speak he cannot think out of poetry he is bewitch'd with it
come do not misprise him
ay marry i would have him use some such words now they have some touch some taste of the law
he should make himself a style out of these and let his propertius' elegies go by
indeed young publius he that will now hit the mark must shoot through the law we have no other planet reigns and in that sphere you may sit and sing with angels
why the law makes a man happy without respecting any other merit a simple scholar or none at all may be a lawyer
he tells thee true my noble neophyte my little gram maticaster he does it shall never put thee to thy mathematics metaphysics philosophy and i know not what supposed suficiencies if thou canst but have the patience to plod enough talk and make a noise enough be impudent enough and 'tis enough
three books will furnish you
and the less art the better besides when it shall be in the power of thy chevril conscience to do right or wrong at thy pleasure my pretty alcibiades
ay and to have better men than himself by many thousand degrees to observe him and stand bare
true and he to carry himself proud and stately and have the law on his side for't old boy
well the day grows old gentlemen and i must leave you
publius if thou wilt hold my favour abandon these idle fruitless studies that so bewitched thee
send janus home his back face again and look only forward to the law intend that
i will i allow thee what shall suit thee in the rank of gentlemen and maintain thy society with the best and under these conditions i leave thee
my blessings light upon thee if thou respect them if not mine eyes may drop for thee but thine own heart will ache for itself and so farewell
what are my horses come
yes sir they are at the gate without
asinius lupus a word
captain i shall take my leave of you

enter and whispers how now my carrier what news
the boy has stayed within for his cue this half hour
come do not whisper to me but speak it out what it is no treason against the state i hope is it
yes against the state of my master's purse
sir agrippa desires you to forbear him till the next week his mules are not yet come up
now the bots the spavin and the glanders and some dozen diseases more light on him and his mules
what have they the yellows his mules that they come no faster
or are they foundered ha
his mules have the staggers belike have they
o no sir then your tongue might be suspected for one of his mules
tuc he owes me almost a talent and he thinks to bear it away with his mules does he
sirrah you nut cracker

what will he clem me and my followers
ask him an he will clem me do go
he would have me fry my jerkin would he
yet stay my little tumbler this old boy shall supply now
i will not trouble him i cannot be importunate i i cannot be impudent
alas sir no you are the most maidenly blushing creature upon the earth
dost thou hear my little six and fifty or thereabouts
thou art not to learn the humours and tricks of that old bald cheater time thou hast not this chain for nothing
men of worth have their chimeras as well as other creatures and they do see monsters sometimes they do they do brave boy
better cheap than he shall see you i warrant him
thou must let me have six six drachma i mean old boy thou shalt do it i tell thee old boy thou shalt and in private too dost thou see
go walk off to the boy there there
six is the sum
thy son's a gallant spark and must not be put out of a sudden
come hither callimachus thy father tells me thou art too poetical boy thou must not be so thou must leave them young novice thou must they are a sort of poor starved rascals that are ever wrap'd up in foul linen and can boast of nothing but a lean visage peering out of a seam rent suit the very emblems of beggary
no dost hear turn lawyer thou shalt be my solicitor
'tis right old boy is't
you were best tell it captain
no fare thou well mine honest horseman and thou old beaver
to lupus pray thee roman when thou comest to town see me at my lodging visit me sometimes

boy you can have but half a share now boy exit followed by pyrgus
'tis a strange boldness that accompanies this fellow
i'll give attendance on you to your horse sir please you
no keep your chamber and fall to your studies do so the gods of rome bless thee
and give me stomach to digest this law that should have follow'd sure had i been he
o sacred poesy thou spirit of arts the soul of science and the queen of souls what profane violence almost sacrilege hath here been offered thy divinities
that thine own guiltless poverty should arm prodigious ignorance to wound thee thus
for thence is all their force of argument drawn forth against thee or from the abuse of thy great powers in adulterate brains when would men learn but to distinguish spirits and set true difference 'twixt those jaded wits that run a broken pace for common hire and the high raptures of a happy muse borne on the wings of her immortal thought that kicks at earth with a disdainful heel and beats at heaven gates with her bright hoofs they would not then with such distorted faces and desperate censures stab at poesy
they would admire bright knowledge and their minds should ne'er descend on so unworthy objects as gold or titles they would dread far more to be thought ignorant than be known poor
the time was once when wit drown'd wealth but now your only barbarism is t'have wit and want
no matter now in virtue who excels he that hath coin hath all perfection else
good morrow dear tibullus welcome sit down
not what so hard at it
let's see what's here
numa in decimo nono
i nay i will see it ovid
if thrice in field a man vanquish his foe 'tis after in his choice to serve or no
law cases in verse
in truth i know not they run from my pen unwittingly if they be verse
what's the news abroad
gown i come to have thee walk
no good tibullus i'm not now in case
pray let me alone
slight thou'rt in too much case by all this law
troth if i live i will new dress the law in sprightly poesy's habiliments
the hell thou wilt
turn law into verse thy father has school'd thee i see
here read that same there's subject for you and if i mistake not a supersedeas to your melancholy
o my life my heaven
is the mood changed
note for th' harmonious spheres
celestial accents how you ravish me
what is it ovid
that i must meet my julia the princess julia
why at heart i've forgot my passion so transports me
i'll save your pains it is at albius' house the jeweller's where the fair lycoris lies
cytheris cornelius gallus' love
ay he'll be there too and my plautia
and why not your delia
yes and your corinna
true but my sweet tibullus keep that secret i would not for all rome it should be thought i veil bright julia underneath that name julia the gem and jewel of my soul that takes her honours from the golden sky as beauty doth all lustre from her eye
the air respires the pure elysian sweets in which she breathes and from her looks descend the glories of the summer
heaven she is praised in herself above all praise and he which hears her speak would swear the tuneful orbs turn'd in his zenith only
publius thou'lt lose thyself
o in no labyrinth can i safelier err than when i lose myself in praising her
hence law and welcome muses though not rich yet are you pleasing let's be reconciled and new made one
henceforth i promise faith and all my serious hours to spend with you with you whose music striketh on my heart and with bewitching tones steals forth my spirit in julia's name fair julia julia's love shall be a law and that sweet law i'll study the law and art of sacred julia's love all other objects will but abjects prove
come we shall have thee as passionate as propertius anon
o how does my sextus
faith full of sorrow for his cynthia's death
still and still more his griefs do grow upon him as do his hours
never did i know an understanding spirit so take to heart the common work of fate
o my tibullus let us not blame him for against such chances the heartiest strife of virtue is not proof
we may read constancy and fortitude
to other souls but had ourselves been struck with the like planet had our loves like his been ravish'd from us by injurious death and in the height and heat of our best days it would have crack'd our sinews shrunk our veins and made our very heart strings jar like his
come let's go take him forth and prove if mirth or company will but abate his passion
content and i implore the gods it may
a room in house
master crispinus you are welcome pray use a stool sir
your cousin cytheris will come down presently
we are so busy for the receiving of these courtiers here that i can scarce be a minute with myself for thinking of them pray you sit sir pray you sit sir
i am very well sir
never trust me but your are most delicately seated here full of sweet delight and blandishment
an excellent air an excellent air
ay sir 'tis a pretty air
these courtiers run in my mind still i must look out

i am most strenuously well i thank you sir
much good do you sir
enter with two maids
come bring those perfumes forward a little and strew some roses and violets here fie

why this is good excellent excellent
well said my sweet chloe trim up your house most obsequiously
for vulcan's sake breathe somewhere else in troth you overcome our perfumes exceedingly you are too predominant
hear but my opinion sweet wife
a pin for your pinion
in sincerity if you be thus fulsome to me in every thing i'll be divorced
you know what you were before i married you i was a gentlewoman born i i lost all my friends to be a citizen's wife because i heard indeed they kept their wives as fine as ladies and that we might rule our husbands like ladies and do what we listed do you think i would have married you else
i acknowledge sweet wife she speaks the best of any woman in italy and moves as mightily which makes me i had rather she should make bumps on my head as big as my two fingers than i would offend her but sweet wife chloe
is it not grace enough for you that i call you husband and you call me wife but you must still be poking me against my will to things
but you know wife
here are the greatest ladies and gallantest gentlemen of rome to be entertained in our house now and i would fain advise thee to entertain them in the best sort i'faith wife
in sincerity did you ever hear a man talk so idly
you would seem to be master
you would have your spoke in my cart
you would advise me to entertain ladies and gentlemen
because you can marshal your pack needles horse combs hobby horses and wall candlesticks in your warehouse better than i therefore you can tell how to entertain ladies and gentlefolks better than alb
o my sweet wife upbraid me not with that gain savours sweetly from any thing he that respects to get must relish all commodities alike and admit no difference between oade and frankincense or the most precious balsamum and a tar barrel
you sell snuffers too if you be remember'd but i pray you let me buy them out of your hand for i tell you true i take it highly in snuff to learn how to entertain gentlefolks of you at these years i'faith
alas man there was not a gentleman came to your house in your t'other wife's time i hope
nor a lady nor music nor masques
nor you nor your house were so much as spoken of before i disbased myself from my hood and my farthingal to these bum rowls and your whale bone bodice
look here my sweet wife i am mum my dear mummia my balsamum my spermaceti and my very city of she has the most best true feminine wit in rome
i have heard so sir and do most vehemently desire to participate the knowledge of her fair features
ah peace you shall hear more anon be not seen yet i pray you not yet observe
give husbands the head a little more and they'll be nothing but head shortly what's he there
i know not forsooth
who would you speak with sir
i would speak with my cousin cytheris
he is one forsooth would speak with his cousin cytheris
is she your cousin sir
yes in truth forsooth for fault of a better
she is a gentlewoman
or else she should not be my cousin i assure you
are you a gentleman born
that i am lady you shall see mine arms if it please you
no your legs do sufficiently shew you are a gentleman born sir for a man borne upon little legs is always a gentleman born
yet i pray you vouchsafe the sight of my arms mistress for i bear them about me to have them seen my name is crispinus or crispinas indeed which is well expressed in my arms a face crying in chief and beneath it a bloody toe between three thorns pungent
then you are welcome sir now you are a gentleman born i can find in my heart to welcome you for i am a gentlewoman born too and will bear my head high enough though 'twere my fortune to marry a tradesman
no doubt of that sweet feature your carriage shews it in any man's eye that is carried upon you with judgment
dear wife be not angry
hear me but one thing let not your maids set cushions in the parlour windows nor in the dining chamber windows nor upon stools in either of them in any case for 'tis tavern like but lay them one upon another in some out room or corner of the dining chamber
go go meddle with your bed chamber only or rather with your bed in your chamber only or rather with your wife in your bed only or on my faith i'll not be pleased with you only
look here my dear wife entertain that gentleman kindly i prithee mum
go i need your instructions indeed
anger me no more i advise you
she's a wise gentlewoman i'faith will marry herself to the sin of the city
but this time and no more by heav'n wife hang no pictures in the hall nor in the dining chamber in any case but in the gallery only for 'tis not courtly else my word wife
'sprecious never have done
do i not bear a reasonable corrigible hand over him crispinus
by this hand lady you hold a most sweet hand over him
and then for the great gilt andirons chloe
would the andirons were in your great guts for me
i do vanish wife
how shall i do master crispinus
here will be all the bravest ladies in court presently to see your cousin cytheris o the gods
how might i behave myself now as to entertain them most courtly
marry lady if you will entertain them most courtly you must do thus as soon as ever your maid or your man brings you word they are come you must say a pox on 'em i what do they here
and yet when they come speak them as fair and give them the kindest welcome in words that can be
is that the fashion of courtiers crispinus
i assure you it is lady i have observed it
for your pox sir it is easily hit on but it is not so easy to speak fair after methinks
o wife the coaches are come on my word a number of coaches and courtiers
a pox on them
what do they here
would'st thou not have them come
come you are a fool you
he knows not the trick on't
call cytheris i pray you and good master crispinus you can observe you say let me entreat you for all the ladies' behaviours jewels jests and attires that you marking as well as i we may put both our marks together when they are gone and confer of them
i warrant you sweet lady let me alone to observe till i turn myself to nothing but observation

health to the lovely chloe
you must pardon me mistress that i prefer this fair gentlewoman
i pardon and praise you for it sir and i beseech your excellence receive her beauties into your knowledge and favour
cytheris she hath favour and behaviour that commands as much of me and sweet chloe know i do exceedingly love you and that i will approve in any grace my father the emperor may shew you
is this your husband
for fault of a better if it please your highness
gods my life how he shames me
not a whit chloe they all think you politic and witty wise women choose not husbands for the eye merit or birth but wealth and sovereignty
sir we all come to gratulate for the good report of you
and would be glad to deserve your love sir
my wife will answer you all gentlemen i'll come to you again presently
you have chosen you a most fair companion here cytheris and a very fair house
to both which you and all my friends are very welcome plautia
with all my heart i assure your ladyship
thanks sweet mistress chloe
you must needs come to court lady i'faith and there be sure your welcome shall be as great to us
she will deserve it madam i see even in her looks gentry and general worthiness
i have not seen a more certain character of an excellent disposition
o they do so commend me here the courtiers
what's the matter now
for the banquet sweet wife
yes and i must needs come to court and be welcome the princess says
ovid and tibullus you may be bold to welcome your mistress here
we find it so sir
and thank cornelius gallus
nay my sweet sextus in faith thou art not sociable
in faith i am not publius nor i cannot
sick minds are like sick men that burn with fevers who when they drink please but a present taste and after bear a more impatient fit
pray let me leave you i offend you all and myself most
you yield too much unto your griefs and fate which never hurts but when we say it hurts us
o peace tibullus your philosophy lends you too rough a hand to search my wounds
speak they of griefs that know to sigh and grieve the free and unconstrained spirit feels no weight of my oppression
methinks i taste his misery and could sit down and chide at his malignant stars
methinks i love him that he loves so truly
this is the perfect'st love lives after death
such is the constant ground of virtue still
it puts on an inseparable face
have you mark'd every thing crispinus
every thing i warrant you
what gentlemen are these
do you know them
ay they are poets lady
they did not talk of me since i went did they
o yes and extolled your perfections to the heavens
now in sincerity they be the finest kind of men that ever i knew poets
could not one get the emperor to make my husband a poet think you
no lady 'tis love and beauty make poets and since you like poets so well your love and beauties shall make me a poet
and such a one as these
ay and a better than these i would be sorry else
and shall your looks change and your hair change and all like these
why a man may be a poet and yet not change his hair lady
well we shall see your cunning yet if you can change your hair i pray do
ladies and lordlings there's a slight banquet stays within for you please you draw near and accost it
we thank you good albius but when shall we see those excellent jewels you are commended to have
at your ladyship's service
i got that speech by seeing a play last day and it did me some grace now i see 'tis good to collect sometimes i'll frequent these plays more than i have done now i come to be familiar with courtiers
why how now hermogenes
what ailest thou trow
her a little melancholy let me alone prithee
melancholy i how so
with riding a plague on all coaches for me
is that hard favour'd gentleman a poet too cytheris
no this is hermogenes as humorous as a poet though he is a musician
then he can sing
that he can excellently did you never hear him
o no will he be entreated think you
friend mistress chloe would fain hear hermogenes sing are you interested in him
no doubt his own humanity will command him so far to the satisfaction of so fair a beauty but rather than fail we'll all be suitors to him
for honour of this gentlewoman to whose house i know thou mayest be ever welcome
that he shall in truth sir if he can sing
this gentlewoman is wooing hermogenes for a song
come he shall not deny her
no the ladies must do it he stays but to have their thanks acknowledged as a debt to his cunning
that shall not want ourself will be the first shall promise to pay him more than thanks upon a favour so worthily vouchsafed
thank you madam but 'will not sing
tut the only way to win him is to abstain from entreating him
cris do you love singing lady
entreat the ladies to entreat me to sing then i beseech you
i beseech your grace entreat this gentleman to sing
that we will chloe can he sing excellently
i think so madam for he entreated me to entreat you to entreat him to sing
would you tell that
good sir let's entreat you to use your voice
alas madam i cannot in truth
the gentleman is modest i warrant you he sings excellently
hermogenes clear your throat i see by him here's a gentleman will worthily challenge you
not i sir i'll challenge no man
that's your modesty sir but we out of an assurance of your excellency challenge him in your behalf
i thank you gentlemen i'll do my best
let that best be good sir you were best
o this contention is excellent
what is't you sing sir
if i freely may discover sir i'll sing that
one of your own compositions hermogenes
he offers you vantage enough
nay truly gentlemen i'll challenge no man
i can sing but one staff of the ditty neither
the better hermogenes himself will be entreated to sing the other
if i freely may discover what would please me in my lover i would have her fair and witty savouring more of court than city a little proud but full of pity light and humorous in her toying oft building hopes and soon destroying long but sweet in the enjoying neither too easy nor too hard all extremes i would have barr'd
believe me sir you sing most excellently
if there were a praise above excellence the gentleman highly deserves it
sir all this doth not yet make me envy you for i know i sing better than you
she should be allow'd her passions so they were but used as fashions sometimes froward and then frowning sometimes sickish and then swowning every fit with change still crowning
purely jealous i would have her then only constant when i crave her 'tis a virtue should not save her
thus nor her delicates would cloy me neither her peevishness annoy me
nay hermogenes your merit hath long since been 'both known and admired of us
you shall hear me sing another
now will i begin
we shall do this gentleman's banquet too much wrong that stays for us ladies
'tis true and well thought on cornelius gallus
why 'tis but a short air 'twill be done presently pray stay strike music
no good hermogenes we'll end this difference within
'tis the common disease of all your musicians that they know no mean
to be entreated either to begin or end
please you lead the way gentles
exeunt all but albius
o what a charm of thanks was here put upon me
o jove what a setting forth it is to a man to have many courtiers come to his house
sweetly was it said of a good old housekeeper i had rather want meat than want guests especially if they be courtly guests
for never trust me if one of their good legs made in a house be not worth all the good cheer a man can make them
he that would have fine guests let him have a fine wife
he that would have a fine wife let him come to me
by your kind leave master albius
what you are not gone master crispinus
yes faith i have a design draws me hence pray sir fashion me an excuse to the ladies
will you not stay and see the jewels sir
i pray you stay
not for a million sir now
let it suffice i must relinquish and so in a word please you to expiate this compliment
i'll presently go and enghle some broker for a poet's gown and bespeak a garland and then jeweller look to your best jewel i'faith
the via sacra or holy street
yes i will begin an ode so and it shall be to mecaenas
they say he's an excellent poet mecaenas loves him
i'll fall into his acquaintance if i can i think he be composing as he goes in the street
'tis a good humour if he be i'll compose too
swell me a bowl with lus'y wine till i may see the plump lyoeus swim above the brim i drink as i would write in flowing measure fill'd with flame and sprite
sweet horace minerva and the muses stand auspicious to thy designs
how farest thou sweet man
not greatly gallant sir like my fortunes well i am bold to take my leave sir you'll nought else sir would you
troth no but i could wish thou didst know us horace we are a scholar i assure thee
i shall be covetous of your fair knowledge
nay we are new turn'd poet too which is more and a satirist too which is more than that i write just in thy vein i am for your odes or your sermons or any thing indeed we are a gentleman besides our name is rufus laberius crispinus we are a pretty stoic too
to the proportion of your beard i think it sir
by phoebus here's a most neat fine street is't not
i protest to thee i am enamoured of this street now more than of half the streets of rome again 'tis so polite and terse
there's the front of a building now
i study architecture too if ever i should build i'd have a house just of that prospective
doubtless this gallant's tongue has a good turn when he sleeps
i do make verses when i come in such a street as this o your city ladies you shall have them sit in every shop like the muses offering you the castalian dews and the thespian liquors to as many as have but the sweet grace and audacity to sip of their lips
did you never hear any of my verses
no sir but i am in some fear i must now
i'll tell thee some if i can but recover them i composed even now of a dressing i saw a jeweller's wife wear who indeed was a jewel herself i prefer that kind of tire now what's thy opinion horace
with your silver bodkin it does well sir
i cannot tell but it stirs me more than all your court curls or your spangles or your tricks i affect not these high gable ends these tuscan tops nor your coronets nor your arches nor your pyramids give me a fine sweet little delicate dressing with a bodkin as you say and a mushroom for all your other ornatures
is it not possible to make an escape from him
i have remitted my verses all this while i think i have forgot them
here's he could wish you had else
pray jove i can entreat them of my memory
you put your memory to too much trouble sir
no sweet horace we must not have thee think so
i cry you mercy then they are my ears that must be tortured well you must have patience ears
pray thee horace observe
yes sir your satin sleeve begins to fret at the rug that is underneath it i do observe and your ample velvet bases are not without evident stains of a hot disposition naturally
o i'll dye them into another colour at pleasure how many yards of velvet dost thou think they contain
i have put him now in a fresh way to vex me more faith sir your mercer's book will tell you with more patience than i can for i am crost and so's not that i think
'slight these verses have lost me again
i shall not invite them to mind now
rack not your thoughts good sir rather defer it to a new time i'll meet you at your lodging or where you please 'till then jove keep you sir
nay gentle horace stay i have it now
apollo hermes jupiter look down upon me
rich was thy hap sweet dainty cap there to be placed where thy smooth black sleek white may smack and both be graced
white is there usurp'd for her brow her forehead and then sleek as the parallel to smooth that went before
a kind of paranomasie or agnomination do you conceive sir
troth sir i must be abrupt and leave you
why what haste hast thou
prithee stay a little thou shalt not go yet by phoebus
fie how i sweat with suffering
pray sir give me leave to wipe my face a little
yes do good horace
i must crave his leave to p anon
or that i may go hence with half my teeth i am in some such fear
this tyranny is strange to take mine ears up by commission whether i will or no and make them stalls to his lewd solecisms and worded trash
happy thou bold bolanus now i say whose freedom and impatience of this fellow would long ere this have call'd him fool and fool and rank and tedious fool
and have flung jests as hard as stones till thou hadst pelted him out of the place whilst my tame modesty suffers my wit be made a solemn ass to bear his fopperies aside
horace thou art miserably affected to be gone i see
but prithee let's prove to enjoy thee a while
thou hast no business i assure me
whither is thy journey directed ha
sir i am going to visit a friend that's sick
what is he do not i know him
no sir you do not know him and 'tis not the worse for him
what's his name where is he lodged
where i shall be fearful to draw you out of your way sir a great way hence pray sir let's part
nay but where is't
on the far side of all tyber yonder by caesar's gardens
o that's my course directly i am for you
come go why stand'st thou
yes sir marry the plague is in that part of the city i had almost forgot to tell you sir
it is no matter i fear no pestilence i have not offended phoebus
i have it seems or else this heavy scourge could ne'er have lighted on me
i am to go down some half mile this way sir first to speak with his physician and from thence to his apothecary where i shall stay the mixing of divers drugs
why it's all one i have nothing to do and i love not to be idle i'll bear thee company
how call'st thou the apothecary
o that i knew a name would fright him now
sir rhadamanthus rhadamanthus sir
there's one so called is a just judge in hell and doth inflict strange vengeance on all those that here on earth torment poor patient spirits
he dwells at the three furies by janus's temple
your pothecary does sir
heart i owe him money for sweetmeats and he has laid to arrest me i hear but hor sir i have made a most solemn vow i will never bail any man
well then i'll swear and speak him fair if the worst come
but his name is minos not rhadamanthus horace
that may be sir i but guess'd at his name by his sign
but your minos is a judge too sir
cris i protest to thee horace do but taste me once if i do know myself and mine own virtues truly thou wilt not make that esteem of varius or virgil or tibullus or any of 'em indeed as now in thy ignorance thou dost which i am content to forgive i would fain see which of these could pen more verses in a day or with more facility than i or that could court his mistress kiss her hand make better sport with her fan or her dog hor
i cannot bail you yet sir
or that could move his body more gracefully or dance better you should see me were it not in the street hor
why i have been a reveller and at my cloth of silver suit and my long stocking in my time and will be again hor
if you may be trusted sir
and then for my singing hermogenes himself envies me that is your only master of music you have in rome
is your mother living sir
convert thy thoughts to somewhat else i pray thee
you have much of the mother in you sir your father is dead
ay i thank jove and my grandfather too and all my kinsfolks and well composed in their urns
the more their happiness that rest in peace free from the abundant torture of thy tongue would i were with them too
i now remember me sir of a sad fate a cunning woman one sabella sung when in her urn she cast my destiny i being but a child
what was it i pray thee
she told me i should surely never perish by famine poison or the enemy's sword the hectic fever cough or pleurisy should never hurt me nor the tardy gout but in my time i should be once surprised by a strong tedious talker that should vex and almost bring me to consumption therefore if i were wise she warn'd me shun all such long winded monsters as my bane for if i could but 'scape that one discourser i might no doubt prove an old aged man
by your leave sir
tut tut abandon this idle humour 'tis nothing but melancholy
'fore jove now i think on't i am to appear in court here to answer to one that has me in suit sweet horace go with me this is my hour if i neglect it the law proceeds against me
thou art familiar with these things prithee if thou lov'st me go
now let me die sir if i know your laws or have the power to stand still half so long in their loud courts as while a case is argued
besides you know sir where i am to go
and the necessity cris
i hope the hour of my release be come he will upon this consideration discharge me sure
troth i am doubtful what i may best do whether to leave thee or my affairs horace
me sir me by any means i beseech you me sir
no faith i'll venture those now thou shalt see i love thee some horace
nay then i am desperate i follow you sir
'tis hard contending with a man that overcomes thus
and how deals mecaenas with thee
is he open handed
he's still himself sir
troth horace thou art exceeding happy in thy friends and acquaintance they are all most choice spirits and of the first rank of romans i do not know that poet i protest has used his fortune more prosperously than thou hast
if thou wouldst bring me known to mecaenas i should second thy desert well thou shouldst find a good sure assistant of me one that would speak all good of thee in thy absence and be content with the next place not envying thy reputation with thy patron
let me not live but i think thou and i in a small time should lift them all out of favour both virgil varius and the best of them and enjoy him wholly to ourselves
gods you do know it i can hold no longer this brize has prick'd my patience
sir your silkness clearly mistakes mecaenas and his house to think there breathes a spirit beneath his roof subject unto those poor affections of undermining envy and detraction moods only proper to base grovelling minds
that place is not in rome i dare affirm more pure or free from such low common evils
there's no man griev'd that this is thought more rich or this more learned each man hath his place and to his merit his reward of grace which with a mutual love they all embrace
you report a wonder 'tis scarce credible this
l am no torturer to enforce you to believe it but it is so cris
why this inflames me with a more ardent desire to be his than before but i doubt i shall find the entrance to his familiarity somewhat more than difficult horace
tut you'll conquer him as you have done me there's no standing out against you sir i see that either your importunity or the intimation of your good parts or cris
nay i'll bribe his porter and the grooms of his chamber make his doors open to me that way first and then i'll observe my times
say he should extrude me his house to day shall i there fore desist or let fall my suit to morrow
no i'll attend him follow him meet him in the street the highways run by his coach never leave him
man hath nothing given him in this life without much labour hor
archer of heaven phoebus take thy bow and with a full drawn shaft nail to the earth this python that i may yet run hence and live or brawny hercules do thou come down and tho' thou mak'st it up thy thirteenth labour rescue me from this hydra of discourse here
o welcome my reliever aristius as thou lov'st me ransom me
what ail'st thou man
'death i am seized on here by a land remora i cannot stir nor move but as he pleases
wilt thou go horace
he cleaves to me like alcides' shirt tearing my flesh and sinews o i've been vex'd and tortured with him beyond forty fevers
for jove's sake find some means to take me from him
yes i will but i'll go first and tell mecaenas
come shall we go
the jest will make his eyes run i'faith
will he leave me
you said you had somewhat to say to me in private
ay but i see you are now employed with that gentleman 'twere offence to trouble you i'll take some fitter opportunity farewell
o my soul and heart how are you cramp'd with anguish
death itself brings not the like convulsions o this day
that ever i should view thy tedious face
horace what passion what humour is this
away good prodigy afflict me not
a friend and mock me thus
never was man so left under the axe

carry not too much under thought betwixt yourself and them nor your city mannerly word forsooth use it not too often in any case but plain ay madam and no madam nor never say your lordship nor your honour but you and you my lord and my lady the other they count too simple and minsitive
and though they desire to kiss heaven with their titles yet they will count them fools that give them too humbly
by my troth lady i would not for a world but you had lain in my house and i'faith you shall not pay a farthing for your board nor your chambers
o sweet mistress chloe
i'faith you shall not lady nay good lady do not offer it
come where be these ladies
by your leave bright stars this gentleman and i are come to man you to court where your late kind entertainment is now to be requited with a heavenly banquet
a heavenly banquet gallus
no less my dear cytheris
that were not strange lady if the epithet were only given for the company invited thither your self and this fair gentle woman
are we invited to court sir
you are lady by the great princess julia who longs to greet you with any favours that may worthily make you an often courtier
in sincerity i thank her sir
you have a coach have you not
the princess hath sent her own lady
that's well i do long to ride in a coach most vehemently
but sweet gallus pray you resolve me why you give that heavenly praise to this earthly banquet
because cytheris it must be celebrated by the heavenly powers all the gods and goddesses will be there to two of which you two must be exalted
a pretty fiction in truth
a fiction indeed chloe and fit for the fit of a poet
why cytheris may not poets from whose divine spirits all the honours of the gods have been deduced entreat so much honour of the gods to have their divine presence at a poetical banquet
suppose that no fiction yet where are your habilities to make us two goddesses at your feast
who knows not cytheris that the sacred breath of a true poet can blow any virtuous humanity up to deity
to tell you the female truth which is the simple truth ladies and to shew that poets in spite of the world are able to deify themselves at this banquet to which you are invited we intend to assume the figures of the gods and to give our several loves the forms of goddesses
ovid will be jupiter the princess julia juno gallus here apollo you cytheris pallas i will be bacchus and my love plautia ceres and to install you and your husband fair chloe in honours equal with ours you shall be a goddess and your husband a god
a god but a lame god lady for he shall be vulcan and you venus and this will make our banquet no less than heavenly
in sincerity it will be sugared
good jove what a pretty foolish thing it is to be a poet
but hark you sweet cytheris could they not possibly leave out my husband
methinks a body's husband does not so well at court a body's friend or so but husband
'tis like your clog to your marmoset for all the world and the heavens
tut never fear chloe
your husband will be left without in the lobby or the great chamber when you shall be put in i'the closet by this lord and by that lady
nay then i am certified he shall go
gentlemen hear you the news

come hither cockatrice here's one will set thee up my sweet punk set thee up
are you a poet so soon sir
crlspinus plays and sings
love is blind and a wanton in the whole world there is scant one such another no not his mother
he hath pluck'd her doves and sparrows to feather his sharp arrows and alone prevaileth while sick venus waileth
but if cypris once recover the wag it shall behove her to look better to him or she will undo him
o most odoriferous music
another orpheus you slave another orpheus
an arion riding on the back of a dolphin rascal

shew them bankrupt shew them they have salt in them and will brook the air stinkard
to his bright mistress canidia
ay sir that's but a borrowed name as ovid's corinna or propertius his cynthia or your nemesis or delia tibullus

why the ditty's all borrowed 'tis horace's hang him plagiary
he borrow of horace
he shall pawn himself to ten brokers first
do you hear poetasters
i know you to be men of worship he shall write with horace for a talent
and let mecaenas and his whole college of critics take his part thou shalt do't young phoebus thou shalt phaeton thou shalt
he is a mere sponge nothing but humours and observation he goes up and down sucking from every society and when he comes home squeezes himself dry again
i know him tuc
thou say'st true my poor poetical fury he will pen all he knows
a sharp thorny tooth a satirical rascal by him he carries hay in his horn he will sooner lose his best friend than his least jest
what he once drops upon paper against a man lives eternally to upbraid him in the mouth of every slave tankard bearer or waterman not a bawd or a boy that comes from the bake house but shall point at him 'tis all dog and scorpion he carries poison in his teeth and a sting in his tail
i'll have the slave whipt one of these days for his satires and his humours by one cashier'd clerk or another
we'll undertake him captain
ay and tickle him i'faith for his arrogancy and his impudence in commending his own things and for his translating i can trace him i'faith
o he is the most open fellow living i had as lieve as a new suit i were at it
say no more then but do it 'tis the only way to get thee a new suit sting him my little neufts i'll give you instructions i'll be your intelligencer we'll all join and hang upon him like so many horse leeches the players and all
we shall sup together soon and then we'll conspire i'faith
o that horace had stayed still here
so would not i for both these would have turn'd pythagoreans then
ay as fishes i'faith come ladies shall we go
we wait you sir
but mistress chloe asks if you have not a god to spare for this gentleman
yes if we can invite him along he shall be mars
has mars any thing to do with venus
o most of all lady
nay then i pray let him be invited and what shall crispinus be
that's a poet is it

gentlemen shall we pray your companies along

good and how are you able to give this intelligence

speak lower you are not now in your theatre stager my sword knave
they directed a letter to you and your fellow sharers forward
yes sir to hire some of our properties as a sceptre and crown for jove and a caduceus for mercury and a petasus reenter lictor
let me see your letter
this is a conjuration a conspiracy this
quickly on with my buskins i'll act a tragedy i'faith
will nothing but our gods serve these poets to profane
player i thank thee
the emperor shall take knowledge of thy good service
a crown and a sceptre
this is good rebellion now
'tis your pothecary sir master minos
what tell'st thou me of pothecaries knave
tell him i have affairs of state in hand i can talk to no apothecaries now
stay the pothecary there
walks in a musing posture
you shall see i have fish'd out a cunning piece of plot now they have had some intelligence that their project is discover'd and now have they dealt with my apothecary to poison me 'tis so knowing that i meant to take physic to day as sure as death 'tis there
jupiter i thank thee that thou hast
yet made me so much of a politician
you are welcome sir take the potion from him there i have an antidote more than you wot of sir throw it on the ground there so
now fetch in the dog and yet we cannot tarry to try experiments now arrest him you shall go with me sir i'll tickle you pothecary i'll give you a glister i'faith
have i the letter
come your fasces lictors the half pikes and the halberds take them down from the lares there
as they are going out enter and mec
whither now asinius lupus with this armory
i cannot talk now i charge you assist me treason
ay if you love the emperor and the state follow me
an apartment in the palace
enter characteristically habited as gods and goddesses
gods and goddesses take your several seats
now mercury move your caduceus and in jupiter's name command silence
in the name of jupiter silence
the crier of the court hath too clarified a voice
oh he is the god of reprehension let him alone 'tis his office
mercury go forward and proclaim after phoebus our high pleasure to all the deities that shall partake this high banquet
the great god jupiter here and at every break in the line crispinus repeats aloud the words of gallus
of his licentious goodness willing to make this feast no fast from any manner of pleasure nor to bind any god or goddess to be any thing the more god or goddess for their names he gives them all free license to speak no wiser than persons of baser titles and to be nothing better than common men or women
and therefore no god shall need to keep himself more strictly to his goddess than any man does to his wife nor any goddess shall need to keep herself more strictly to her god than any woman does to her husband
but since it is no part of wisdom in these days to come into bonds it shall be lawful for every lover to break loving oaths to change their lovers and make love to others as the heat of every one's blood and the spirit of our nectar shall inspire
and jupiter save jupiter
so now we may play the fools by authority
to play the fool by authority is wisdom
away with your mattery sentences momus they are too grave and wise for this meeting
mercury give our jester a stool let him sit by and reach him one of our cates
dost hear mad jupiter
we'll have it enacted he that speaks the first wise word shall be made cuckold
is it not a good motion
deities are you all agreed
all agreed great jupiter
i have read in a book that to play the fool wisely is high wisdom
will you be the first wizard
take his wife mars and make him cuckold quickly
no let me alone with him jupiter i'll make you take heed sir while you live again if there be twelve in a company that you be not the wisest of 'em
no more i will not indeed wife hereafter i'll be here mum
fill us a bowl of nectar ganymede we will drink to our daughter venus
look to your wife vulcan jupiter begins to court her
nay let mars look to it vulcan must do as venus does bear
sirrah boy catamite look you play ganymede well now you slave
do not spill your nectar carry your cup even so
you should have rubbed your face with whites of eggs you rascal till your brows had shone like our sooty brother's here as sleek as a horn book or have steept your lips in wine till you made them so plump that juno might have been jealous of them
punk kiss me punk
here daughter venus i drink to thee
thank you good father jupiter
what wilt thou suffer this ocular temptation
mars is enraged he looks big and begins to stut for anger
well played captain mars
well said minstrel momus i must put you in must when will you be in good fooling of yourself fidler never
o 'tis our fashion to be silent when there is a better fool in place ever
fill to our daughter venus ganymede who fills her father with affection
wilt thou be ranging jupiter before my face
why should jupiter stand in awe of thy face juno
because it is thy wife's face jupiter
what shall a husband be afraid of his wife's face
will she paint it so horribly
we are a king cotquean and we will reign in our pleasures and we will cudgel thee to death if thou find fault with us
i will find fault with thee king cuckold maker what shall the king of gods turn the king of good fellows and have no fellow in wickedness
this makes our poets that know our profaneness live as profane as we by my godhead jupiter will join with all the other gods here bind thee hand and foot throw thee down into the earth and make a poor poet of thee if thou abuse me thus
a good smart tongued goddess a right juno
juno we will cudgel thee juno we told thee so yesterday when thou wert jealous of us for thetis
nay to day she had me in inquisition too
well said my fine phrygian fry inform inform
give me some wine king of heralds i may drink to my cockatrice
no more ganymede we will cudgel thee juno by styx we will
ay 'tis well gods may grow impudent in iniquity and they must not be told of it ovid
yea we will knock our chin against our breast and shake thee out of olympus into an oyster boat for thy scolding
your nose is not long enough to do it jupiter if all thy strumpets thou hast among the stars took thy part
and there is never a star in thy forehead but shall be a horn if thou persist to abuse me
a good jest i'faith
we tell thee thou angerest us cotquean and we will thunder thee in pieces for thy cotqueanity
o my hammers and my cyclops
this boy fills not wine enough to make us kind enough to one another
nor thou hast not collied thy face enough stinkard
i'll ply the table with nectar and make them friends
heaven is like to have but a lame skinker then
wine and good livers make true lovers i'll sentence them together
here father here mother for shame drink yourselves drunk and forget this dissension you two should cling together before our faces and give us example of unity
gal o excellently spoken vulcan on the sudden
jupiter may do well to prefer his tongue to some office for his eloquence
his tongue shall be gentleman usher to his wit and still go before it
an excellent fit office
ay and an excellent good jest besides
what have you hired mercury to cry your jests you make
momus you are envious
why ay you whoreson blockhead 'tis your only block of wit in fashion now a days to applaud other folks' jests
true with those that are not artificers themselves
vulcan you nod and the mirth of the jest droops
he has filled nectar so long till his brain swims in it
what do we nod fellow gods
sound music and let us startle our spirits with a song
do apollo thou art a good musician
why do do sing
bacchus what say you
but to this song
sing for my part
your belly weighs down your head bacchus here's a song toward
what else what else
our mirth begins to die quicken it with tunes and wine
raise your notes you're out fie fie
this drowsiness is an ill sign
we banish him the quire of gods that droops agen then all are men for here's not one but nods
i like not this sudden and general heaviness amongst our godheads 'tis somewhat ominous
apollo command us louder music and let mercury and momus contend to please and revive our senses
then in a free and lofty strain
our broken tunes we thus repair cris
and we answer them again running division on the panting air ambo
to celebrate this feast of sense as free from scandal as offence
here is beauty for the eye cris
for the ear sweet melody
ambrosiac odours for the smell cris
delicious nectar for the taste ambo
for the touch a lady's waist which doth all the rest excel
ay this has waked us
mercury our herald go from ourself the great god jupiter to the great emperor augustus caesar and command him from us of whose bounty he hath received the sirname of augustus that for a thank offering to our beneficence he presently sacrifice as a dish to this banquet his beautiful and wanton daughter julia she's a curst quean tell him and plays the scold behind his back therefore let her be sacrificed
command him this mercury in our high name of jupiter altitonans
stay feather footed mercury and tell augustus from us the great juno saturnia if he think it hard to do as jupiter hath commanded him and sacrifice his daughter that he had better do so ten times than suffer her to love the well nosed poet ovid whom he shall do well to whip or cause to be whipped about the capitol for soothing her in her follies
what sight is this
have we our senses
do we hear and see
or are these but imaginary objects drawn by our phantasy
why speak you not
let us do sacrifice
are they the gods
ovid and the rest kneel
reverence amaze and fury fight in me
what do they kneel
nay then i see 'tis true i thought impossible o impious sight
let me divert mine eyes the very thought everts my soul with passion look not man there is a panther whose unnatural eyes will strike thee dead turn then and die on her with her own death
offers to kill his daughter
what means imperial caesar
what would you have me let the strumpet live that for this pageant earns so many deaths
exeunt tucca and pyrgus
pray jupiter we be not followed by the scent master
say sir what are you
i play vulcan sir
but what are you sir
your citizen and jeweller sir
and what are you dame
i play venus forsooth
i ask not what you play but what you are
your citizen and jeweller's wife sir
and you good sir
o that profaned name
and are these seemly company for thee to julia
all the rest i know and hate all knowledge for their hateful sakes
are you that first the deities inspired with skill of their high natures and their powers the first abusers of their useful light profaning thus their dignities in their forms and making them like you but counterfeits
o who shall follow virtue and embrace her when her false bosom is found nought but air
and yet of those embraces centaurs spring that war with human peace and poison men
who shall with greater comforts comprehend her unseen being and her excellence when you that teach and should eternise her live as she were no law unto your lives nor lived herself but with your idle breaths
if you think gods but feign'd and virtue painted know we sustain an actual residence and with the title of an emperor retain his spirit and imperial power by which in imposition too remiss licentious naso for thy violent wrong in soothing the declined affections of our base daughter we exile thy feet from all approach to our imperial court on pain of death and thy misgotten love commit to patronage of iron doors since her soft hearted sire cannot contain her
your gentleman parcel poet sir
o good my lord forgive
be like the gods
let royal bounty caesar mediate
there is no bounty to be shew'd to such as have no real goodness bounty is a spice of virtue and what virtuous act can take effect on them that have no power of equal habitude to apprehend it but live in worship of that idol vice as if there were no virtue but in shade of strong imagination merely enforced
this shews their knowledge is mere ignorance their far fetch'd dignity of soul a fancy and all their square pretext of gravity a mere vain glory hence away with them
i will prefer for knowledge none but such as rule their lives by it and can becalm all sea of humour with the marble trident of their strong spirits others fight below with gnats and shadows others nothing know
a street before the palace
what's become of my little punk venus and the poultfoot stinkard her husband ha
o they are rid home in the coach as fast as the wheels can run
god jupiter is banished i hear and his cockatrice juno lock'd up
'heart an all the poetry in parnassus get me to be a player again i'll sell 'em my share for a sesterce
but this is humours horace that goat footed envious slave he's turn'd fawn now an informer the rogue
'tis he has betray'd us all
did you not see him with the emperor crouching
thou shalt libel and i'll cudgel the rascal
boy provide me a truncheon
revenge shall gratulate him tam marti quam mercurio
ay but master take heed how you give this out horace is a man of the sword
'tis true in troth they say he's valiant
horace passes over the stage
so is mine a
i'll blow him into air when i meet him next he dares not fight with a puck fist
jupiter save thee my good poet my noble prophet my little fat horace
i scorn to beat the rogue in the court and i saluted him thus fair because he should suspect nothing the rascal
come we'll go see how far forward our journeyman is toward the untrussing of him
do you hear captain
i'll write nothing in it but innocence because i may swear i am innocent
nay why pursue you not the emperor for your reward now lupus
stay asinius you and your stager and your band of lictors i hope your service merits more respect than thus without a thanks to be sent hence
well well jest on jest on
thou base unworthy groom
ay ay 'tis good
was this the treason this the dangerous plot thy clamorous tongue so bellow'd through the court
hadst thou no other project to encrease thy grace with caesar but this wolfish train to prey upon the life of innocent mirth and harmless pleasures bred of noble wit
i loath thy presence such as thou they are the moths and scarabs of a state the bane of empires and the dregs of courts who to endear themselves to an employment care not whose fame they blast whose life they endanger and under a disguised and cobweb mask of love unto their sovereign vomit forth their own prodigious malice and pretending to be the props and columns of their safety the guards unto his person and his peace
disturb it most with their false lapwing cries
caesar shall know of this believe it
caesar doth know it wolf and to his knowledge he will i hope reward your base endeavours
princes that will but hear or give access to such officious spies can ne'er be safe they take in poison with an open ear and free from danger become slaves to fear
an open space before the palace
enter banish'd the court
let me be banish'd life since the chief end of life is there concluded within the court is all the kingdom bounded and as her sacred sphere doth comprehend ten thousand times so much as so much place in any part of all the empire else so every body moving in her sphere contains ten thousand times as much in him as any other her choice orb excludes
as in a circle a magician then is safe against the spirit he excites but out of it is subject to his rage and loseth all the virtue of his art so i exiled the circle of the court lose all the good gifts that in it i 'joy'd
no virtue current is but with her stamp and no vice vicious blanch'd with her white hand
the court's the abstract of all rome's desert and my dear julia the abstract of the court
methinks now i come near her i respire some air of that late comfort i received and while the evening with her modest veil gives leave to such poor shadows as myself to steal abroad i like a heartless ghost without the living body of my love will here walk and attend her for i know not far from hence she is imprisoned and hopes of her strict guardian to bribe so much admittance as to speak to me and cheer my fainting spirits with her breath
appears above at her chamber window
o how that word doth play with both our fortunes differing like ourselves both one and yet divided as opposed
i high thou low o this our plight of place doubly presents the two lets of our love local and ceremonial height and lowness both ways i am too high and thou too low our minds are even yet o why should our bodies that are their slaves be so without their rule
i'll cast myself down to thee if i die i'll ever live with thee no height of birth of place of duty or of cruel power shall keep me from thee should my father lock this body up within a tomb of brass yet i'll be with thee
if the forms i hold now in my soul be made one substance with it that soul immortal and the same 'tis now death cannot raze the affects she now retaineth and then may she be any where she will
the souls of parents rule not children's souls when death sets both in their dissolv'd estates then is no child nor father then eternity frees all from any temporal respect
i come my ovid take me in thine arms and let me breathe my soul into thy breast
o stay my love the hopes thou dost conceive of thy quick death and of thy future life are not authentical
thou choosest death so thou might'st 'joy thy love in the other life but know my princely love when thou art dead thou only must survive in perfect soul and in the soul are no affections
we pour out our affections with our blood and with our blood's affections fade our loves
no life hath love in such sweet state as this no essence is so dear to moody sense as flesh and blood whose quintessence is sense
beauty composed of blood and flesh moves more and is more plausible to blood and flesh than spiritual beauty can be to the spirit
such apprehension as we have in dreams when sleep the bond of senses locks them up such shall we have when death destroys them quite
if love be then thy object change not life live high and happy still i still below close with my fortunes in thy height shall joy
ay me that virtue whose brave eagle's wings with every stroke blow stairs in burning heaven should like a swallow preying towards storms fly close to earth and with an eager plume pursue those objects which none else can see but seem to all the world the empty air
thus thou poor ovid and all virtuous men must prey like swallows on invisible food pursuing flies or nothing and thus love
and every worldly fancy is transposed by worldly tyranny to what plight it list
o father since thou gav'st me not my mind strive not to rule it take but what thou gav'st to thy disposure thy affections rule not in me i must bear all my griefs let me use all my pleasures virtuous love was never scandal to a goddess' state
and my dear love thy life may chance be shorten'd by the length of my unwilling speeches to depart
farewell sweet life though thou be yet exiled the officious court enjoy me amply still my soul in this my breath enters thine ears and on this turret's floor will i lie dead till we may meet again in this proud height i kneel beneath thee in my prostrate love and kiss the happy sands that kiss thy feet
great jove submits a sceptre to a cell and lovers ere they part will meet in hell
farewell all company and if l could all light with thee
hell's shade should hide my brows till thy dear beauty's beams redeem'd my vows
ovid my love alas
may we not stay
a little longer think'st thou undiscern'd
for thine own good fair goddess do not stay
who would engage a firmament of fires shining in thee for me a falling star
be gone sweet life blood if i should discern thyself but touch'd for my sake i should die
i will begone then and not heaven itself shall draw me back
yet julia if thou wilt a little longer stay
what the sway of heaven could not retire my breath hath turned back
who shall go first my love
my passionate eyes will not endure to see thee turn from me
if thou go first my soul will follow thee
then we must stay
ay me there is no stay in amorous pleasures if both stay both die
i hear thy father hence my deity
julia retires from the window
fear forgeth sounds in my deluded ears i did not hear him i am mad with love
there is no spirit under heaven that works with such illusion yet such witchcraft kill me ere a sound mind without it save my life
here on my knees i worship the blest place that held my goddess and the loving air that closed her body in his silken arms
kneel not to the place nor air she's in thy heart rise then and worship there
the truest wisdom silly men can have is dotage on the follies of their flesh
v an apartment in the palace
enter and equites romani
we that have conquer'd still to save the conquer'd and loved to make inflictions fear'd not felt grieved to reprove and joyful to reward more proud of reconcilement than revenge resume into the late state of our love worthy cornelius gallus and tibullus you both are gentlemen and you cornelius a soldier of renown and the first provost that ever let our roman eagles fly on swarthy aegypt quarried with her spoils
yet not to bear cold forms nor men's out terms without the inward fires and lives of men you both have virtues shining through your shapes to shew your titles are not writ on posts or hollow statues which the best men are without promethean stuffings reach'd from heaven
sweet poesy's sacred garlands crown your gentry which is of all the faculties on earth the most abstract and perfect if she be true born and nursed with all the sciences
she can so mould rome and her monuments within the liquid marble of her lines that they shall stand fresh and miraculous even when they mix with innovating dust in her sweet streams shall our brave roman spirits chase and swim after death with their choice deeds shining on their white shoulders and therein shall tyber and our famous rivers fall with such attraction that the ambitious line of the round world shall to her centre shrink to hear their music and for these high parts caesar shall reverence the pierian arts
your majesty's high grace to poesy shall stand 'gainst all the dull detractions of leaden souls who for the vain assumings of some quite worthless of her sovereign wreaths contain her worthiest prophets in contempt
happy is rome of all earth's other states to have so true and great a president for her inferior spirits to imitate as caesar is who addeth to the sun influence and lustre in increasing thus his inspirations kindling fire in us
phoebus himself shall kneel at caesar's shrine and deck it with bay garlands dew'd with wine to quit the worship caesar does to him where other princes hoisted to their thrones by fortune's passionate and disorder'd power sit in their height like clouds before the sun hindering his comforts and by their excess of cold in virtue and cross heat in vice thunder and tempest on those learned heads whom caesar with such honour doth advance
all human business fortune doth command without all order and with her blind hand she blind bestows blind gifts that still have nurst they see not who nor how but still the worst
caesar for his rule and for so much stuff as fortune puts in his hand shall dispose it as if his hand had eyes and soul in it with worth and judgment
hands that part with gifts or will restrain their use without desert or with a misery numb'd to virtue's right work as they had no soul to govern them and quite reject her severing their estates from human order
whosoever can and will not cherish virtue is no man
enter some of the equestrian order
virgil is now at hand imperial caesar
rome's honour is at hand then
fetch a chair and set it on our right hand where 'tis fit rome's honour and our own should ever sit
now he is come out of campania i doubt not he hath finish'd all his aeneids
which like another soul i long to enjoy
what think you three of virgil gentlemen that are of his profession though rank'd higher or horace what say'st thou that art the poorest and likeliest to envy or to detract hor
caesar speaks after common men in this to make a difference of me for my poorness as if the filth of poverty sunk as deep into a knowing spirit as the bane of riches doth into an ignorant soul
no caesar they be pathless moorish minds that being once made rotten with the dung of damned riches ever after sink beneath the steps of any villainy
but knowledge is the nectar that keeps sweet a perfect soul even in this grave of sin and for my soul it is as free as caesar's for what know is due i'll give to all
he that detracts or envies virtuous merit is still the covetous and the ignorant spirit
thanks horace for thy free and wholesome sharpness which pleaseth caesar more than servile fawns
a flatter'd prince soon turns the prince of fools
and for thy sake we'll put no difference more between the great and good for being poor
say then loved horace thy true thought of virgil
i judge him of a rectified spirit by many revolutions of discourse in his bright reason's influence refined from all the tartarous moods of common men bearing the nature and similitude of a right heavenly body most severe in fashion and collection of himself and then as clear and confident as jove
and yet so chaste and tender is his ear in suffering any syllable to pass that he thinks may become the honour'd name of issue to his so examined self that all the lasting fruits of his full merit in his own poems he doth still distaste and if his mind's piece which he strove to paint could not with fleshly pencils have her right
but to approve his works of sovereign worth this observation methinks more than serves and is not vulgar
that which he hath writ is with such judgment labour'd and distill'd through all the needful uses of our lives that could a man remember but his lines he should not touch at any serious point but he might breathe his spirit out of him
you mean he might repeat part of his works as fit for any conference he can use
worthily observed and a most worthy virtue in his works
what thinks material horace of his learning
his learning savours not the school like gloss that most consists in echoing words and terms and soonest wins a man an empty name nor any long or far fetch'd circumstance wrapp'd in the curious generalities of arts but a direct and analytic sum of all the worth and first effects of arts
and for his poesy 'tis so ramm'd with life that it shall gather strength of life with being and live hereafter more admired than now
this one consent in all your dooms of him and mutual loves of all your several merits argues a truth of merit in you all
enter see here comes virgil we will rise and greet him
welcome to caesar virgil
caesar and virgil shall differ but in sound to caesar virgil of his expressed greatness shall be made a second sirname and to virgil caesar
where are thy famous aeneids
do us grace to let us see and surfeit on their sight
worthless they are of caesar's gracious eyes if they were perfect much more with their wants which are yet more than my time could supply
and could great caesar's expectation be satisfied with any other service i would not shew them
virgil is too modest or seeks in vain to make our longings more shew them sweet virgil
then in such due fear as fits presenters of great works to caesar i humbly shew them
let us now behold a human soul made visible in life and more refulgent in a senseless paper than in the sensual complement of kings
read read thyself dear virgil let not me profane one accent with an untuned tongue best matter badly shewn shews worse than bad
see then this chair of purpose set for thee to read thy poem in refuse it not
virtue without presumption place may take above best kings whom only she should make
it will be thought a thing ridiculous to present eyes and to all future times a gross untruth that any poet void of birth or wealth or temporal dignity should with decorum transcend caesar's chair
poor virtue raised high birth and wealth set under crosseth heaven's courses and makes worldlings wonder
the course of heaven and fate itself in this will ceasar cross much more all worldly custom
custom in course of honour ever errs and they are best whom fortune least prefers
horace hath but more strictly spoke our thoughts
the vast rude swing of general confluence is in particular ends exempt from sense and therefore reason which in right should be the special rector of all harmony shall shew we are a man distinct by it from those whom custom rapteth in her press
ascend then virgil and where first by chance we here have turn'd thy book do thou first read
great caesar hath his will i will ascend
'twere simple injury to his free hand that sweeps the cobwebs from unused virtue and makes her shine proportion'd to her worth to be more nice to entertain his grace than he is choice and liberal to afford it
gentlemen of our chamber guard the doors and let none enter exeunt equites
meanwhile the skies 'gan thunder and in tail of that fell pouring storms of sleet and hail the tyrian lords and trojan youth each where with venus' dardane nephew now in fear seek out for several shelter through the plain whilst floods come rolling from the hills amain
dido a cave the trojan prince the same lighted upon
there earth and heaven's great dame that hath the charge of marriage first gave sign unto his contract fire and air did shine as guilty of the match and from the hill the nymphs with shriekings do the region fill
here first began their bane this day was ground of all their ills for now nor rumour's sound nor nice respect of state moves dido ought her love no longer now by stealth is sought she calls this wedlock and with that fair name covers her fault
forthwith the bruit and fame through all the greatest lybian towns is gone fame a fleet evil than which is swifter none that moving grows and flying gathers strength little at first and fearful but at length she dares attempt the skies and stalking proud with feet on ground her head doth pierce a cloud
this child our parent earth stirr'd up with spite of all the gods brought forth and as some write she was last sister of that giant race that thought to scale jove' s court right swift of pace and swifter far of wing a monster vast and dreadful
look how many plumes are placed on her huge corps so many waking eyes stick underneath and which may stranger rise in the report as many tongues she bears as many mouths as many listening ears
nightly in midst of all the heaven she flies and through the earth's dark shadow shrieking cries nor do her eyes once bend to taste sweet sleep by day on tops of houses she doth keep or on high towers and doth thence affright cities and towns of most conspicuous site as covetous she is of tales and lies as prodigal of truth this monster lup
come follow me assist me second me
sir you must pardon us
caesar is private now you may not enter
charge them upon their allegiance cropshin
we have a charge to the contrary sir
i pronounce you all traitors horrible traitors what
do you know my affairs
i have matter of danger and state to impart to caesar
what noise is there
who's that names caesar
a friend to caesar
one that for caesar's good would speak with caesar
o bid the turbulent informer hence we have no vacant ear now to receive the unseason'd fruits of his officious tongue
you must avoid him there
i conjure thee as thou art
caesar or respectest thine own safety or the safety of the state caesar hear me speak with me caesar 'tis no common business i come about but such as being neglected may concern the life of caesar
the life of caesar
virgil keep thy seat
enter lupus tucca and lictors
bear back there whither will you
by thy leave goodman usher mend thy peruke so
lay hold on horace there and on mecaenas lictors
romans offer no rescue upon your allegiance read royal caesar
i'll tickle you satyr
he will humours he will he will squeeze you poet puck fist
i'll lop you off for an unprofitable branch you satirical varlet
ay and epaminondas your patron here with his flagon chain come resign takes off mecaenas' chain though 'twere your great grandfather's the law has made it mine now sir
look to him my party coloured rascals look to him
what is this asinius lupus
i understand it not
a libel caesar a dangerous seditious libel a libel in picture
ay i found it in this horace his study in mecaenas his house here i challenge the penalty of the laws against them
ay and remember to beg their land betimes before some of these hungry court hounds scent it out
shew it to horace ask him if he know it
his hand is at it caesar
then 'tis no libel
it is the imperfect body of an emblem caesar i began for mecaenas
right that's greek for a libel
do but mark how confident he is
a just man cannot fear thou foolish tribune not though the malice of traducing tongues the open vastness of a tyrant's ear the senseless rigour of the wrested laws or the red eyes of strain'd authority should in a point meet all to take his life his innocence is armour 'gainst all these
let me see let me see
is not here an eagle
and is not that eagle meant by caesar ha
does not caesar give the eagle
answer me what sayest thou
hast thou any evasion stinkard
now he's turn'd dumb
i'll tickle you satyr
dost thou pish me
give me my long sword
with reverence to great caesar worthy romans observe but this ridiculous commenter the soul 'to my device was in this distich thus oft the base and ravenous multitude survive to share the spoils of fortitude
which in this body i have figured here a vulture lup
ay now 'tis a vulture
has not your vulture a beak
has it not legs and talons and wings and feathers
touch him old buskins
and therefore must it be an eagle
respect him not good horace say your device
a vulture and a wolf lup
good that's i i am the wolf my name's lupus i am meant by the wolf
on on a vulture and a wolf hor
preying upon the carcass of an ass lup
good still that's i too i am the ass
you mean me by the ass
prithee leave braying then
if you will needs take it i cannot with modesty give it from you
but by that beast the old egyptians were wont to figure in their hieroglyphics patience frugality and fortitude for none of which we can suspect you tribune
who was it lupus that inform'd you first this should be meant by us
or was't your comment
no caesar a player gave me the first light of it indeed
ay an honest sycophant like slave and a politician besides caes
where is that player
he is without here
call in the player there master aesop call him
where is the player
bear back none but the player enter
enter followed by and tuc
yes this gentleman and his achates must
pray you master usher we'll stand close here
'tis a gentleman of quality this though he be somewhat out of clothes i tell ye
come aesop hast a bay leaf in thy mouth
well said be not out stinkard
thou shalt have a monopoly of playing confirm'd to thee and thy covey under the emperor's broad seal for this service
ay caesar this is he
let him be whipped
lictors go take him hence
and lupus for your fierce credulity one fit him with a pair of larger ears 'tis caesar's doom and must not be revoked
we hate to have our court and peace disturb'd with these quotidian clamours
exeunt some of the lictors with lupus and aesop caes
gag him that we may have his silence
caesar hath done like caesar
fair and just is his award against these brainless creatures
'tis not the wholesome sharp morality or modest anger of a satiric spirit that hurts or wounds the body of the state but the sinister application of the malicious ignorant and base interpreter who will distort and strain the general scope and purpose of an author to his particular and private spleen
we know it our dear virgil and esteem it a most dishonest practice in that man will seem too witty in another's work
what would cornelius gallus and tibullus
nay but as thou art a man dost hear
a man of worship and honourable hold here take thy chain again
dost thou think i meant to have kept it old boy
no i did it but to fright thee i to try how thou would'st take it
will i turn shark upon my friends or my friends' friends
i scorn it with my three souls
come i love bully horace as well as thou dost i 'tis an honest hieroglyphic
give me thy wrist helicon
dost thou think i'll second e'er a rhinoceros of them all against thee ha
or thy noble hippocrene here
i'll turn stager first and be whipt too dost thou see bully
you have your will of caesar use it romans
virgil shall be your praetor and ourself will here sit by spectator of your sports and think it no impeach of royalty
our ear is now too much profaned grave maro with these distastes to take thy sacred lines put up thy book till both the time and we be fitted with more hallow'd circumstance for the receiving of so divine a work
proceed with your design
thanks to great caesar
tibullus draw you the indictment then whilst horace arrests them on the statute of calumny
mecaenas and i will take our places here
i am the worst accuser under heaven
tut you must do it 'twill be noble mirth
i take no knowledge that they do malign me
ay but the world takes knowledge
would the world knew how heartily i wish a fool should hate me
will they arraign my brisk poetaster and his poor journeyman ha
would i were abroad skeldering for a drachm so i were out of this labyrinth again
i do feel myself turn stinkard already but i must set the best face i have upon't now
well said my divine deft horace bring the whoreson detracting slaves to the bar do make them hold up their spread golls i'll give in evidence for thee if thou wilt
take courage crlspinus would thy man had a clean band
what must we do captain
thou shalt see anon do not make division with thy legs so
i only know him for a motion caesar
i am one of thy commanders caesar a man of service and action my name is pantilius tucca i have served in thy wars against mark antony caes
do you know him cornelius
he's one that hath had the mustering or convoy of a company now and then i never noted him by any other employment
we will observe him better
lictor proclaim silence in the court
in the name of caesar silence
let the parties the accuser and the accused present themselves
the accuser and the accused present yourselves in court
rufus laberius crispinus and demetrius fannius hold up your hands
you are before this time jointly and severally indicted and here presently to be arraigned upon the statute of calumny or lex remmia the one by the name of rufus laberius crispinus alias cri spinus poetaster and plagiary the other by the name of demetrius fannius play dresser and plagiary
that you not having the fear of phoebus or his shafts before your eyes contrary to the peace of our liege lord augustus caesar his crown and dignity and against the form of a statute in that case made and provided have moat ignorantly foolishly and more like yourselves maliciously gone about to deprave and calumniate the person and writings of quintus horatius flaccus here present poet and priest to the muses and to that end have mutually conspired and plotted at sundry times as by several means and in sundry places for the better accomplishing your base and envious purpose taxing him falsely of self love arrogancy impudence railing filching by translation etc
of all which calumnies and every of them in manner and form aforesaid what answer you
are you guilty or not guilty
how will you be tried
by the roman gods and the noblest romans
by the roman gods and the noblest romans
here sits mecaenas and cornelius gallus are you contented to be tried by these
ay so the noble captain may be joined with them in commission say
ay so the noble captain may be joined with them in commission
what says the plaintiff
captain then take your place
alas my worshipful praetor
'tis more of thy gentleness than of my deserving i wusse
but since it hath pleased the court to make choice of my wisdom and gravity come my calumnious varlets let's hear you talk for yourselves now an hour or two
what can you say
stay turn and take an oath first
you shall swear by thunder darting jove the king of gods and by the genius of augustus caesar by your own white and uncorrupted souls and the deep reverence of our roman justice to judge this case with truth and equity as bound by your religion and your laws
now read the evidence but first demand of either prisoner if that writ be theirs
gives him two papers
shew this unto crispinus
dost thou stand upon it pimp
do not deny thine own minerva thy pallas the issue of thy brain
yes it is mine
shew that unto demetrius
there's a father will not deny his own bastard now i warrant thee
ramp up my genius be not retrograde but boldly nominate a spade a spade what shall thy lubrical and glibbery muse live as she were defunct like punk in stews
that were no modern consequence to have cothurnal buskins frighted hence
no teach thy incubus to poetise and throw abroad thy spurious snotteries upon that puft up lump of balmy froth
or clumsy chilblain'd judgment that with oath magnificates his merit and beapawls the conscious time with humorous foam and brawls as if his organons of sense would crack the sinews of my patience
break his back o poets all and some
for now we list of strenuous vengeance to clutch the fist
ay marry this was written like a hercules in poetry now
and as strangely worded caesar
this is a fellow of a good prodigal tongue too this will do well
our muse is in mind for th' untrussing a poet i slip by his name for most men do know it a critic that all the world bescumbers with satirical humours and lyrical numbers tuc
art thou there boy
and for the most part himself doth advance with much self love and more arrogance
and but that i would not be thought a prater i could tell you he were a translator
i know the authors from whence he has stole and could trace him too but that i understand them not full and whole
that line is broke loose from all his fellows chain him up shorter do
the best note i can give you to know him by is that he keeps gallants' company whom i could wish in time should him fear lest after they buy repentance too dear
this carries palm with it
and why thou motley gull why should they fear
when hast thou known us wrong or tax a friend
i dare thy malice to betray it
now thou curl'st up thou poor and nasty snake and shrink'st thy poisonous head into thy bosom out viper
thou that eat'st thy parents hence
rather such speckled creatures as thyself should be eschew'd and shunn'd such as will bite and gnaw their absent friends not cure their fame catch at the loosest laughters and affect to be thought jesters such as can devise things never seen or head t'impair men's names and gratify their credulous adversaries will carry tales do basest offices cherish divided fires and still encrease new flames out of old embers will reveal each secret that's committed to their trust these be black slaves romans take heed of these
thou twang'st right little horace they be indeed a couple of chap fall'n curs
come we of the bench let's rise to the urn and condemn them quickly
before you go together worthy romans we are to tender our opinion and give you those instructions that may add unto your even judgment in the cause which thus we do commence
first you must know that where there is a true and perfect merit there can be no dejection and the scorn of humble baseness oftentimes so works in a high soul upon the grosser spirit that to his bleared and offended sense there seems a hideous fault blazed in the object when only the disease is in his eyes
here hence it comes our horace now stands tax'd of impudence self love and arrogance by those who share no merit in themselves and therefore think his portion is as small
for they from their own guilt assure their souls if they should confidently praise their works in them it would appear inflation which in a full and well digested man cannot receive that foul abusive name but the fair title of erection
and for his true use of translating men it still hath been a work of as much palm in clearest judgments as to invent or make his sharpness that is most excusable as being forced out of a suffering virtue oppressed with the license of the time and howsoever fools or jerking pedants players or suchlike buffoon barking wits may with their beggarly and barren trash tickle base vulgar ears in their despite this like jove's thunder shall their pride control "the honest satire hath the happiest soul
" now romans you have heard our thoughts withdraw when you please
remove the accused from the bar
who holds the urn to us ha
fear nothing i'll quit you mine honest pitiful stinkards i'll do't
captain you shall eternally girt me to you as i am generous
tibullus let there be a case of vizards privately provided we have found a subject to bestow them on
it shall be done caesar
here be words horace able to bastinado a man's ears
please it great caesar i have pills about me mixt with the whitest kind of hellebore would give him a light vomit that should purge his brain and stomach of those tumorous heats might i have leave to minister unto him
o be his aesculapius gentle horace
you shall have leave and he shall be your patient
virgil use your authority command him forth
caesar is careful of your health crispinus and hath himself chose a physician to minister unto you take his pills
they are somewhat bitter sir but very wholesome
take yet another so stand by they'll work anon
romans return to your several seats lictors bring forward the urn and set the accused to the bar
quickly you whoreson egregious varlets come forward
shall we sit all day upon you
you make no more haste now than a beggar upon pattens or a physician to a patient that has no money you pilchers
rufus laberius crispinus and demetrius fannius hold up your hands
you have according to the roman custom put yourselves upon trial to the urn for divers and sundry calumnies whereof you have before this time been indicted and are now presently arraigned prepare yourselves to hearken to the verdict of your tryers
caius cilnius mecaenas pronounceth you by this hand writing guilty
he means himself for it was he indeed suborn'd us to the calumny
i you whoreson cantharides
i appeal to your conscience captain
then you confess it now
i do and crave the mercy of the court
o the captain the captain bor
my physic begins to work with my patient i see
captain stand forth and answer
hold thy peace poet praetor i appeal from thee to caesar do me right royal caesar
marry and i will sir
lictors gag him do
and put a case of vizards o'er his head that he may look bifronted as he speaks
thou wilt not caesar wilt thou
away you whoreson vultures away
you think i am a dead corps now because caesar is disposed to jest with a man of mark or so
hold your hook'd talons out of my flesh you inhuman harpies
will the royal augustus cast away a gentleman of worship a captain and a commander for a couple of condemn'd caitiff calumnious cargos
the vizards are put upon him
demand what cause they had to malign horace
in troth no great cause not i i must confess but that he kept better company for the most part than i and that better men loved him than loved me and that his writings thrived better than mine and were better liked and graced nothing else
thus envious souls repine at others' good
if this be all faith i forgive thee freely
envy me still so long as virgil loves me gallus tibullus and the best best caesar my dear mecaenas while these with many more whose names i wisely slip shall think me worthy their honour'd and adored society and read and love prove and applaud my poems i would not wish but such as you should spite them
o i am sick
a bason a bason quickly our physic works
o retrograde reciprocal incubus
retrograde reciprocal and incubus are come up
thanks be to jupiter
o glibbery lubrical defunct o
well said here's some store
glibbery lubrical and defunct
o they came up easy
that came up somewhat hard
i shall cast up my spurious snotteries hor
chilblain'd o o clumsie hor
that clumsie stuck terribly
what's all that horace
spurious snotteries chilblain'd clumsie
who would have thought there should have been such a deal of filth in a poet
o balmy froth caes
puffie inflate turgidious ventosity
balmy froth puffie inflate turgidous and ventosity are come up
o terrible windy words
a sign of a windy brain
o oblatrant furibund fatuate strenuous hor
here's a deal oblatrant furibund fatuate strenuous
now all's come up i trow
what a tumult he had in his belly
no there's the often conscious damp behind still
it is come up thanks to apollo and aesculapius another you were best take a pill more
o no o o o o hor
force yourself then a little with your finger
prorumped i what a noise it made
as if his spirit would have prorumpt with it
help him it sticks strangely whatever it is
now it is come clutcht
it is well that's come up it had but a narrow passage
hold him hold his head there
snarling gusts quaking custard
nay that are all we i assure you
how do you feel yourself
pretty and well i thank you
these pills can but restore him for a time not cure him quite of such a malady caught by so many surfeits which have fill'd his blood and brain thus full of crudities 'tis necessary therefore he observe a strict and wholesome diet
look you take each morning of old cato's principles a good draught next your heart that walk upon till it be well digested then come home and taste a piece of terence suck his phrase instead of liquorice and at any hand shun plautus and old ennius they are meats too harsh for a weak stomach
use to read but not without a tutor the best greeks as orpheus musaeus pindarus hesiod callimachus and theocrite high homer but beware of lycophron he is too dark and dangerous a dish
you must not hunt for wild outlandish terms to stuff out a peculiar dialect but let your matter run before your words
and if at any time you chance to meet some gallo belgic phrase you shall not straight
rack your poor verse to give it entertainment but let it pass and do not think yourself much damnified if you do leave it out when nor your understanding nor the sense could well receive it
this fair abstinence in time will render you more sound and clear and this have i prescribed to you in place of a strict sentence which till he perform attire him in that robe
and henceforth learn to bear yourself more humbly not to swell or breathe your insolent and idle spite on him whose laughter can your worst affright
and for a week or two see him lock'd up in some dark place removed from company he will talk idly else after his physic
now to you sir
the extremity of law awards you to be branded in the front for this your calumny but since it pleaseth horace the party wrong'd t' intreat of caesar a mitigation of that juster doom with caesar's tongue thus we pronounce your sentence
demetrius fannius thou shalt here put on that coat and cap and henceforth think thyself no other than they make thee vow to wear them in every fair and generous assembly till the best sort of minds shall take to knowledge as well thy satisfaction as thy wrongs
only grave praetor here in open court i crave the oath for good behaviour may be administer'd unto them both
horace it shall tibullus give it them
rufus laberius crispinus and demetrius fannius lay your hands on your hearts
you shall here solemnly attest and swear that never after this instant either at booksellers' stalls in taverns two penny rooms tyring houses noblemen's butteries puisents chambers the best and farthest places where you are admitted to come you shall once offer or dare thereby to endear yourself the more to any player enghle or guilty gull in your company to malign traduce or detract the person or writings of quintus horatius flaccus or any other eminent men transcending you in merit whom your envy shall find cause to work upon either for that or for keeping himself in better acquaintance or enjoying better friends or if transported by any sudden and desperate resolution you do that then you shall not under the batoon or in the next presence being an honourable assembly of his favourers be brought as voluntary gentlemen to undertake the for swearing of it
neither shall you at any time ambitiously affecting the title of the untrussers or whippers of the age suffer the itch of writing to over run your performance in libel upon pain of being taken up for lepers in wit and losing both your time and your papers be irrecoverably forfeited to the hospital of fools
so help you our roman gods and the genius of great caesar
now dissolve the court
and thanks to caesar that thus hath exercised his patience
we have indeed you worthiest friends of caesar
it is the bane and torment of our ears to hear the discords of those jangling rhymers that with their bad and scandalous practices bring all true arts and learning in contempt
but let not your high thoughts descend so low as these despised objects let them fall with their flat grovelling souls be you yourselves and as with our best favours you stand crown'd so let your mutual loves be still renown'd
envy will dwell where there is want of merit though the deserving man should crack his spirit

"here reader in place of the epilogue was meant to thee an apology from the author with his reasons for the publishing of this book but since he is no less restrained than thou deprived of it by authority he prays thee to think charitably of what thou hast read
till thou mayest hear him speak what he hath written
there are to whom i seem excessive sour and past a satire's law t' extend my power others that think whatever i have writ wants pith and matter to eternise it and that they could in one day's light disclose a thousand verses such as i compose
what shall i do trebatius
and shall my muse admit no more increase
an ill death let me die if 'twere not best but sleep avoids mine eye and i use these lest nights should tedious seem
rather contend to sleep and live like them that holding golden sleep in special price rubb'd with sweet oils swim silver tyber thrice and every even with neat wine steeped be or if such love of writing ravish thee then dare to sing unconquer'd caesar's deeds who cheers such actions with abundant meeds
that father i desire but when i try i feel defects in every faculty nor is't a labour fit for every pen to paint the horrid troops of armed men the lances burst in gallia's slaughter'd forces or wounded parthians tumbled from their horses great caesar's wars cannot be fought with words
yet what his virtue in his peace affords his fortitude and justice thou canst shew as wise lucilius honour'd scipio
of that my powers shall suffer no neglect when such slight labours may aspire respect but if i watch not a most chosen time the humble words of flaccus cannot climb th' attentive ear of caesar nor must i with less observance shun gross flattery for he reposed safe in his own merit spurns back the gloses of a fawning spirit
but how much better would such accents sound than with a sad and serious verse to wound pantolabus railing in his saucy jests or nomentanus spent in riotous feasts
in satires each man though untouch'd complains as he were hurt and hates such biting strains
what shall i do
milonius shakes his heels in ceaseless dances when his brain once feels the stirring fervour of the wine ascend and that his eyes false numbers apprehend
castor his horse pollux loves handy fights a thousand heads a thousand choice delights
my pleasure is in feet my words to close as both our better old lucilius does he as his trusty friends his books did trust with all his secrets nor in things unjust or actions lawful ran to other men so that the old man's life described was seen as in a votive table in his lines and to his steps my genius inclines lucanian or apulian i know not whether for the venusian colony ploughs either sent thither when the sabines were forced thence as old fame sings to give the place defence 'gainst such as seeing it empty might make road upon the empire or there fix abode whether the apulian borderer it were or the lucanian violence they fear
but this my style no living man shall touch if first i be not forced by base reproach but like a sheathed sword it shall defend my innocent life for why should i contend to draw it out when no malicious thief robs my good name the treasure of my life
o jupiter let it with rust be eaten before it touch or insolently threaten the life of any with the least disease so much i love and woo a general peace
but he that wrongs me better i proclaim he never had assay'd to touch my fame
for he shall weep and walk with every tongue throughout the city infamously sung
servius the praetor threats the laws and urn if any at his deeds repine or spurn the witch canidia that albutius got denounceth witchcraft where she loveth not thurius the judge doth thunder worlds of ill to such as strive with his judicial will

but briefly if to age i destined be or that quick death's black wings environ me if rich or poor at rome or fate command i shall be banished to some other land what hue soever my whole state shall bear i will write satires still in spite of fear
horace i fear thou draw'st no lasting breath and that some great man's friend will be thy death
when the man that first did satirise durst pull the skin over the ears of vice and make who stood in outward fashion clear give place as foul within shall i forbear

rulers and subjects by whole tribes he checkt but virtue and her friends did still protect and when from sight or from the judgment seat the virtuous scipio and wise laelius met unbraced with him in all light sports they shared till their most frugal suppers were prepared
whate'er i am though both for wealth and wit beneath lucilius i am pleased to sit yet envy spite of her empoison'd breast shall say i lived in grace here with the best and seeking in weak trash to make her wound shall find me solid and her teeth unsound 'less learn'd trebatius' censure disagree
no horace i of force must yield to thee only take heed as being advised by me lest thou incur some danger better pause than rue thy ignorance of the sacred laws there's justice and great action may be sued 'gainst such as wrong men's fames with verses lewd
ay with lewd verses such as libels be and aim'd at persons of good quality i reverence and adore that just decree
but if they shall be sharp yet modest rhymes that spare men's persons and but tax their crimes such shall in open court find current pass were caesar judge and with the maker's grace
nay i'll add more if thou thyself being clear shall tax in person a man fit to bear shame and reproach his suit shall quickly be dissolved in laughter and thou thence set free
if by looking on what is past thou hast deserved that name i am willing thou should'st yet know more by that which follows an which was only once spoken upon the stage and all the answer i ever gave to sundry impotent libels then cast out and some yet remaining against me and this play
wherein i take no pleasure to revive the times but that posterity may make a difference between their manners that provoked me then and mine that neglected them ever for in these strifes and on such persons were as wretched to affect a victory as it is unhappy to be committed with them
non annorum canities est laudanda sed morum
i pray you let' s go see him how he looks after these libels
o vex'd vex'd i warrant you
do you think so
i should be sorry for him if i found that
o they are such bitter things he cannot choose
but is he guilty of them
we'll steal upon him or let's listen stay
he has a humour oft to talk t' himself
they are your manners lead me not mine own
they come forward the scene opens and discovers the author in his study
the fates have not spun him the coarsest thread that free from knots of perturbation doth yet so live although but to himself as he can safely scorn the tongues of slaves and neglect fortune more than she can him
it is the happiest thing this not to be within the reach of malice it provides a man so well to laugh off injuries and never sends him farther for his vengeance than the vex'd bosom of his enemy
i now but think how poor their spite sets off who after all their waste of sulphurous terms and burst out thunder of their charged mouths have nothing left but the unsavoury smoke of their black vomit to upbraid themselves whilst i at whom they shot sit here shot free and as unhurt of envy as unhit
ay but the multitude they think not so sir they think you hit and hurt and dare give out your silence argues it in not rejoining to this or that late libel
i can afford them leave to err so still and like the barking students of bears college to swallow up the garbage of the time with greedy gullets whilst myself sit by pleased and yet tortured with their beastly feeding
'tis a sweet madness runs along with them to think all that are aim'd at still are struck then where the shaft still lights make that the mark and so each fear or fever shaken fool may challenge teucer's hand in archery
good troth if i knew any man so vile to act the crimes these whippers reprehend or what their servile apes gesticulate i should not then much muse their shreds were liked since ill men have a lust t' hear others' sins all good men have a zeal to hear sin shamed
but when it is all excrement they vent base filth and offal or thefts notable as ocean piracies or highway stands and not a crime there tax'd but is their own or what their own foul thoughts suggested to them and that in all their heat of taxing others not one of them but lives himself if known improbior satiram scribente cinaedo what should i say more than turn stone with wonder
i never saw this play bred all this tumult what was there in it could so deeply offend and stir so many hornets
shall i tell you
then by the hope which i prefer unto all other objects i can profess i never writ that piece more innocent or empty of offence
some salt it had but neither tooth nor gall nor was there in it any circumstance which
in the setting down i could suspect might be perverted by an enemy's tongue only it had the fault to be call'd mine that was the crime
why they say you tax'd the law and lawyers captains and the players by their particular names
it is not so
i used no name
my books have still been taught to spare the persons and to speak the vices
these are mere slanders and enforced by such as have no safer ways to men's disgraces
but their own lies and loss of honesty fellows of practised and most laxative tongues whose empty and eager bellies in the year compel their brains to many desperate shifts i spare to name them for their wretchedness fury itself would pardon
these or such whether of malice or of ignorance or itch t' have me their adversary i know not or all these mixt but sure i am three years they did provoke me with their petulant styles on every stage and i at last unwilling but weary i confess of so much trouble thought i would try if shame could win upon 'em' and therefore chose augustus caesar's times when wit and area were at their height in rome to shew that virgil horace and the rest of those great master spirits did not want detractors then or practicers against them and by this line although no parallel i hoped at last they would sit down and blush but nothing i could find more contrary
and though the impudence of flies be great yet this hath so provok'd the angry wasps or as you said of the next nest the hornets that they fly buzzing mad about my nostrils and like so many screaming grasshoppers held by the wings fill every ear with noise
those former calumnies you mention'd
first of the law indeed i brought in ovid chid by his angry father for neglecting the study of their laws for poetry and i am warranted by his own words saepe pater dixit studium quid inutile tentas
maeonides nullas ipse reliquit opes
and in far harsher terms elsewhere as these non me verbosas leges ediscere non me ingrato voces prostituisse foro
but how this should relate unto our laws or the just ministers with least abuse i reverence both too much to understand
then for the captain i will only speak an epigram i here have made it is that's the lemma mark it
strength of my country whilst i bring to view such as are miss call'd captains and wrong you and your high names i do desire that thence be nor put on you nor you take offence i swear by your true friend my muse i love your great profession which i once did prove and did not shame it with my actions then no more than i dare now do with my pen
he that not trusts me having vowed thus much but's angry for the captain still is such
now for the players it is true i tax'd them and yet but some and those so sparingly as all the rest might have sat still unquestion'd had they but had the wit or conscience to think well of themselves
but impotent they thought each man's vice belong'd to their whole tribe and much good do't them
what they have done 'gainst me i am not moved with if it gave them meat or got them clothes 'tis well that was their end
only amongst them i am sorry for some better natures by the rest so drawn to run in that vile line
and is this all
will you not answer then the libels
it will be taken to be stupidity or tameness in you
but they that have incensed me can in soul acquit me of that guilt
they know i dare to spurn or baffle them or squirt their eyes with ink or urine or i could do worse arm'd with archilochus' fury write iambics should make the desperate lashers hang themselves rhime them to death as they do irish rats in drumming tunes
or living i could stamp their foreheads with those deep and public brands that the whole company of barber surgeon a should not take off with all their art and plasters
and these my prints should last still to be read in their pale fronts when what they write 'gainst me shall like a figure drawn in water fleet and the poor wretched papers be employed to clothe tobacco or some cheaper drug this i could do and make them infamous
but to what end
when their own deeds have mark'd 'em and that i know within his guilty breast each slanderer bears a whip that shall torment him worse than a million of these temporal plagues which to pursue were but a feminine humour and far beneath the dignity of man
'tis true for to revenge their injuries were to confess you felt them
let them go and use the treasure of the fool their tongues who makes his gain by speaking worst of beat
o but they lay particular imputations aut
that all your writing is mere railing
if all the salt in the old comedy should be so censured or the sharper wit of the bold satire termed scolding rage what age could then compare with those for buffoons
what should be said of aristophanes persius or juvenal whose names we now so glorify in schools at least pretend it
have they no other
yes they say you are slow and scarce bring forth a play a year
i would they could not say that i did that
there' s all the joy that i take in their trade unless such scribes as these might be proscribed th' abused theatres
they would think it strange now a man should take but colts foot for one day and between whiles spit out a better poem than e'er the master of art or giver of wit their belly made
yet this is possible if a free mind had but the patience to think so much together and so vile
but that these base and beggarly conceits should carry it by the multitude of voices against the most abstracted work opposed to the stuff'd nostrils of the drunken rout
o this would make a learn'd and liberal soul to rive his stained quill up to the back and damn his long watch'd labours to the fire things that were born when none but the still night and his dumb candle saw his pinching throes were not his own free merit a more crown unto his travails than their reeling claps
this 'tis that strikes me silent seals my lips and apts me rather to sleep out my time than i would waste it in contemned strifes with these vile ibides these unclean birds that make their mouths their clysters and still purge from their hot entrails
but i leave the monsters to their own fate
and since the comic muse hath proved so ominous to me i will try if have a more kind aspect her favours in my next i will pursue where if i prove the pleasure but of one so he judicious be he shall be alone a theatre unto me once i'll say to strike the ear of time in those fresh strains as shall beside the cunning of their ground give cause to some of wonder some despite and more despair to imitate their sound
i that spend half my nights and all my days here in a cell to get a dark paleface to come forth worth the ivy or the bays and in this age can hope no other grace leave me
there's something come into my thought that must and shall be sung high and aloof safe from the wolfs black jaw and the dun ass's hoof nas
i reverence these raptures and obey them
