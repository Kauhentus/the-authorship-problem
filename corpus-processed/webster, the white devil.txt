i i enter count lodovico antonelli and gasparo lodo
it griev'd me much to hear the sentence
ha ha o democritus thy gods that govern the whole world
courtly reward and punishment
fortune 's a right whore if she give aught she deals it in small parcels that she may take away all at one swoop
this 'tis to have great enemies
your wolf no longer seems to be a wolf than when she 's hungry
you term those enemies are men of princely rank
oh i pray for them the violent thunder is adored by those are pasht in pieces by it
come my lord you are justly doom'd look but a little back into your former life you have in three years ruin'd the noblest earldom
your followers have swallowed you like mummia and being sick with such unnatural and horrid physic vomit you up i' th' kennel
all the damnable degrees of drinking have you stagger'd through
one citizen is lord of two fair manors call'd you master only for caviare
those noblemen which were invited to your prodigal feasts wherein the phnix scarce could 'scape your throats laugh at your misery as fore deeming you an idle meteor which drawn forth the earth would be soon lost i' the air
jest upon you and say you were begotten in an earthquake you have ruin'd such fair lordships
this well goes with two buckets i must tend the pouring out of either
you have acted certain murders here in rome bloody and full of horror
'las they were flea bitings why took they not my head then
the law doth sometimes mediate thinks it good not ever to steep violent sins in blood this gentle penance may both end your crimes and in the example better these bad times
so but i wonder then some great men 'scape this banishment there 's paulo giordano ursini the duke of brachiano now lives in rome and by close panderism seeks to prostitute the honour of vittoria corombona vittoria she that might have got my pardon for one kiss to the duke
have a full man within you we see that trees bear no such pleasant fruit there where they grew first as where they are new set
perfumes the more they are chaf'd the more they render their pleasing scents and so affliction expresseth virtue fully whether true or else adulterate
leave your painted comforts i 'll make italian cut works in their guts if ever i return
i have seen some ready to be executed give pleasant looks and money and grown familiar with the knave hangman so do i i thank them and would account them nobly merciful would they dispatch me quickly
fare you well we shall find time i doubt not to repeal your banishment
i am ever bound to you
this is the world's alms pray make use of it
great men sell sheep thus to be cut in pieces when first they have shorn them bare and sold their fleeces
exeunt enter brachiano camillo flamineo vittoria brach
your best of rest
unto my lord the duke the best of welcome
more lights attend the duke
exeunt camillo and vittoria
pursue your noble wishes i am prompt as lightning to your service
the fair vittoria my happy sister shall give you present audience gentlemen whisper
let the caroch go on and 'tis his pleasure you put out all your torches and depart
are we so happy
can it be otherwise
observ'd you not to night my honour'd lord which way soe'er you went she threw her eyes
i have dealt already with her chambermaid zanche the moor and she is wondrous proud to be the agent for so high a spirit
we are happy above thought because 'bove merit
we may now talk freely 'bove merit
what is 't you doubt
that 's but the superficies of lust most women have yet why should ladies blush to hear that named which they do not fear to handle
oh they are politic they know our desire is increased by the difficulty of enjoying whereas satiety is a blunt weary and drowsy passion
if the buttery hatch at court stood continually open there would be nothing so passionate crowding nor hot suit after the beverage
oh but her jealous husband flam
hang him a gilder that hath his brains perished with quicksilver is not more cold in the liver
the great barriers moulted not more feathers than he hath shed hairs by the confession of his doctor
an irish gamester that will play himself naked and then wage all downward at hazard is not more venturous
so unable to please a woman that like a dutch doublet all his back is shrunk into his breaches
shroud you within this closet good my lord some trick now must be thought on to divide my brother in law from his fair bed fellow
oh should she fail to come flam
i must not have your lordship thus unwisely amorous
i myself have not loved a lady and pursued her with a great deal of under age protestation whom some three or four gallants that have enjoyed would with all their hearts have been glad to have been rid of
'tis just like a summer bird cage in a garden the birds that are without despair to get in and the birds that are within despair and are in a consumption for fear they shall never get out
away away my lord
exit brachiano as camillo enters
see here he comes
this fellow by his apparel some men would judge a politician but call his wit in question you shall find it merely an ass in 's foot cloth
what travelling to bed with your kind wife
i assure you brother no
my voyage lies more northerly in a far colder clime
i do not well remember i protest when i last lay with her
strange you should lose your count
we never lay together but ere morning there grew a flaw between us
had been your part to have made up that flaw
true but she loathes i should be seen in 't
why sir what 's the matter
the duke your master visits me i thank him and i perceive how like an earnest bowler he very passionately leans that way he should have his bowl run
i hope you do not think cam
that nobleman bowl booty
faith his cheek hath a most excellent bias it would fain jump with my mistress
will you be an ass despite your aristotle
or a cuckold contrary to your ephemerides which shows you under what a smiling planet you were first swaddled
pew wew sir tell me not of planets nor of ephemerides
a man may be made cuckold in the day time when the stars' eyes are out
sir good bye you i do commit you to your pitiful pillow stuffed with horn shavings
might i advise you now your only course were to lock up your wife
bar her the sight of revels
let her not go to church but like a hound in leon at your heels
'twere for her honour
and so you should be certain in one fortnight despite her chastity or innocence to be cuckolded which yet is in suspense this is my counsel and i ask no fee for 't
come you know not where my nightcap wrings me
wear it a' th' old fashion let your large ears come through it will be more easy nay i will be bitter bar your wife of her entertainment women are more willingly and more gloriously chaste when they are least restrained of their liberty
it seems you would be a fine capricious mathematically jealous coxcomb take the height of your own horns with a jacob's staff afore they are up
these politic enclosures for paltry mutton makes more rebellion in the flesh than all the provocative electuaries doctors have uttered since last jubilee
this doth not physic me flam
it seems you are jealous i 'll show you the error of it by a familiar example i have seen a pair of spectacles fashioned with such perspective art that lay down but one twelve pence a' th' board 'twill appear as if there were twenty now should you wear a pair of these spectacles and see your wife tying her shoe you would imagine twenty hands were taking up of your wife's clothes and this would put you into a horrible causeless fury
the fault there sir is not in the eyesight
true but they that have the yellow jaundice think all objects they look on to be yellow
jealousy is worse her fits present to a man like so many bubbles in a basin of water twenty several crabbed faces many times makes his own shadow his cuckold maker
see she comes what reason have you to be jealous of this creature
what an ignorant ass or flattering knave might be counted that should write sonnets to her eyes or call her brow the snow of ida or ivory of corinth or compare her hair to the blackbird's bill when 'tis liker the blackbird's feather
be wise i will make you friends and you shall go to bed together
marry look you it shall not be your seeking
do you stand upon that by any means walk you aloof i would not have you seen in 't
sister my lord attend you in the banqueting house your husband is wondrous discontented
i did nothing to displease him i carved to him at supper time
you need not have carved him in faith they say he is a capon already
i must now seemingly fall out with you
shall a gentleman so well descended as camillo a lousy slave that within this twenty years rode with the black guard in the duke's carriage 'mongst spits and dripping pans
now he begins to tickle her
an excellent scholar one that hath a head fill'd with calves' brains without any sage in them come crouching in the hams to you for a night's lodging
that hath an itch in 's hams which like the fire at the glass house hath not gone out this seven years is he not a courtly gentleman
when he wears white satin one would take him by his black muzzle to be no other creature than a maggot you are a goodly foil i confess well set out but cover'd with a false stone yon counterfeit diamond
he will make her know what is in me
come my lord attends you thou shalt go to bed to my lord
now he comes to 't
with a relish as curious as a vintner going to taste new wine
i am opening your case hard
a virtuous brother o' my credit
he will give thee a ring with a philosopher's stone in it
indeed i am studying alchemy
thou shalt lie in a bed stuffed with turtle's feathers swoon in perfumed linen like the fellow was smothered in roses
so perfect shall be thy happiness that as men at sea think land and trees and ships go that way they go so both heaven and earth shall seem to go your voyage
shalt meet him 'tis fix'd with nails of diamonds to inevitable necessity
how shalt rid him hence
i will put brize in 's tail set him gadding presently
i have almost wrought her to it i find her coming but might i advise you now for this night i would not lie with her i would cross her humour to make her more humble
shall i shall flam
it will show in you a supremacy of judgment
true and a mind differing from the tumultuary opinion for quæ negata grata
right you are the adamant shall draw her to you though you keep distance off
walk by her a' th' nobleman's fashion and tell her you will lie with her at the end of the progress
vittoria i cannot be induc'd or as a man would say incited vit
to do what sir
to lie with you to night
your silkworm used to fast every third day and the next following spins the better
to morrow at night i am for you
you 'll spin a fair thread trust to 't
but do you hear i shall have you steal to her chamber about midnight
do you think so
why look you brother because you shall not say i 'll gull you take the key lock me into the chamber and say you shall be sure of me
in troth i will i 'll be your jailor once
a pox on 't as i am a christian
tell me to morrow how scurvily she takes my unkind parting
didst thou not mark the jest of the silkworm
good night in faith i will use this trick often
so now you are safe
ha ha ha thou entanglest thyself in thine own work like a silkworm
come sister darkness hides your blush
women are like cursed dogs civility keeps them tied all daytime but they are let loose at midnight then they do most good or most mischief
my lord my lord
zanche brings out a carpet spreads it and lays on it two fair cushions
enter cornelia listening but unperceived
give credit i could wish time would stand still and never end this interview this hour but all delight doth itself soon'st devour
let me into your bosom happy lady pour out instead of eloquence my vows
loose me not madam for if you forgo me i am lost eternally
sir in the way of pity i wish you heart whole
you are a sweet physician
sure sir a loathed cruelty in ladies is as to doctors many funerals it takes away their credit
we call the cruel fair what name for you that are so merciful
see now they close
my fears are fall'n upon me oh my heart
my son the pander
now i find our house sinking to ruin
earthquakes leave behind where they have tyranniz'd iron or lead or stone but woe to ruin violent lust leaves none
what value is this jewel
'tis the ornament of a weak fortune
in sooth i 'll have it nay i will but change my jewel for your jewel
excellent his jewel for her jewel well put in duke
nay let me see you wear it
nay lower you shall wear my jewel lower
that 's better she must wear his jewel lower
to pass away the time i 'll tell your grace a dream i had last night
a foolish idle dream methought i walked about the mid of night into a churchyard where a goodly yew tree spread her large root in ground under that yew as i sat sadly leaning on a grave chequer'd with cross sticks there came stealing in your duchess and my husband one of them a pickaxe bore th' other a rusty spade and in rough terms they 'gan to challenge me about this yew
this harmless yew they told me my intent was to root up that well grown yew and plant i' the stead of it a wither'd blackthorn and for that they vow'd to bury me alive
my husband straight with pickaxe 'gan to dig and your fell duchess with shovel like a fury voided out the earth and scatter'd bones lord how methought i trembled and yet for all this terror i could not pray
no the devil was in your dream
when to my rescue there arose methought a whirlwind which let fall a massy arm from that strong plant and both were struck dead by that sacred yew in that base shallow grave that was their due
she hath taught him in a dream to make away his duchess and her husband
sweetly shall i interpret this your dream
you are lodg'd within his arms who shall protect you from all the fevers of a jealous husband from the poor envy of our phlegmatic duchess
i 'll seat you above law and above scandal give to your thoughts the invention of delight and the fruition nor shall government divide me from you longer than a care to keep you great you shall to me at once be dukedom health wife children friends and all
woe to light hearts they still forerun our fall
what fury raised thee up
what make you here my lord this dead of night
never dropp'd mildew on a flower here till now
i pray will you go to bed then lest you be blasted
o that this fair garden had with all poison'd herbs of thessaly at first been planted made a nursery for witchcraft rather than a burial plot for both your honours
dearest mother hear me
o thou dost make my brow bend to the earth
see the curse of children
in life they keep us frequently in tears and in the cold grave leave us in pale fears
come come i will not hear you
where is thy duchess now adulterous duke
thou little dream'st this night she 's come to rome
she had been better corn
the lives of princes should like dials move whose regular example is so strong they make the times by them go right or wrong
so have you done
i do protest if any chaste denial if anything but blood could have allay'd his long suit to me corn
i will join with thee to the most woeful end e'er mother kneel'd if thou dishonour thus thy husband's bed be thy life short as are the funeral tears in great men's brach
fie fie the woman's mad
be thy act judas like betray in kissing may'st thou be envied during his short breath and pitied like a wretch after his death
are you out of your wits
my lord i 'll fetch her back again
no i 'll to bed send doctor julio to me presently
thy rash tongue hath rais'd a fearful and prodigious storm be thou the cause of all ensuing harm
now you that stand so much upon your honour is this a fitting time a' night think you to send a duke home without e'er a man
i would fain know where lies the mass of wealth which you have hoarded for my maintenance that i may bear my beard out of the level of my lord's stirrup
because we are poor shall we be vicious
pray what means have you to keep me from the galleys or the gallows
my father prov'd himself a gentleman sold all 's land and like a fortunate fellow died ere the money was spent
you brought me up at padua i confess where i protest for want of means the university judge me i have been fain to heel my tutor's stockings at least seven years conspiring with a beard made me a graduate then to this duke's service i visited the court whence i return'd more courteous more lecherous by far but not a suit the richer
and shall i having a path so open and so free to my preferment still retain your milk in my pale forehead
no this face of mine i 'll arm and fortify with lusty wine 'gainst shame and blushing
o that i ne'er had borne thee
so would i i would the common'st courtesan in rome had been my mother rather than thyself
nature is very pitiful to whores to give them but few children yet those children plurality of fathers they are sure they shall not want
go go complain unto my great lord cardinal it may be he will justify the act
lycurgus wonder'd much men would provide good stallions for their mares and yet would suffer their fair wives to be barren
the duchess come to court
i like not that
we are engag'd to mischief and must on as rivers to find out the ocean flow with crook bendings beneath forced banks or as we see to aspire some mountain's top the way ascends not straight but imitates the subtle foldings of a winter's snake so who knows policy and her true aspect shall find her ways winding and indirect
i enter francisco de medicis cardinal monticelso marcello isabella young giovanni with little jacques the moor fran
have you not seen your husband since you arrived
surely he is wondrous kind if i had such a dove house as camillo's i would set fire on 't were 't but to destroy the polecats that haunt to it my sweet cousin
lord uncle you did promise me a horse and armour
that i did my pretty cousin
marcello see it fitted
my lord the duke is here
sister away you must not yet be seen
i do beseech you entreat him mildly let not your rough tongue set us at louder variance all my wrongs are freely pardon'd and i do not doubt as men to try the precious unicorn's horn make of the powder a preservative circle and in it put a spider so these arms shall charm his poison force it to obeying and keep him chaste from an infected straying
i wish it may
exit isabella as brachiano and flamineo enter
you are welcome will you sit
i pray my lord be you my orator my heart 's too full i 'll second you anon
ere i begin let me entreat your grace forgo all passion which may be raised by my free discourse
as silent as i' th' church you may proceed
it is a wonder to your noble friends that you having as 'twere enter'd the world with a free scepter in your able hand and having to th' use of nature well applied high gifts of learning should in your prime age neglect your awful throne for the soft down of an insatiate bed
o my lord the drunkard after all his lavish cups is dry and then is sober so at length when you awake from this lascivious dream repentance then will follow like the sting plac'd in the adder's tail
wretched are princes when fortune blasteth but a petty flower of their unwieldy crowns or ravisheth but one pearl from their scepter but alas
when they to wilful shipwreck lose good fame all princely titles perish with their name
you have said my lord mont
enough to give you taste how far i am from flattering your greatness
now you that are his second what say you
do not like young hawks fetch a course about your game flies fair and for you
do not fear it i 'll answer you in your own hawking phrase
some eagles that should gaze upon the sun seldom soar high but take their lustful ease since they from dunghill birds their prey can seize
you shift your shirt there when you retire from tennis
her husband is lord of a poor fortune yet she wears cloth of tissue
will you urge that my good lord cardinal as part of her confession at next shrift and know from whence it sails
she is your strumpet brach
uncivil sir there 's hemlock in thy breath and that black slander
were she a whore of mine all thy loud cannons and thy borrow'd switzers thy galleys nor thy sworn confederates durst not supplant her
let 's not talk on thunder
thou hast a wife our sister would i had given both her white hands to death bound and lock'd fast in her last winding sheet when i gave thee but one
thou hadst given a soul to god then
true thy ghostly father with all his absolution shall ne'er do so by thee
i shall not need lust carries her sharp whip at her own girdle
look to 't for our anger is making thunderbolts
in faith they are but crackers
we 'll end this with the cannon
thou 'lt get naught by it but iron in thy wounds and gunpowder in thy nostrils
better that than change perfumes for plasters
'twere good you 'd show your slaves or men condemn'd your new plough'd forehead
and i 'll meet thee even in a thicket of thy ablest men
my lords you shall not word it any further without a milder limit
have you proclaim'd a triumph that you bait a lion thus
i am tame i am tame sir
we send unto the duke for conference 'bout levies 'gainst the pirates my lord duke is not at home we come ourself in person still my lord duke is busied
but we fear when tiber to each prowling passenger discovers flocks of wild ducks then my lord 'bout moulting time i mean we shall be certain to find you sure enough and speak with you
a mere tale of a tub my words are idle
but to express the sonnet by natural reason enter giovanni
when stags grow melancholic you 'll find the season
no more my lord here comes a champion shall end the difference between you both your son the prince giovanni
see my lords what hopes you store in him this is a casket for both your crowns and should be held like dear
now is he apt for knowledge therefore know it is a more direct and even way to train to virtue those of princely blood by examples than by precepts if by examples whom should he rather strive to imitate than his own father
be his pattern then leave him a stock of virtue that may last should fortune rend his sails and split his mast
your hand boy growing to a soldier
give me a pike
what practising your pike so young fair cousin
suppose me one of homer's frogs my lord tossing my bulrush thus
pray sir tell me might not a child of good discretion be leader to an army
yes cousin a young prince of good discretion might
indeed i have heard 'tis fit a general should not endanger his own person oft so that he make a noise when he 's a horseback like a danske drummer oh 'tis excellent
he need not fight
methinks his horse as well might lead an army for him
if i live i 'll charge the french foe in the very front of all my troops the foremost man
and will not bid my soldiers up and follow but bid them follow me
he flies with the shell on 's head
the first year uncle that i go to war all prisoners that i take i will set free without their ransom
how then will you reward your soldiers that took those prisoners for you
thus my lord i 'll marry them to all the wealthy widows that falls that year
why then the next year following you 'll have no men to go with you to war
why then i 'll press the women to the war and then the men will follow
see a good habit makes a child a man whereas a bad one makes a man a beast
come you and i are friends
most wishedly like bones which broke in sunder and well set knit the more strongly
you have receiv'd the rumour how count lodowick is turn'd a pirate
we are now preparing to fetch him in
we now will leave you and expect from you nothing but kind entreaty
you have charm'd me
exeunt francisco monticelso and giovanni
enter isabella you are in health we see
and above health to see my lord well
so i wonder much what amorous whirlwind hurried you to rome
is your soul charg'd with any grievous sin
'tis burden'd with too many and i think the oftener that we cast our reckonings up our sleep will be the sounder
nay my dear lord i will not have you angry
doth not my absence from you now two months merit one kiss
i do not use to kiss if that will dispossess your jealousy i 'll swear it to you
o my loved lord i do not come to chide my jealousy
i am to learn what that italian means
you are as welcome to these longing arms as i to you a virgin
out upon sweetmeats and continued physic the plague is in them
you have oft for these two lips neglected cassia or the natural sweets of the spring violet they are not yet much wither'd
my lord i should be merry these your frowns show in a helmet lovely but on me in such a peaceful interview methinks they are too roughly knit
do you bandy factions 'gainst me
have you learnt the trick of impudent baseness to complain unto your kindred
never my dear lord
must i be hunted out
or was 't your trick to meet some amorous gallant here in rome that must supply our discontinuance
pray sir burst my heart and in my death turn to your ancient pity though not love
because your brother is the corpulent duke that is the great duke 'sdeath i shall not shortly racket away five hundred crowns at tennis but it shall rest 'pon record
i scorn him like a shav'd polack all his reverend wit lies in his wardrobe he 's a discreet fellow when he 's made up in his robes of state
your brother the great duke because h' 'as galleys and now and then ransacks a turkish fly boat now all the hellish furies take his soul
first made this match accursed be the priest that sang the wedding mass and even my issue
oh too too far you have curs'd
your hand i 'll kiss this is the latest ceremony of my love
henceforth i 'll never lie with thee by this this wedding ring i 'll ne'er more lie with thee
and this divorce shall be as truly kept as if the judge had doomed it
fare you well our sleeps are sever'd
forbid it the sweet union of all things blessed
why the saints in heaven will knit their brows at that
let not thy love make thee an unbeliever this my vow shall never on my soul be satisfied with my repentance let thy brother rage beyond a horrid tempest or sea fight my vow is fixed
o my winding sheet
now shall i need thee shortly
dear my lord let me hear once more what i would not hear never
oh my unkind lord
may your sins find mercy as i upon a woeful widow'd bed shall pray for you if not to turn your eyes upon your wretched wife and hopeful son yet that in time you 'll fix them upon heaven
no more go go complain to the great duke
no my dear lord you shall have present witness how i 'll work peace between you
i will make myself the author of your cursed vow i have some cause to do it you have none
conceal it i beseech you for the weal of both your dukedoms that you wrought the means of such a separation let the fault remain with my supposed jealousy and think with what a piteous and rent heart i shall perform this sad ensuing part
enter francisco flamineo monticelso and camillo brach
well take your course
this is not well my lord
she merits not this welcome
she hath given a sharp welcome
come dry your tears is this a modest course to better what is naught to rail and weep
grow to a reconcilement or by heaven i 'll ne'er more deal between you
sir you shall not no though vittoria upon that condition would become honest
was your husband loud since we departed
by my life sir no i swear by that i do not care to lose
are all these ruins of my former beauty laid out for a whore's triumph
look upon other women with what patience they suffer these slight wrongs and with what justice they study to requite them take that course
o that i were a man or that i had power to execute my apprehended wishes
i would whip some with scorpions
to dig that strumpet's eyes out let her lie some twenty months a dying to cut off her nose and lips pull out her rotten teeth preserve her flesh like mummia for trophies of my just anger
hell to my affliction is mere snow water
by your favour sir brother draw near and my lord cardinal sir let me borrow of you but one kiss henceforth i 'll never lie with you by this this wedding ring
how ne'er more lie with him
and this divorce shall be as truly kept as if in thronged court a thousand ears had heard it and a thousand lawyers' hands sealed to the separation
ne'er lie with me
let not my former dotage make thee an unbeliever this my vow shall never on my soul be satisfied with my repentance manet alta mente repostum
now by my birth you are a foolish mad and jealous woman
you see 'tis not my seeking
was this your circle of pure unicorn's horn you said should charm your lord
now horns upon thee for jealousy deserves them
keep your vow and take your chamber
no sir i 'll presently to padua i will not stay a minute
'twere best to let her have her humour some half day's journey will bring down her stomach and then she 'll turn in post
to see her come to my lord for a dispensation of her rash vow will beget excellent laughter
'unkindness do thy office poor heart break those are the killing griefs which dare not speak
camillo's come my lord
where 's the commission
give me the signet
my lord do you mark their whispering
i will compound a medicine out of their two heads stronger than garlic deadlier than stibium the cantharides which are scarce seen to stick upon the flesh when they work to the heart shall not do it with more silence or invisible cunning
they are sending him to naples but i 'll send him to candy
here 's another property too
a poor quack salving knave my lord one that should have been lashed for 's lechery but that he confessed a judgment had an execution laid upon him and so put the whip to a non plus
and was cozened my lord by an arranter knave than myself and made pay all the colorable execution
he will shoot pills into a man's guts shall make them have more ventages than a cornet or a lamprey he will poison a kiss and was once minded for his masterpiece because ireland breeds no poison to have prepared a deadly vapour in a spaniard's fart that should have poisoned all dublin
oh saint anthony's fire
your secretary is merry my lord
o thou cursed antipathy to nature
look his eye 's bloodshot like a needle a surgeon stitcheth a wound with
let me embrace thee toad and love thee o thou abominable loathsome gargarism that will fetch up lungs lights heart and liver by scruples
i must employ thee honest doctor you must to padua and by the way use some of your skill for us
he dies this night by such a politic strain men shall suppose him by 's own engine slain
but for your duchess' death doctor
i 'll make her sure
small mischiefs are by greater made secure
remember this you slave when knaves come to preferment they rise as gallows in the low countries one upon another's shoulders
monticelso camillo and francisco come forward
here is an emblem nephew pray peruse it 'twas thrown in at your window
here is a stag my lord hath shed his horns and for the loss of them the poor beast weeps the word inopem me copia fecit
that is plenty of horns hath made him poor of horns
what should this mean
i 'll tell you 'tis given out you are a cuckold
is it given out so
i had rather such reports as that my lord should keep within doors
have you any children
you are the happier i 'll tell you a tale
upon a time phbus the god of light or him we call the sun would need to be married the gods gave their consent and mercury was sent to voice it to the general world
but what a piteous cry there straight arose amongst smiths and felt makers brewers and cooks reapers and butter women amongst fishmongers and thousand other trades which are annoyed by his excessive heat
they came to jupiter all in a sweat and do forbid the banns
a great fat cook was made their speaker who entreats of jove that phbus might be gelded for if now when there was but one sun so many men were like to perish by his violent heat what should they do if he were married and should beget more and those children make fireworks like their father
so say i only i apply it to your wife her issue should not providence prevent it would make both nature time and man repent it
look you cousin go change the air for shame see if your absence will blast your cornucopia
marcello is chosen with you joint commissioner for the relieving our italian coast from pirates
i am much honour'd in 't
but sir ere i return the stag's horns may be sprouted greater than those are shed
do not fear it i 'll be your ranger
you must watch i' th' nights then 's the most danger
farewell good marcello all the best fortunes of a soldier's wish bring you a shipboard
were i not best now i am turn'd soldier ere that i leave my wife sell all she hath and then take leave of her
i expect good from you your parting is so merry
a' th' captain's humour right i am resolved to be drunk this night
so 'twas well fitted now shall we discern how his wish'd absence will give violent way to duke brachiano's lust
why that was it to what scorn'd purpose else should we make choice of him for a sea captain
and besides count lodowick which was rumour'd for a pirate is now in padua
i have letters from him which are suppliant to work his quick repeal from banishment he means to address himself for pension unto our sister duchess
we shall not want his absence past six days i fain would have the duke brachiano run into notorious scandal for there 's naught in such cursed dotage to repair his name only the deep sense of some deathless shame
it may be objected i am dishonourable to play thus with my kinsman but i answer for my revenge i 'd stake a brother's life that being wrong'd durst not avenge himself
come to observe this strumpet
sure he 'll not leave her
there 's small pity in 't like mistletoe on sere elms spent by weather let him cleave to her and both rot together
enter brachiano with one in the habit of a conjurer brach
now sir i claim your promise 'tis dead midnight the time prefix'd to show me by your art how the intended murder of camillo and our loath'd duchess grow to action
you have won me by your bounty to a deed i do not often practise
some there are which by sophistic tricks aspire that name which i would gladly lose of necromancer as some that use to juggle upon cards seeming to conjure when indeed they cheat others that raise up their confederate spirits 'bout windmills and endanger their own necks for making of a squib and some there are will keep a curtal to show juggling tricks and give out 'tis a spirit besides these such a whole ream of almanac makers figure flingers fellows indeed that only live by stealth since they do merely lie about stol'n goods they 'd make men think the devil were fast and loose with speaking fustian latin
pray sit down put on this nightcap sir 'tis charmed and now i 'll show you by my strong commanding art the circumstance that breaks your duchess' heart
a dumb show enter suspiciously julio and christophero they draw a curtain where brachiano's picture is they put on spectacles of glass which cover their eyes and noses and then burn perfumes before the picture and wash the lips of the picture that done quenching the fire and putting off their spectacles they depart laughing
enter isabella in her night gown as to bedward with lights after her count lodovico giovanni guidantonio and others waiting on her she kneels down as to prayers then draws the curtain of the picture does three reverences to it and kisses it thrice she faints and will not suffer them to come near it dies sorrow expressed in giovanni and in count lodovico
she is conveyed out solemnly
then she 's dead
she 's poisoned by the fumed picture
'twas her custom nightly before she went to bed to go and visit your picture and to feed her eyes and lips on the dead shadow doctor julio observing this infects it with an oil and other poison'd stuff which presently did suffocate her spirits
methought i saw count lodowick there
he was and by my art i find he did most passionately dote upon your duchess
now turn another way and view camillo's far more politic fate
strike louder music from this charmed ground to yield as fits the act a tragic sound
the second dumb show enter flamineo marcello camillo with four more as captains they drink healths and dance a vaulting horse is brought into the room marcello and two more whispered out of the room while flamineo and camillo strip themselves into their shirts as to vault compliment who shall begin as camillo is about to vault flamineo pitcheth him upon his neck and with the help of the rest writhes his neck about seems to see if it be broke and lays him folded double as 'twere under the horse makes show to call for help marcello comes in laments sends for the cardinal and duke who comes forth with armed men wonders at the act commands the body to be carried home apprehends flamineo marcello and the rest and go as 'twere to apprehend vittoria
'twas quaintly done but yet each circumstance i taste not fully
oh 'twas most apparent
you saw them enter charg'd with their deep healths to their boon voyage and to second that flamineo calls to have a vaulting horse maintain their sport the virtuous marcello is innocently plotted forth the room whilst your eye saw the rest and can inform you the engine of all
it seems marcello and flamineo are both committed
yes you saw them guarded and now they are come with purpose to apprehend your mistress fair vittoria
we are now beneath her roof 'twere fit we instantly make out by some back postern
noble friend you bind me ever to you this shall stand as the firm seal annexed to my hand it shall enforce a payment
sir i thank you
both flowers and weeds spring when the sun is warm and great men do great good or else great harm
i enter francisco de medicis and monticelso their chancellor and register fran
you have dealt discreetly to obtain the presence of all the great lieger ambassadors to hear vittoria's trial
'twas not ill for sir you know we have naught but circumstances to charge her with about her husband's death their approbation therefore to the proofs of her black lust shall make her infamous to all our neighbouring kingdoms
i wonder if brachiano will be here
'twere impudence too palpable
enter flamineo and marcello guarded and a lawyer lawyer
what are you in by the week
so i will try now whether they wit be close prisoner methinks none should sit upon thy sister but old whore masters flam
or cuckolds for your cuckold is your most terrible tickler of lechery
whore masters would serve for none are judges at tilting but those that have been old tilters
my lord duke and she have been very private
you are a dull ass 'tis threatened they have been very public
if it can be proved they have but kissed one another flam
my lord cardinal will ferret them
a cardinal i hope will not catch conies
for to sow kisses mark what i say to sow kisses is to reap lechery and i am sure a woman that will endure kissing is half won
true her upper part by that rule if you will win her neither part too you know what follows
the ambassadors are 'lighted flam
i do put on this feigned garb of mirth to gull suspicion
oh my unfortunate sister
i would my dagger point had cleft her heart when she first saw brachiano you 'tis said were made his engine and his stalking horse to undo my sister
i am a kind of path to her and mine own preferment
thou art a soldier followest the great duke feed'st his victories as witches do their serviceable spirits even with thy prodigal blood what hast got
but like the wealth of captains a poor handful which in thy palm thou bear'st as men hold water seeking to grip it fast the frail reward steals through thy fingers
thou hast scarce maintenance to keep thee in fresh chamois
hear me and thus when we have even pour'd ourselves into great fights for their ambition or idle spleen how shall we find reward
but as we seldom find the mistletoe sacred to physic on the builder oak without a mandrake by it so in our quest of gain alas the poorest of their forc'd dislikes at a limb proffers but at heart it strikes
this is lamented doctrine
when age shall turn thee white as a blooming hawthorn marc
i 'll interrupt you for love of virtue bear an honest heart and stride o'er every politic respect which where they most advance they most infect
were i your father as i am your brother i should not be ambitious to leave you a better patrimony
i 'll think on 't
here there is a passage of the lieger ambassadors over the stage severally
enter french ambassador lawyer
oh my sprightly frenchman
do you know him
he 's an admirable tilter
i saw him at last tilting he showed like a pewter candlestick fashioned like a man in armour holding a tilting staff in his hand little bigger than a candle of twelve i' th' pound
oh but he's an excellent horseman
a lame one in his lofty tricks he sleeps a horseback like a poulterer
enter english and spanish lawyer
lo you my spaniard
he carried his face in 's ruff as i have seen a serving man carry glasses in a cypress hatband monstrous steady for fear of breaking he looks like the claw of a blackbird first salted and then broiled in a candle
the arraignment of vittoria enter francisco monticelso the six lieger ambassadors brachiano vittoria zanche flamineo marcello lawyer and a guard
forbear my lord here is no place assign'd you
this business by his holiness is left to our examination
may it thrive with you
lays a rich gown under him
a chair there for his lordship
forbear your kindness an unbidden guest should travel as dutch women go to church bear their stools with them
at your pleasure sir
stand to the table gentlewoman
now signior fall to your plea
domine judex converte oculos in hanc pestem mulierum corruptissiman
a lawyer that pleads against you
pray my lord let him speak his usual tongue i 'll make no answer else
why you understand latin
i do sir but amongst this auditory which come to hear my cause the half or more may be ignorant in 't
by your favour i will not have my accusation clouded in a strange tongue all this assembly shall hear what you can charge me with
signior you need not stand on 't much pray change your language
oh for god's sake gentlewoman your credit shall be more famous by it
well then have at you
i am at the mark sir i 'll give aim to you and tell you how near you shoot
most literated judges please your lordships so to connive your judgments to the view of this debauch'd and diversivolent woman who such a black concatenation of mischief hath effected that to extirp the memory of 't must be the consummation of her and her projections vit
what 's all this
exorbitant sins must have exulceration
surely my lords this lawyer here hath swallow'd some 'pothecaries' bills or proclamations and now the hard and undigestible words come up like stones we use give hawks for physic
why this is welsh to latin
my lords the woman knows not her tropes nor figures nor is perfect in the academic derivation of grammatical elocution
sir your pains shall be well spar'd and your deep eloquence be worthily applauded amongst thouse which understand you
sir put up your papers in your fustian bag francisco speaks this as in scorn
cry mercy sir 'tis buckram and accept my notion of your learn'd verbosity
i most graduatically thank your lordship i shall have use for them elsewhere
i shall be plainer with you and paint out your follies in more natural red and white than that upon your cheek
you raise a blood as noble in this cheek as ever was your mother's
i must spare you till proof cry whore to that
observe this creature here my honour'd lords a woman of most prodigious spirit in her effected
my honourable lord it doth not suit a reverend cardinal to play the lawyer thus
oh your trade instructs your language
you see my lords what goodly fruit she seems yet like those apples travellers report to grow where sodom and gomorrah stood i will but touch her and you straight shall see she 'll fall to soot and ashes
your envenom'd 'pothecary should do 't
i am resolv'd were there a second paradise to lose this devil would betray it
thou art seldom found in scarlet
who knows not how when several night by night her gates were chok'd with coaches and her rooms outbrav'd the stars with several kind of lights when she did counterfeit a prince's court in music banquets and most riotous surfeits this whore forsooth was holy
shall i expound whore to you
sure i shall i 'll give their perfect character
they are first sweetmeats which rot the eater in man's nostrils poison'd perfumes
they are cozening alchemy shipwrecks in calmest weather
cold russian winters that appear so barren as if that nature had forgot the spring
they are the true material fire of hell worse than those tributes i' th' low countries paid exactions upon meat drink garments sleep ay even on man's perdition his sin
they are those brittle evidences of law which forfeit all a wretched man's estate for leaving out one syllable
they are those flattering bells have all one tune at weddings and at funerals
your rich whores are only treasuries by extortion fill'd and emptied by curs'd riot
they are worse worse than dead bodies which are begg'd at gallows and wrought upon by surgeons to teach man wherein he is imperfect
she 's like the guilty counterfeited coin which whosoe'er first stamps it brings in trouble all that receive it
this character 'scapes me
take from all beasts and from all minerals their deadly poison vit
i 'll tell thee i 'll find in thee a 'pothecary's shop to sample them all
she hath liv'd ill
true but the cardinal 's too bitter
you know what whore is
next the devil adultery enters the devil murder
your unhappy husband is dead
oh he 's a happy husband
now he owes nature nothing
and by a vaulting engine
an active plot he jump'd into his grave
what a prodigy was 't that from some two yards' height a slender man should break his neck
and what's more upon the instant lose all use of speech all vital motion like a man had lain wound up three days
now mark each circumstance
and look upon this creature was his wife
she comes not like a widow she comes arm'd with scorn and impudence is this a mourning habit
had i foreknown his death as you suggest i would have bespoke my mourning
oh you are cunning
you shame your wit and judgment to call it so
is my just defence by him that is my judge call'd impudence
let me appeal then from this christian court to the uncivil tartar
see my lords she scandals our proceedings
humbly thus thus low to the most worthy and respected lieger ambassadors my modesty and womanhood i tender but withal so entangled in a curs'd accusation that my defence of force like perseus must personate masculine virtue
find me but guilty sever head from body we 'll part good friends i scorn to hold my life at yours or any man's entreaty sir
she hath a brave spirit
well well such counterfeit jewels make true ones oft suspected
you are deceiv'd for know that all your strict combined heads which strike against this mine of diamonds shall prove but glassen hammers they shall break
these are but feigned shadows of my evils
terrify babes my lord with painted devils i am past such needless palsy
for your names of 'whore' and 'murderess' they proceed from you as if a man should spit against the wind the filth returns in 's face
pray you mistress satisfy me one question who lodg'd beneath your roof that fatal night your husband broke his neck
that question enforceth me break silence i was there
why i came to comfort her and take some course for settling her estate because i heard her husband was in debt to you my lord
and 'twas strangely fear'd that you would cozen her
who made you overseer
why my charity my charity which should flow from every generous and noble spirit to orphans and to widows
cowardly dogs bark loudest sirrah priest i 'll talk with you hereafter
the sword you frame of such an excellent temper i 'll sheath in your own bowels
there are a number of thy coat resemble your common post boys
your mercenary post boys your letters carry truth but 'tis your guise to fill your mouths with gross and impudent lies
my lord your gown
thou liest 'twas my stool bestow 't upon thy master that will challenge the rest o' th' household stuff for brachiano was ne'er so beggarly to take a stool out of another's lodging let him make vallance for his bed on 't or a demy foot cloth for his most reverend moil
monticelso nemo me impune lacessit
the wolf may prey the better
my lord there 's great suspicion of the murder but no sound proof who did it
for my part i do not think she hath a soul so black to act a deed so bloody if she have as in cold countries husbandmen plant vines and with warm blood manure them even so one summer she will bear unsavoury fruit and ere next spring wither both branch and root
the act of blood let pass only descend to matters of incontinence
i discern poison under your gilded pills
now the duke's gone i will produce a letter wherein 'twas plotted he and you should meet at an apothecary's summer house down by the river tiber view 't my lords where after wanton bathing and the heat of a lascivious banquet i pray read it i shame to speak the rest
grant i was tempted temptation to lust proves not the act casta est quam nemo rogavit
you read his hot love to me but you want my frosty answer
frost i' th' dog days
condemn you me for that the duke did love me
so may you blame some fair and crystal river for that some melancholic distracted man hath drown'd himself in 't
sum up my faults i pray and you shall find that beauty and gay clothes a merry heart and a good stomach to feast are all all the poor crimes that you can charge me with
in faith my lord you might go pistol flies the sport would be more noble
but take your course it seems you 've beggar'd me first and now would fain undo me
i have houses jewels and a poor remnant of crusadoes would those would make you charitable
if the devil did ever take good shape behold his picture
you have one virtue left you will not flatter me
who brought this letter
i am not compell'd to tell you
my lord duke sent to you a thousand ducats the twelfth of august
'twas to keep your cousin from prison i paid use for 't
i rather think 'twas interest for his lust
who says so but yourself
if you be my accuser pray cease to be my judge come from the bench give in your evidence 'gainst me and let these be moderators
my lord cardinal were your intelligencing ears as loving as to my thoughts had you an honest tongue i would not care though you proclaim'd them all
go to go to
after your goodly and vainglorious banquet i 'll give you a choke pear
you were born in venice honourably descended from the vittelli 'twas my cousin's fate ill may i name the hour to marry you he bought you of your father
he spent there in six months twelve thousand ducats and to my acquaintance receiv'd in dowry with you not one julio 'twas a hard pennyworth the ware being so light
i yet but draw the curtain now to your picture you came from thence a most notorious strumpet and so you have continued
nay hear me you shall have time to prate
my lord brachiano alas
i make but repetition of what is ordinary and rialto talk and ballated and would be play'd a' th' stage but that vice many times finds such loud friends that preachers are charm'd silent
you gentlemen flamineo and marcello the court hath nothing now to charge you with only you must remain upon your sureties for your appearance
i stand for marcello
and my lord duke for me
for you vittoria your public fault join'd to th' condition of the present time takes from you all the fruits of noble pity such a corrupted trial have you made both of your life and beauty and been styl'd no less an ominous fate than blazing stars to princes
hear your sentence you are confin'd unto a house of convertites and your bawd flam
oh i am a sound man again
a house of convertites
a house of penitent whores
do the noblemen in rome erect it for their wives that i am sent to lodge there
you must have patience
i must first have vengeance
i fain would know if you have your salvation by patent that you proceed thus
away with her take her hence
yes you have ravish'd justice forc'd her to do your pleasure
fie she 's mad vit
die with those pills in your most cursed maw should bring you health
or while you sit o' th' bench let your own spittle choke you
she 's turned fury
that the last day of judgment may so find you and leave you the same devil you were before
instruct me some good horse leech to speak treason for since you cannot take my life for deeds take it for words
o woman's poor revenge which dwells but in the tongue
i will not weep no i do scorn to call up one poor tear to fawn on your injustice bear me hence unto this house of what's your mitigating title
it shall not be a house of convertites my mind shall make it honester to me than the pope's palace and more peaceable than thy soul though thou art a cardinal
know this and let it somewhat raise your spite through darkness diamonds spread their richest light
now you and i are friends sir we'll shake hands in a friend's grave together a fit place being th' emblem of soft peace t' atone our hatred
sir what 's the matter
i will not chase more blood from that lov'd cheek you have lost too much already fare you well
how strange these words sound
what 's the interpretation
good this is a preface to the discovery of the duchess' death he carries it well
because now i cannot counterfeit a whining passion for the death of my lady i will feign a mad humour for the disgrace of my sister and that will keep off idle questions
treason's tongue hath a villainous palsy in 't i will talk to any man hear no man and for a time appear a politic madman
enter giovanni and count lodovico fran
how now my noble cousin
yes uncle i was taught to imitate you in virtue and you must imitate me in colours of your garments
my sweet mother is fran
is there no yonder indeed sir i 'll not tell you for i shall make you weep
do not blame me now i did not tell you so
she 's dead my lord
bless'd lady thou art now above thy woes
will 't please your lordships to withdraw a little
what do the dead do uncle
do they eat hear music go a hunting and be merry as we that live
no coz they sleep
lord lord that i were dead
i have not slept these six nights
when do they wake
when god shall please
good god let her sleep ever
for i have known her wake an hundred nights when all the pillow where she laid her head was brine wet with her tears
i am to complain to you sir i 'll tell you how they have us'd her now she 's dead they wrapp'd her in a cruel fold of lead and would not let me kiss her
thou didst love her
i have often heard her say she gave me suck and it should seem by that she dearly lov'd me since princes seldom do it
oh all of my poor sister that remains
take him away for god's sake
how now my lord
believe me i am nothing but her grave and i shall keep her blessed memory longer than thousand epitaphs
enter flamineo as distracted marcello and lodovico flam
we endure the strokes like anvils or hard steel till pain itself make us no pain to feel
who shall do me right now
is this the end of service
i'd rather go weed garlic travail through france and be mine own ostler wear sheep skin linings or shoes that stink of blacking be entered into the list of the forty thousand pedlars in poland
would i had rotted in some surgeon's house at venice built upon the pox as well as on piles ere i had served brachiano
you must have comfort
your comfortable words are like honey they relish well in your mouth that 's whole but in mine that 's wounded they go down as if the sting of the bee were in them
oh they have wrought their purpose cunningly as if they would not seem to do it of malice
in this a politician imitates the devil as the devil imitates a canon wheresoever he comes to do mischief he comes with his backside towards you
enter french ambassador fr
the proofs are evident
o gold what a god art thou
and o man what a devil art thou to be tempted by that cursed mineral
your diversivolent lawyer mark him
knaves turn informers as maggots turn to flies you may catch gudgeons with either
i would he would hear me there 's nothing so holy but money will corrupt and putrify it like victual under the line
you are happy in england my lord here they sell justice with those weights they press men to death with
bells ne'er ring well till they are at their full pitch and i hope yon cardinal shall never have the grace to pray well till he come to the scaffold
if they were racked now to know the confederacy but your noblemen are privileged from the rack and well may for a little thing would pull some of them a pieces afore they came to their arraignment
religion oh how it is commeddled with policy
the first blood shed in the world happened about religion
would i were a jew
oh there are too many
you are deceived there are not jews enough priests enough nor gentlemen enough
i 'll prove it for if there were jews enough so many christians would not turn usurers if priests enough one should not have six benefices and if gentlemen enough so many early mushrooms whose best growth sprang from a live by begging be thou one of them practise the art of wolner in england to swallow all 's given thee and yet let one purgation make thee as hungry again as fellows that work in a saw pit
i 'll go hear the screech owl
this was brachiano's pander and 'tis strange that in such open and apparent guilt of his adulterous sister he dare utter so scandalous a passion
i must wind him
how dares this banish'd count return to rome his pardon not yet purchas'd
i have heard the deceased duchess gave him pension and that he came along from padua th' train of the young prince
there 's somewhat in 't physicians that cure poisons still do work with counter poisons
mark this strange encounter
the god of melancholy turn thy gall to poison and let the stigmatic wrinkles in thy face like to the boisterous waves in a rough tide one still overtake another
i do thank thee and i do wish ingeniously for thy sake the dog days all year long
how croaks the raven
is our good duchess dead
misfortune comes like the coroner's business huddle upon huddle
shalt thou and i join housekeeping
yes content let 's be unsociably sociable
sit some three days together and discourse
only with making faces lie in our clothes
with faggots for our pillows
in taffeta linings that 's genteel melancholy sleep all day
yes and like your melancholic hare feed after midnight
enter antonelli and gasparo
we are observed see how yon couple grieve
what a strange creature is a laughing fool
as if man were created to no use but only to show his teeth
i 'll tell thee what it would do well instead of looking glasses to set one's face each morning by a saucer of a witch's congeal'd blood
never till the beggary of courtiers the discontent of churchmen want of soldiers and all the creatures that hang manacled worse than strappadoed on the lowest felly of fortune's wheel be taught in our two lives to scorn that world which life of means deprives
my lord i bring good news
the pope on 's death bed at th' earnest suit of the great duke of florence hath sign'd your pardon and restor'd unto you lodo
i thank you for your news
look up again flamineo see my pardon
why do you laugh
there was no such condition in our covenant
you shall not seem a happier man than i you know our vow sir if you will be merry do it i' th' like posture as if some great man sat while his enemy were executed though it be very lechery unto thee do 't with a crabbed politician's face
your sister is a damnable whore
look you i spake that laughing
dost ever think to speak again
wilt sell me forty ounces of her blood to water a mandrake
poor lord you did vow to live a lousy creature
like one that had for ever forfeited the daylight by being in debt
i do not greatly wonder you do break your lordship learn'd 't long since
but i 'll tell you
and 't shall stick by you
i long for it
this laughter scurvily becomes your face if you will not be melancholy be angry
see now i laugh too
you are to blame i 'll force you hence
exeunt marcello and flamineo
that e'er i should be forc'd to right myself upon a pander
had been as good met with his fist a thunderbolt
how did my sword miss him
these rogues that are most weary of their lives still 'scape the greatest dangers
a pox upon him all his reputation nay all the goodness of his family is not worth half this earthquake i learn'd it of no fencer to shake thus come i 'll forget him and go drink some wine
i enter francisco and monticelso mont
come come my lord untie your folded thoughts and let them dangle loose as a bride's hair
far be it from my thoughts to seek revenge
what are you turn'd all marble
shall i defy him and impose a war most burthensome on my poor subjects' necks which at my will i have not power to end
you know for all the murders rapes and thefts committed in the horrid lust of war he that unjustly caus'd it first proceed shall find it in his grave and in his seed
that 's not the course i 'd wish you pray observe me
we see that undermining more prevails than doth the cannon
bear your wrongs conceal'd and patient as the tortoise let this camel stalk o'er your back unbruis'd sleep with the lion and let this brood of secure foolish mice play with your nostrils till the time be ripe for th' bloody audit and the fatal gripe aim like a cunning fowler close one eye that you the better may your game espy
free me my innocence from treacherous acts
i know there 's thunder yonder and i 'll stand like a safe valley which low bends the knee to some aspiring mountain since i know treason like spiders weaving nets for flies by her foul work is found and in it dies
to pass away these thoughts my honour'd lord it is reported you possess a book wherein you have quoted by intelligence the names of all notorious offenders lurking about the city
sir i do and some there are which call it my black book
well may the title hold for though it teach not the art of conjuring yet in it lurk the names of many devils
pray let 's see it
i 'll fetch it to your lordship
monticelso i will not trust thee but in all my plots i 'll rest as jealous as a town besieg'd
thou canst not reach what i intend to act your flax soon kindles soon is out again but gold slow heats and long will hot remain
enter monticelso with the book mont
'tis here my lord
first your intelligencers pray let 's see
their number rises strangely and some of them you 'd take for honest men
these are your pirates and these following leaves for base rogues that undo young gentlemen by taking up commodities for politic bankrupts for fellows that are bawds to their own wives only to put off horses and slight jewels clocks defac'd plate and such commodities at birth of their first children
these are for impudent bawds that go in men's apparel for usurers that share with scriveners for their good reportage for lawyers that will antedate their writs and some divines you might find folded there but that i slip them o'er for conscience' sake
here is a general catalogue of knaves a man might study all the prisons o'er yet never attain this knowledge
fold down the leaf i pray good my lord let me borrow this strange doctrine
pray use 't my lord
i do assure your lordship you are a worthy member of the state and have done infinite good in your discovery of these offenders
better than tribute of wolves paid in england 'twill hang their skins o' th' hedge
i must make bold to leave your lordship
dearly sir i thank you if any ask for me at court report you have left me in the company of knaves
i gather now by this some cunning fellow that 's my lord's officer and that lately skipp'd from a clerk's desk up to a justice' chair hath made this knavish summons and intends as th' irish rebels wont were to sell heads so to make prize of these
and thus it happens your poor rogues pay for 't which have not the means to present bribe in fist the rest o' th' band are razed out of the knaves' record or else my lord he winks at them with easy will his man grows rich the knaves are the knaves still
but to the use i 'll make of it it shall serve to point me out a list of murderers agents for my villany
did i want ten leash of courtesans it would furnish me nay laundress three armies
that in so little paper should lie th' undoing of so many men
'tis not so big as twenty declarations
see the corrupted use some make of books divinity wrested by some factious blood draws swords swells battles and o'erthrows all good
to fashion my revenge more seriously let me remember my dear sister's face call for her picture
no i 'll close mine eyes and in a melancholic thought i 'll frame enter isabella's ghost
her figure 'fore me
now i ha' 't how strong imagination works
how she can frame things which are not
methinks she stands afore me and by the quick idea of my mind were my skill pregnant i could draw her picture
thought as a subtle juggler makes us deem things supernatural which have cause common as sickness
how cam'st thou by thy death
how idle am i to question mine own idleness
did ever man dream awake till now
remove this object out of my brain with 't what have i to do with tombs or death beds funerals or tears that have to meditate upon revenge
so now 'tis ended like an old wife's story
statesmen think often they see stranger sights than madmen
come to this weighty business
my tragedy must have some idle mirth in 't else it will never pass
i am in love in love with corombona and my suit thus halts to her in verse
i have done it rarely oh the fate of princes
i am so us'd to frequent flattery that being alone i now flatter myself but it will serve 'tis seal'd
bear this to the house of convertites and watch your leisure to give it to the hands of corombona or to the matron when some followers of brachiano may be by
he that deals all by strength his wit is shallow when a man's head goes through each limb will follow
the engine for my business bold count lodowick 'tis gold must such an instrument procure with empty fist no man doth falcons lure
brachiano i am now fit for thy encounter like the wild irish i 'll ne'er think thee dead till i can play at football with thy head flectere si nequeo superos acheronta movebo
enter the matron and flamineo matron
should it be known the duke hath such recourse to your imprison'd sister i were like incur much damage by it
the pope lies on his death bed and their heads are troubled now with other business than guarding of a lady
yonder 's flamineo in conference with the matrona
let me speak with you i would entreat you to deliver for me this letter to the fair vittoria
with all care and secrecy hereafter you shall know me and receive thanks for this courtesy
i 'll see 't deliver'd
what 's that you read flamineo
'to the most unfortunate his best respected vittoria'
who was the messenger
you speak as if a man should know what fowl is coffin'd in a bak'd meat afore you cut it up
i 'll open 't were 't her heart
what 's here subscrib'd
this juggling is gross and palpable
i have found out the conveyance
read it read it
"your tears i 'll turn to triumphs be but mine your prop is fallen i pity that a vine which princes heretofore have long'd to gather wanting supporters now should fade and wither
" wine i' faith my lord with lees would serve his turn
"your sad imprisonment i 'll soon uncharm and with a princely uncontrolled arm lead you to florence where my love and care shall hang your wishes in my silver hair
" a halter on his strange equivocation
"nor for my years return me the sad willow who prefer blossoms before fruit that 's mellow
" rotten on my knowledge with lying too long i' th' bedstraw
"and all the lines of age this line convinces the gods never wax old no more do princes
" a pox on 't tear it let 's have no more atheists for god's sake
i 'll cut her into atomies and let th' irregular north wind sweep her up and blow her int' his nostrils where 's this whore
what do you call her
oh i could be mad
prevent the curs'd disease she 'll bring me to and tear my hair off
where 's this changeable stuff
o'er head and ears in water i assure you she is not for your wearing
what me my lord

a bloodhound do you brave do you stand me
let those that have diseases run i need no plasters
would you be kick'd

i tell you duke i am not in russia my shins must be kept whole
do you know me
oh my lord methodically
as in this world there are degrees of evils so in this world there are degrees of devils
you 're a great duke i your poor secretary
i do look now for a spanish fig or an italian sallet daily
pander ply your convoy and leave your prating
all your kindness to me is like that miserable courtesy of polyphemus to ulysses you reserve me to be devoured last you would dig turfs out of my grave to feed your larks that would be music to you
come i 'll lead you to her
do you face me
oh sir i would not go before a politic enemy with my back towards him though there were behind me a whirlpool
enter vittoria to brachiano and flamineo brach
can you read mistress
look upon that letter there are no characters nor hieroglyphics
you need no comment i am grown your receiver
you shall be a brave great lady a stately and advanced whore
come come let 's see your cabinet discover your treasury of love letters
i 'll see them all
sir upon my soul i have not any
whence was this directed
confusion on your politic ignorance
you are reclaim'd are you
i 'll give you the bells and let you fly to the devil
ware hawk my lord
this is some treacherous plot my lord to me he ne'er was lovely i protest so much as in my sleep
oh ten thousand curses on 't
how long have i beheld the devil in crystal
thou hast led me like an heathen sacrifice with music and with fatal yokes of flowers to my eternal ruin
woman to man is either a god or a wolf
we 'll be as differing as two adamants the one shall shun the other
procure but ten of thy dissembling trade ye 'd furnish all the irish funerals with howling past wild irish
that hand that cursed hand which i have wearied with doting kisses
oh my sweetest duchess how lovely art thou now
my loose thoughts scatter like quicksilver i was bewitch'd for all the world speaks ill of thee
no matter i 'll live so now i 'll make that world recant and change her speeches
you did name your duchess
whose death god pardon
whose death god revenge on thee most godless duke
now for two whirlwinds
what have i gain'd by thee but infamy
thou hast stain'd the spotless honour of my house and frighted thence noble society like those which sick o' th' palsy and retain ill scenting foxes 'bout them are still shunn'd by those of choicer nostrils
what do you call this house
is this your palace
did not the judge style it a house of penitent whores
who sent me to it
to this incontinent college
is 't not you
is 't not your high preferment
go go brag how many ladies you have undone like me
fare you well sir let me hear no more of you
i had a limb corrupted to an ulcer but i have cut it off and now i 'll go weeping to heaven on crutches
for your gifts i will return them all and i do wish that i could make you full executor to all my sins
o that i could toss myself into a grave as quickly
for all thou art worth i 'll not shed one tear more i 'll burst first
she throws herself upon a bed
i have drunk lethe vittoria
what do you ail my love
why do you weep
yes i now weep poniards do you see
are not those matchless eyes mine
i had rather they were not matches
is not this lip mine
yes thus to bite it off rather than give it thee
turn to my lord good sister
am i the author of your sin
yes he 's a base thief that a thief lets in
we 're blown up my lord brach
wilt thou hear me
once to be jealous of thee is t' express that i will love thee everlastingly and never more be jealous
o thou fool whose greatness hath by much o'ergrown thy wit
what dar'st thou do that i not dare to suffer excepting to be still thy whore
for that in the sea's bottom sooner thou shalt make a bonfire
oh no oaths for god's sake
will you hear me
what a damn'd imposthume is a woman's will
can nothing break it
fie fie my lord women are caught as you take tortoises she must be turn'd on her back
sister by this hand i am on your side
come come you have wrong'd her what a strange credulous man were you my lord to think the duke of florence would love her
will any mercer take another's ware when once 'tis tows'd and sullied
and yet sister how scurvily this forwardness becomes you
young leverets stand not long and women's anger should like their flight procure a little sport a full cry for a quarter of an hour and then be put to th' dead quat
shall these eyes which have so long time dwelt upon your face be now put out
no cruel landlady i' th' world which lends forth groats to broom men and takes use for them would do 't
hand her my lord and kiss her be not like a ferret to let go your hold with blowing
let us renew right hands
never shall rage or the forgetful wine make me commit like fault
now you are i' th' way on 't follow 't hard
be thou at peace with me let all the world threaten the cannon
mark his penitence best natures do commit the grossest faults when they 're given o'er to jealousy as best wine dying makes strongest vinegar
i 'll tell you the sea 's more rough and raging than calm rivers but not so sweet nor wholesome
a quiet woman is a still water under a great bridge a man may shoot her safely
o ye dissembling men
we suck'd that sister from women's breasts in our first infancy
to add misery to misery
am i not low enough
ay ay your good heart gathers like a snowball now your affection 's cold
ud's foot it shall melt to a heart again or all the wine in rome shall run o' th' lees for 't
your dog or hawk should be rewarded better than i have been
i 'll speak not one word more
stop her mouth with a sweet kiss my lord
so now the tide 's turn'd the vessel 's come about
he 's a sweet armful
oh we curl hair'd men are still most kind to women
that you should chide thus
oh sir your little chimneys do ever cast most smoke
i sweat for you
couple together with as deep a silence as did the grecians in their wooden horse
my lord supply your promises with deeds you know that painted meat no hunger feeds
stay ungrateful rome flam
it deserve to be call'd barbary for our villainous usage
soft the same project which the duke of florence whether in love or gallery i know not laid down for her escape will i pursue
and no time fitter than this night my lord
the pope being dead and all the cardinals enter'd the conclave for th' electing a new pope the city in a great confusion we may attire her in a page's suit lay her post horse take shipping and amain for padua
i 'll instantly steal forth the prince giovanni and make for padua
you two with your old mother and young marcello that attends on florence if you can work him to it follow me i will advance you all for you vittoria think of a duchess' title
stay my lord i 'll tell you a tale
the crocodile which lives in the river nilus hath a worm breeds i' th' teeth of 't which puts it to extreme anguish a little bird no bigger than a wren is barber surgeon to this crocodile flies into the jaws of 't picks out the worm and brings present remedy
the fish glad of ease but ungrateful to her that did it that the bird may not talk largely of her abroad for non payment closeth her chaps intending to swallow her and so put her to perpetual silence
but nature loathing such ingratitude hath armed this bird with a quill or prick on the head top o' th' which wounds the crocodile i' th' mouth forceth her open her bloody prison and away flies the pretty tooth picker from her cruel patient
your application is i have not rewarded the service you have done me
you sister are the crocodile you are blemish'd in your fame my lord cures it and though the comparison hold not in every particle yet observe remember what good the bird with the prick i' th' head hath done you and scorn ingratitude
it may appear to some ridiculous thus to talk knave and madman and sometimes come in with a dried sentence stuffed with sage but this allows my varying of shapes knaves do grow great by being great men's apes
enter francisco lodovico gasparo and six ambassadors fran
so my lord i commend your diligence
guard well the conclave and as the order is let none have conference with the cardinals
i shall my lord
room for the ambassadors
they 're wondrous brave to day why do they wear these several habits
oh sir they 're knights of several orders that lord i' th' black cloak with the silver cross is knight of rhodes the next knight of st
michael that of the golden fleece the frenchman there knight of the holy ghost my lord of savoy knight of th' annunciation the englishman is knight of th' honour'd garter dedicated unto their saint st
i could describe to you their several institutions with the laws annexed to their orders but that time permits not such discovery
where 's count lodowick
'tis o' th' point of dinner time marshal the cardinals' service
enter servants with several dishes covered
stand let me search your dish
who 's this for
for my lord cardinal monticelso
for my lord cardinal of bourbon
why doth he search the dishes
to observe what meat is dressed
no sir but to prevent lest any letters should be convey'd in to bribe or to solicit the advancement of any cardinal
when first they enter 'tis lawful for the ambassadors of princes to enter with them and to make their suit for any man their prince affecteth best but after till a general election no man may speak with them
you that attend on the lord cardinals open the window and receive their viands
you must return the service the lord cardinals are busied 'bout electing of the pope they have given o'er scrutiny and are fallen to admiration
i 'll lay a thousand ducats you hear news of a pope presently
hark sure he 's elected behold my lord of arragon appears on the church battlements
a cardinal on the terrace
denuntio vobis gaudium magnum reverendissimus cardinalis lorenzo de monticelso electus est in sedem apostolicam et elegit sibi nomen paulum quartum
vivat sanctus pater paulus quartus
vittoria my lord fran
well what of her
is fled the city fran
where 's the prince giovanni
gone with his father
let the matrona of the convertites be apprehended
how fortunate are my wishes
why 'twas this i only labour'd i did send the letter instruct him what to do
thy fame fond duke i first have poison'd directed thee the way to marry a whore what can be worse
this follows the hand must act to drown the passionate tongue i scorn to wear a sword and prate of wrong
enter monticelso in state mont
concedimus vobis apostolicam benedictionem et remissionem peccatorum
my lord reports vittoria corombona is stol'n from forth the house of convertites by brachiano and they 're fled the city
now though this be the first day of our seat we cannot better please the divine power than to sequester from the holy church these cursed persons
make it therefore known we do denounce excommunication against them both all that are theirs in rome we likewise banish
exeunt all but francisco and lodovico
come dear lodovico you have ta'en the sacrament to prosecute th' intended murder
but sir i wonder you 'll engage yourself in person being a great prince
most of his court are of my faction and some are of my council
noble friend our danger shall be like in this design give leave part of the glory may be mine
why did the duke of florence with such care labour your pardon
italian beggars will resolve you that who begging of alms bid those they beg of do good for their own sakes or 't may be he spreads his bounty with a sowing hand like kings who many times give out of measure not for desert so much as for their pleasure
i know you 're cunning
come what devil was that that you were raising
i ask you how doth the duke employ you that his bonnet fell with such compliment unto his knee when he departed from you
why my lord he told me of a resty barbary horse which he would fain have brought to the career the sault and the ring galliard now my lord i have a rare french rider
take your heed lest the jade break your neck
do you put me off with your wild horse tricks
sirrah you do lie
oh thou 'rt a foul black cloud and thou dost threat a violent storm
storms are i' th' air my lord i am too low to storm
i know that thou art fashion'd for all ill like dogs that once get blood they 'll ever kill
about some murder was 't not
i 'll not tell you and yet i care not greatly if i do marry with this preparation
holy father i come not to you as an intelligencer but as a penitent sinner what i utter is in confession merely which you know must never be reveal'd
you have o'erta'en me
sir i did love brachiano's duchess dearly or rather i pursued her with hot lust though she ne'er knew on 't
she was poison'd upon my soul she was for which i have sworn avenge her murder
to the duke of florence
to him i have
if thou persist in this 'tis damnable
dost thou imagine thou canst slide on blood and not be tainted with a shameful fall
or like the black and melancholic yew tree dost think to root thyself in dead men's graves and yet to prosper
instruction to thee comes like sweet showers to o'er harden'd ground they wet but pierce not deep
and so i leave thee with all the furies hanging 'bout thy neck till by thy penitence thou remove this evil in conjuring from thy breast that cruel devil
i 'll give it o'er he says 'tis damnable besides i did expect his suffrage by reason of camillo's death
enter servant and francisco fran
do you know that count
bear him these thousand ducats to his lodging
tell him the pope hath sent them
happily that will confirm more than all the rest
his holiness hath sent you a thousand crowns and wills you if you travel to make him your patron for intelligence
his creature ever to be commanded
why now 'tis come about
he rail'd upon me and yet these crowns were told out and laid ready before he knew my voyage
oh the art the modest form of greatness
that do sit like brides at wedding dinners with their looks turn'd from the least wanton jests their puling stomach sick from the modesty when their thoughts are loose even acting of those hot and lustful sports are to ensue about midnight such his cunning
he sounds my depth thus with a golden plummet
i am doubly arm'd now
now to th' act of blood there 's but three furies found in spacious hell but in a great man's breast three thousand dwell
v i a passage over the stage of brachiano flamineo marcello hortensio corombona cornelia zanche and others flamineo and hortensio remain
in all the weary minutes of my life day ne'er broke up till now
this marriage confirms me happy
'tis a good assurance
saw you not yet the moor that 's come to court
yes and conferr'd with him i' th' duke's closet
i have not seen a goodlier personage nor ever talk'd with man better experience'd in state affairs or rudiments of war
he hath by report serv'd the venetian in candy these twice seven years and been chief in many a bold design
what are those two that bear him company
two noblemen of hungary that living in the emperor's service as commanders eight years since contrary to the expectation of the court entered into religion in the strict order of capuchins but being not well settled in their undertaking they left their order and returned to court for which being after troubled in conscience they vowed their service against the enemies of christ went to malta were there knighted and in their return back at this great solemnity they are resolved for ever to forsake the world and settle themselves here in a house of capuchins in padua
one thing makes it so they have vowed for ever to wear next their bare bodies those coats of mail they served in
is the moor a christian
why proffers he his service to our duke
because he understands there 's like to grow some wars between us and the duke of florence in which he hopes employment
i never saw one in a stern bold look wear more command nor in a lofty phrase express more knowing or more deep contempt of our slight airy courtiers as if he travell'd all the princes' courts of christendom in all things strives t' express that all that should dispute with him may know glories like glow worms afar off shine bright but look'd to near have neither heat nor light
enter brachiano francisco disguised like mulinassar lodovico and gasparo bearing their swords their helmets down antonelli farnese
you are nobly welcome
we have heard at full your honourable service 'gainst the turk
to you brave mulinassar we assign a competent pension and are inly sorry the vows of those two worthy gentlemen make them incapable of our proffer'd bounty
your wish is you may leave your warlike swords for monuments in our chapel i accept it as a great honour done me and must crave your leave to furnish out our duchess' revels
only one thing as the last vanity you e'er shall view deny me not to stay to see a barriers prepar'd to night you shall have private standings
it hath pleas'd the great ambassadors of several princes in their return from rome to their own countries to grace our marriage and to honour me with such a kind of sport
i shall persuade them to stay my lord
set on there to the presence
exeunt brachiano flamineo and hortensio
noble my lord most fortunately welcome the conspirators here embrace
you have our vows seal'd with the sacrament to second your attempts
and all things ready he could not have invented his own ruin had he despair'd with more propriety
you would not take my way
have poison'd his prayer book or a pair of beads the pummel of his saddle his looking glass or th' handle of his racket o that that
that while he had been bandying at tennis he might have sworn himself to hell and strook his soul into the hazard
oh my lord i would have our plot be ingenious and have it hereafter recorded for example rather than borrow example
there 's no way more speeding that this thought on
and yet methinks that this revenge is poor because it steals upon him like a thief to have ta'en him by the casque in a pitch'd field led him to florence lodo
it had been rare and there have crown'd him with a wreath of stinking garlic have shown the sharpness of his government and rankness of his lust
exeunt lodovico antonelli and gasparo
enter flamineo marcello and zanche marc
why doth this devil haunt you say
i know not for by this light i do not conjure for her
'tis not so great a cunning as men think to raise the devil for here 's one up already the greatest cunning were to lay him down
she is your shame
i pray thee pardon her
in faith you see women are like to burs where their affection throws them there they 'll stick
that is my countryman a goodly person when he 's at leisure i 'll discourse with him in our own language
i beseech you do
how is 't brave soldier
oh that i had seen some of your iron days
i pray relate some of your service to us
'tis a ridiculous thing for a man to be his own chronicle i did never wash my mouth with mine own praise for fear of getting a stinking breath
you 're too stoical
the duke will expect other discourse from you
i shall never flatter him i have studied man too much to do that
what difference is between the duke and no more than between two bricks all made of one clay only 't may be one is placed in top of a turret the other in the bottom of a well by mere chance
if i were placed as high as the duke i should stick as fast make as fair a show and bear out weather equally
if this soldier had a patent to beg in churches then he would tell them stories
i have been a soldier too
how have you thrived
that 's the misery of peace only outsides are then respected
as ships seem very great upon the river which show very little upon the seas so some men i' th' court seem colossuses in a chamber who if they came into the field would appear pitiful pigmies
give me a fair room yet hung with arras and some great cardinal to lug me by th' ears as his endeared minion
and thou mayest do the devil knows what villainy
right you shall see in the country in harvest time pigeons though they destroy never so much corn the farmer dare not present the fowling piece to them why
because they belong to the lord of the manor whilst your poor sparrows that belong to the lord of heaven they go to the pot for 't
i will now give you some politic instruction
the duke says he will give you pension that 's but bare promise get it under his hand
for i have known men that have come from serving against the turk for three or four months they have had pension to buy them new wooden legs and fresh plasters but after 'twas not to be had
and this miserable courtesy shows as if a tormentor should give hot cordial drinks to one three quarters dead o' th' rack only to fetch the miserable soul again to endure more dog days
enter hortensio a young lord zanche and two more
what are they ready for the barriers
yes the lords are putting on their armour
a new upstart one that swears like a falconer and will lie in the duke's ear day by day like a maker of almanacs and yet i knew him since he came to th' court smell worse of sweat than an under tennis court keeper
look you yonder 's your sweet mistress
thou art my sworn brother i 'll tell thee i do love that moor that witch very constrainedly
she knows some of my villainy
i do love her just as a man holds a wolf by the ears but for fear of her turning upon me and pulling out my throat i would let her go to the devil
i hear she claims marriage of thee
'faith i made to her some such dark promise and in seeking to fly from 't i run on like a frighted dog with a bottle at 's tail that fain would bite it off and yet dares not look behind him
now my precious gipsy
ay your love to me rather cools than heats
marry i am the sounder lover we have many wenches about the town heat too fast
what do you think of these perfumed gallants then
their satin cannot save them i am confident they have a certain spice of the disease for they that sleep with dogs shall rise with fleas
believe it a little painting and gay clothes make you loathe me
how love a lady for painting or gay apparel
i 'll unkennel one example more for thee
æsop had a foolish dog that let go the flesh to catch the shadow i would have courtiers be better diners
you remember your oaths
lovers' oaths are like mariners' prayers uttered in extremity but when the tempest is o'er and that the vessel leaves tumbling they fall from protesting to drinking
and yet amongst gentlemen protesting and drinking go together and agree as well as shoemakers and westphalia bacon they are both drawers on for drink draws on protestation and protestation draws on more drink
is not this discourse better now than the morality of your sunburnt gentleman
is this your perch you haggard
fly to th' stews
you should be clapped by th' heels now strike i' th' court
she 's good for nothing but to make her maids catch cold a nights they dare not use a bedstaff for fear of her light fingers
you 're a strumpet an impudent one
why do you kick her say
do you think that she 's like a walnut tree
must she be cudgell'd ere she bear good fruit
she brags that you shall marry her
i had rather she were pitch'd upon a stake in some new seeded garden to affright her fellow crows thence
you 're a boy a fool be guardian to your hound i am of age
if i take her near you i 'll cut her throat
with a fan of feather
and for you i 'll whip this folly from you
i 'll purge it with rhubarb
hang him he wrongs me most that ought t' offend me least i do suspect my mother play'd foul play when she conceiv'd thee
now by all my hopes like the two slaughter'd sons of dipus the very flames of our affection shall turn two ways
those words i 'll make thee answer with thy heart blood
do like the geese in the progress you know where you shall find me
and thou be'st a noble friend bear him my sword and bid him fit the length on 't
exeunt all but zanche
hence petty thought of my disgrace
i ne'er lov'd my complexion till now 'cause i may boldly say without a blush i love you
your love is untimely sown there 's a spring at michaelmas but 'tis but a faint one i am sunk in years and i have vowed never to marry
poor maids get more lovers than husbands yet you may mistake my wealth
for as when ambassadors are sent to congratulate princes there 's commonly sent along with them a rich present so that though the prince like not the ambassador's person nor words yet he likes well of the presentment so i may come to you in the same manner and be better loved for my dowry than my virtue
i 'll think on the motion
do i 'll now detain you no longer
at your better leisure i 'll tell you things shall startle your blood nor blame me that this passion i reveal lovers die inward that their flames conceal
of all intelligence this may prove the best sure i shall draw strange fowl from this foul nest
enter marcello and cornelia corn
i hear a whispering all about the court you are to fight who is your opposite
what is the quarrel
'tis an idle rumour
sure you do not well to fright me thus you never look thus pale but when you are most angry
i do charge you upon my blessing nay i 'll call the duke and he shall school you
publish not a fear which would convert to laughter 'tis not so
was not this crucifix my father's
i have heard you say giving my brother suck he took the crucifix between his hands enter flamineo
and broke a limb off
yes but 'tis mended
i have brought your weapon back
flamineo runs marcello through
you have brought it home indeed
oh he 's murder'd
do you turn your gall up
i 'll to sanctuary and send a surgeon to you
enter lodovico hortensio and gasparo hort
oh mother now remember what i told of breaking of the crucifix
there are some sins which heaven doth duly punish in a whole family
this it is to rise by all dishonest means
let all men know that tree shall long time keep a steady foot whose branches spread no wider than the root
oh my perpetual sorrow
pray leave him lady come you shall
he is not dead he 's in a trance
why here 's nobody shall get anything by his death
let me call him again for god's sake
i would you were deceived
oh you abuse me you abuse me you abuse me
how many have gone away thus for lack of 'tendance
rear up 's head rear up 's head
his bleeding inward will kill him
you see he is departed
let me come to him give me him as he is if he be turn'd to earth let me but give him one hearty kiss and you shall put us both in one coffin
fetch a looking glass see if his breath will not stain it or pull out some feathers from my pillow and lay them to his lips
will you lose him for a little painstaking
your kindest office is to pray for him
i would not pray for him yet
he may live to lay me i' th' ground and pray for me if you 'll let me come to him
enter brachiano all armed save the beaver with flamineo and others brach
was this your handiwork
it was my misfortune
he lies he lies
he did not kill him these have killed him that would not let him be better looked to
have comfort my griev'd mother
oh you screech owl
let me go let me go
she runs to flamineo with her knife drawn and coming to him lets it fall
the god of heaven forgive thee
dost not wonder i pray for thee
i 'll tell thee what 's the reason i have scarce breath to number twenty minutes i 'd not spend that in cursing
fare thee well half of thyself lies there and mayst thou live to fill an hour glass with his moulder'd ashes to tell how thou shouldst spend the time to come in blessed repentance
mother pray tell me how came he by his death
what was the quarrel
indeed my younger boy presum'd too much upon his manhood gave him bitter words drew his sword first and so i know not how for i was out of my wits he fell with 's head just in my bosom
that is not true madam
i pray thee peace
one arrow 's graze'd already it were vain lose this for that will ne'er be found again
go bear the body to cornelia's lodging and we command that none acquaint our duchess with this sad accident
for you flamineo hark you i will not grant your pardon
only a lease of your life and that shall last but for one day thou shalt be forc'd each evening to renew it or be hang'd
lodovico sprinkles brachiano's beaver with a poison
enter francisco your will is law now i 'll not meddle with it
you once did brave me in your sister's lodging i 'll now keep you in awe for 't
where 's our beaver
he calls for his destruction
noble youth i pity thy sad fate
now to the barriers
this shall his passage to the black lake further the last good deed he did he pardon'd murder
they fight at barriers first single pairs then three to three enter brachiano and flamineo with others brach
ud's death an armourer
where 's the armourer
tear off my beaver
are you hurt my lord
oh my brain 's on fire
the helmet is poison'd
my lord upon my soul brach
away with him to torture
there are some great ones that have hand in this and near about me
enter vittoria corombona vit
oh my lov'd lord
here 's unfortunate revels
a plague upon you
we have too much of your cunning here already i fear the ambassadors are likewise poison'd
oh i am gone already
the infection flies to the brain and heart
o thou strong heart
there 's such a covenant 'tween the world and it they 're loath to break
oh my most loved father
remove the boy away
where 's this good woman
had i infinite worlds they were too little for thee must i leave thee
what say you screech owls is the venom mortal
most corrupted politic hangman you kill without book but your art to save fails you as oft as great men's needy friends
i that have given life to offending slaves and wretched murderers have i not power to lengthen mine own a twelvemonth
do not kiss me for i shall poison thee
this unctions 's sent from the great duke of florence
sir be of comfort
o thou soft natural death that art joint twin to sweetest slumber
no rough bearded comet stares on thy mild departure the dull owl bears not against thy casement the hoarse wolf scents not thy carrion pity winds thy corse whilst horror waits on princes'
i am lost for ever
how miserable a thing it is to die 'mongst women howling
enter lodovico and gasparo as capuchins
franciscans they have brought the extreme unction
on pain of death let no man name death to me it is a word infinitely terrible
withdraw into our cabinet
exeunt all but francisco and flamineo
to see what solitariness is about dying princes
as heretofore they have unpeopled towns divorced friends and made great houses unhospitable so now o justice
where are their flatterers now
flatterers are but the shadows of princes' bodies the least thick cloud makes them invisible
there 's great moan made for him
'faith for some few hours salt water will run most plentifully in every office o' th' court but believe it most of them do weep over their stepmothers' graves
why they dissemble as some men do that live without compass o' th' verge
come you have thrived well under him
'faith like a wolf in a woman's breast i have been fed with poultry but for money understand me i had as good a will to cozen him as e'er an officer of them all but i had not cunning enough to do it
what didst thou think of him
he was a kind of statesman that would sooner have reckoned how many cannon bullets he had discharged against a town to count his expense that way than think how many of his valiant and deserving subjects he lost before it
oh speak well of the duke
wilt hear some of my court wisdom
to reprehend princes is dangerous and to over commend some of them is palpable lying
how is it with the duke
he 's fallen into a strange distraction he talks of battles and monopolies levying of taxes and from that descends to the most brain sick language
his mind fastens on twenty several objects which confound deep sense with folly
such a fearful end may teach some men that bear too lofty crest though they live happiest yet they die not best
he hath conferr'd the whole state of the dukedom upon your sister till the prince arrive at mature age
there 's some good luck in that yet
see here he comes
enter brachiano presented in a bed vittoria and others
there 's death in 's face already
oh my good lord
away you have abus'd me these speeches are several kinds of distractions and in the action should appear so
you have convey'd coin forth our territories bought and sold offices oppress'd the poor and i ne'er dreamt on 't
make up your accounts i 'll now be mine own steward
indeed i am to blame for did you ever hear the dusky raven chide blackness
or was 't ever known the devil rail'd against cloven creatures
let me have some quails to supper
no some fried dog fish your quails feed on poison
that old dog fox that politician florence
i 'll forswear hunting and turn dog killer
i 'll be friends with him for mark you sir one dog still sets another a barking
yonder 's a fine slave come in now
why there in a blue bonnet and a pair of breeches with a great cod piece ha ha ha
look you his cod piece is stuck full of pins with pearls o' th' head of them
do you not know him
why 'tis the devil
i know him by a great rose he wears on 's shoe to hide his cloven foot
i 'll dispute with him he 's a rare linguist
my lord here 's nothing
when i want money our treasury is empty there is nothing i 'll not be use'd thus
oh lie still my lord
see see flamineo that kill'd his brother is dancing on the ropes there and he carries a money bag in each hand to keep him even for fear of breaking 's neck and there 's a lawyer in a gown whipped with velvet stares and gapes when the money will fall
how the rogue cuts capers
it should have been in a halter
'tis there what 's she
her hair is sprinkl'd with orris powder that makes her look as if she had sinn'd in the pastry
a divine my lord
brachiano seems here near his end lodovico and gasparo in the habit of capuchins present him in his bed with a crucifix and hallowed candle
he will be drunk avoid him th' argument is fearful when churchmen stagger in 't
look you six grey rats that have lost their tails crawl upon the pillow send for a rat catcher i 'll do a miracle i 'll free the court from all foul vermin
i do not like that he names me so often especially on 's death bed 'tis a sign i shall not live long
see he 's near his end
pray give us leave
see how firmly he doth fix his eye upon the crucifix
oh hold it constant
it settles his wild spirits and so his eyes melt into tears
domine brachiane solebas in bello tutus esse tuo clypeo nunc hunc clypeum hosti tuo opponas infernali
olim hastâ valuisti in bello nunc hanc sacram hastam vibrabis contra hostem animarum
by the hallowed taper
attende domine brachiane si nunc quoque probes ea quæ acta sunt inter nos flecte caput in dextrum
esto securus domine brachiane cogita quantum habeas meritorum denique memineris mean animam pro tuâ oppignoratum si quid esset periculi
si nunc quoque probas ea quæ acta sunt inter nos flecte caput in lvum
he is departing pray stand all apart and let us only whisper in his ears some private meditations which our order permits you not to hear
here the rest being departed lodovico and gasparo discover themselves
devil brachiano thou art damn'd
a slave condemn'd and given up to the gallows is thy great lord and master
true for thou art given up to the devil
you that were held the famous politician whose art was poison
and whose conscience murder
that would have broke your wife's neck down the stairs ere she was poison'd
that had your villainous sallets
and fine embroider'd bottles and perfumes equally mortal with a winter plague
now there 's mercury lodo
with other devilish 'pothecary stuff a melting in your politic brains dost hear
this is count lodovico
this gasparo and thou shalt die like a poor rogue
and stink like a dead fly blown dog
and be forgotten before the funeral sermon
oh the cursed devil comes to himself a gain
strangle him in private
enter vittoria and the attendants
will you call him again to live in treble torments
for charity for christian charity avoid the chamber
you would prate sir
this is a true love knot sent from the duke of florence
what is it done
the snuff is out
no woman keeper i' th' world though she had practis'd seven year at the pest house could have done 't quaintlier
my lords he 's dead
vittoria and the others come forward omnes
rest to his soul
this place is hell
how heavily she takes it
oh yes yes had women navigable rivers in their eyes they would dispend them all
surely i wonder why we should wish more rivers to the city when they sell water so good cheap
i 'll tell thee these are but moorish shades of griefs or fears there 's nothing sooner dry than women's tears
why here 's an end of all my harvest he has given me nothing
let wise men count them curs'd for while you live he that scores best pays worst
sure this was florence' doing
very likely those are found weighty strokes which come from th' hand but those are killing strokes which come from th' head
oh the rare tricks of a machiavellian
he doth not come like a gross plodding slave and buffet you to death no my quaint knave he tickles you to death makes you die laughing as if you had swallow'd down a pound of saffron
you see the feat 'tis practis'd in a trice to teach court honesty it jumps on ice
now have the people liberty to talk and descant on his vices
misery of princes that must of force be censur'd by their slaves
not only blam'd for doing things are ill but for not doing all that all men will one were better be a thresher
i would fain speak with this duke yet
now he 's dead
i cannot conjure but if prayers or oaths will get to th' speech of him though forty devils wait on him in his livery of flames i 'll speak to him and shake him by the hand though i be blasted
did you terrify him at the last gasp
yes and so idly that the duke had like have terrified us
enter the moor lodo
you shall hear that hereafter
see yon 's the infernal that would make up sport
now to the revelation of that secret she promis'd when she fell in love with you
you 're passionately met in this sad world
i would have you look up sir these court tears claim not your tribute to them let those weep that guiltily partake in the sad cause
i knew last night by a sad dream i had some mischief would ensue yet to say truth my dream most concern'd you
shall 's fall a dreaming
yes and for fashion sake i 'll dream with her
methought sir you came stealing to my bed
wilt thou believe me sweeting
by this light i was a dreamt on thee too for methought i saw thee naked
as i told you methought you lay down by me
so dreamt i and lest thou shouldst take cold i cover'd thee with this irish mantle
verily i did dream you were somewhat bold with me but to come to 't lodo
i hope you will not got to 't here
nay you must hear my dream out
when i threw the mantle o'er thee thou didst laugh exceedingly methought
and criedst out the hair did tickle thee
there was a dream indeed
mark her i pray thee she simpers like the suds a collier hath been wash'd in
come sir good fortune tends you
i did tell you i would reveal a secret isabella the duke of florence' sister was empoisone'd by a fum'd picture and camillo's neck was broke by damn'd flamineo the mischance laid on a vaulting horse
the bed of snakes is broke
i sadly do confess i had a hand in the black deed
thou kept'st their counsel
right for which urg'd with contrition i intend this night to rob vittoria
usurers dream on 't while they sleep out sermons
to further our escape i have entreated leave to retire me till the funeral unto a friend i' th' country that excuse will further our escape
in coin and jewels i shall at least make good unto your use an hundred thousand crowns
those crowns we 'll share
it is a dowry methinks should make that sun burnt proverb false and wash the æthiop white
be ready for our flight
an hour 'fore day
why till now we knew not the circumstances of either of their deaths
re enter zanche zan
you 'll wait about midnight in the chapel
why now our action 's justified
what harms it justice
we now like the partridge purge the disease with laurel for the fame shall crown the enterprise and quit the shame
enter flamineo and gasparo at one door another way giovanni attended gas
the young duke did you e'er see a sweeter prince
i have known a poor woman's bastard better favoured this is behind him
now to his face all comparisons were hateful
wise was the courtly peacock that being a great minion and being compared for beauty by some dottrels that stood by to the kingly eagle said the eagle was a far fairer bird than herself not in respect of her feathers but in respect of her long talons his will grow out in time
i pray leave me sir
your grace must be merry 'tis i have cause to mourn for wot you what said the little boy that rode behind his father on horseback
why what said he
when you are dead father said he i hope that i shall ride in the saddle
oh 'tis a brave thing for a man to sit by himself
he may stretch himself in the stirrups look about and see the whole compass of the hemisphere
you 're now my lord i' th' saddle
study your prayers sir and be penitent 'twere fit you 'd think on what hath former been i have heard grief nam'd the eldest child of sin
he threatens me divinely
i am falling to pieces already
i care not though like anacharsis i were pounded to death in a mortar and yet that death were fitter for usurers gold and themselves to be beaten together to make a most cordial cullis for the devil
he hath his uncle's villainous look already in decimo sexto
now sir what are you
it is the pleasure sir of the young duke that you forbear the presence and all rooms that owe him reverence
so the wolf and the raven are very pretty fools when they are young
it is your office sir to keep me out
so the duke wills
verily master courtier extremity is not to be used in all offices say that a gentlewoman were taken out of her bed about midnight and committed to castle angelo to the tower yonder with nothing about her but her smock would it not show a cruel part in the gentleman porter to lay claim to her upper garment pull it o'er her head and ears and put her in naked
very good you are merry
doth he make a court ejectment of me
a flaming fire brand casts more smoke without a chimney than within 't
i 'll smoor some of them
enter francisco de medicis
i met even now with the most piteous sight
thou meet'st another here a pitiful degraded courtier
your reverend mother is grown a very old woman in two hours
i found them winding of marcello's corse and there is such a solemn melody 'tween doleful songs tears and sad elegies such as old granddames watching by the dead were wont t' outwear the nights with that believe me i had no eyes to guide me forth the room they were so o'ercharg'd with water
i will see them
'twere much uncharity in you for your sight will add unto their tears
i will see them they are behind the traverse i 'll discover their superstitions howling
he draws the traverse
cornelia the moor and three other ladies discovered winding marcello's corse
this rosemary is wither'd pray get fresh
i would have these herbs grow upon his grave when i am dead and rotten
reach the bays i 'll tie a garland here about his head i have kept this twenty year and every day hallow'd it with my prayers i did not think he should have wore it
look you who are yonder
oh reach me the flowers
her ladyship 's foolish
alas her grief hath turn'd her child again
you 're very welcome to flamineo
there 's rosemary for you and rue for you heart's ease for you i pray make much of it i have left more for myself
lady who 's this
you are i take it the grave maker
will you make me such a fool
here 's a white hand can blood so soon be washed out
let me see when screech owls croak upon the chimney tops and the strange cricket i' th' oven sings and hops when yellow spots do on your hands appear be certain then you of a corse shall hear
out upon 't how 'tis speckled
h' 'as handled a toad sure
cowslip water is good for the memory pray buy me three ounces of 't
i would i were from hence
do you hear sir
i 'll give you a saying which my grandmother was wont when she heard the bell toll to sing o'er unto her lute
do an you will do
call for the robin redbreast and the wren cornelia doth this in several forms of distraction
since o'er shady groves they hover and with leaves and flowers do cover the friendless bodies of unburied men
call unto his funeral dole the ant the fieldmouse and the mole to rear him hillocks that shall keep him warm and when gay tombs are robb'd sustain no harm but keep the wolf far thence that 's foe to men for with his nails he 'll dig them up again
they would not bury him 'cause he died in a quarrel but i have an answer for them let holy church receive him duly since he paid the church tithes truly
his wealth is summ'd and this is all his store this poor men get and great men get no more
now the wares are gone we may shut up shop
bless you all good people
exeunt cornelia and ladies
i have a strange thing in me to th' which i cannot give a name without it be compassion
i pray leave me
this night i 'll know the utmost of my fate i 'll be resolv'd what my rich sister means assign me for my service
i have liv'd riotously ill like some that live in court and sometimes when my face was full of smiles have felt the maze of conscience in my breast
oft gay and honour'd robes those tortures try we think cag'd birds sing when indeed they cry
enter brachiano's ghost in his leather cassock and breeches boots a cowl a pot of lily flowers with a skull in 't ha
i can stand thee nearer nearer yet
what a mockery hath death made thee
in what place art thou
in yon starry gallery
or in the cursed dungeon
pray sir resolve me what religion 's best for a man to die in
or is it in your knowledge to answer me how long i have to live
that 's the most necessary question
are you still like some great men that only walk like shadows up and down and to no purpose say the ghost throws earth upon him and shows him the skull
he throws earth upon me
a dead man's skull beneath the roots of flowers
i pray speak sir our italian churchmen make us believe dead men hold conference with their familiars and many times will come to bed with them and eat with them
he 's gone and see the skull and earth are vanish'd
this is beyond melancholy
i do dare my fate to do its worst
now to my sister's lodging and sum up all those horrors the disgrace the prince threw on me next the piteous sight of my dead brother and my mother's dotage and last this terrible vision all these shall with vittoria's bounty turn to good or i will drown this weapon in her blood
v enter francisco lodovico and hortensio lodo
my lord upon my soul you shall no further you have most ridiculously engag'd yourself too far already
for my part i have paid all my debts so if i should chance to fall my creditors fall not with me and i vow to quit all in this bold assembly to the meanest follower
my lord leave the city or i 'll forswear the murder
farewell lodovico if thou dost perish in this glorious act i 'll rear unto thy memory that fame shall in the ashes keep alive thy name
there 's some black deed on foot
i 'll presently down to the citadel and raise some force
these strong court factions that do brook no checks in the career oft break the riders' necks
enter vittoria with a book in her hand zanche flamineo following them flam
what are you at your prayers
i come to you 'bout worldly business
sit down sit down
nay stay blowze you may hear it the doors are fast enough
yes yes with wormwood water you shall taste some of it presently
what intends the fury
you are my lord's executrix and i claim reward for my long service
come therefore here is pen and ink set down what you will give me
have you done already
'tis a most short conveyance
i will read it i give that portion to thee and no other which cain groan'd under having slain his brother
a most courtly patent to beg by
you are a villain
is 't come to this
they say affrights cure agues thou hast a devil in thee i will try if i can scare him from thee
nay sit still my lord hath left me yet two cases of jewels shall make me scorn your bounty you shall see them
sure he 's distracted
oh he 's desperate
for your own safety give him gentle language
he enters with two cases of pistols
look these are better far at a dead lift than all your jewel house
and yet methinks these stones have no fair lustre they are ill set
i 'll turn the right side towards you you shall see how they will sparkle
turn this horror from me
what do you want
what would you have me do
is not all mine yours
have i any children
pray thee good woman do not trouble me with this vain worldly business say your prayers neither yourself nor i should outlive him the numbering of four hours
did he enjoin it
he did and 'twas a deadly jealousy lest any should enjoy thee after him that urged him vow me to it
for my death i did propound it voluntarily knowing if he could not be safe in his own court being a great duke what hope then for us
this is your melancholy and despair
away fool thou art to think that politicians use to kill the effects or injuries and let the cause live
shall we groan in irons or be a shameful and a weighty burthen to a public scaffold
this is my resolve i would not live at any man's entreaty nor die at any's bidding
will you hear me
my life hath done service to other men my death shall serve mine own turn make you ready
do you mean to die indeed
with as much pleasure as e'er my father gat me
are the doors lock'd
are you grown an atheist
will you turn your body which is the goodly palace of the soul to the soul's slaughter house
oh the cursed devil which doth present us with all other sins thrice candied o'er despair with gall and stibium yet we carouse it off
cry out for help
makes us forsake that which was made for man the world to sink to that was made for devils eternal darkness
i 'll stop your throat with winter plums
i pray thee yet remember millions are now in graves which at last day like mandrakes shall rise shrieking
leave your prating for these are but grammatical laments feminine arguments and they move me as some in pulpits move their auditory more with their exclamation than sense of reason or sound doctrine
gentle madam seem to consent only persuade him to teach the way to death let him die first
'tis good i apprehend it
to kill one's self is meat that we must take like pills not chew'd but quickly swallow it the smart o' th' wound or weakness of the hand may else bring treble torments
i have held it a wretched and most miserable life which is not able to die
yet i am now resolv'd farewell affliction
behold brachiano i that while you liv'd did make a flaming altar of my heart to sacrifice unto you now am ready to sacrifice heart and all
do you think that i 'll outlive you especially when my best self flamineo goes the same voyage
o most loved moor
only by all my love let me entreat you since it is most necessary one of us do violence on ourselves let you or i be her sad taster teach her how to die
thou dost instruct me nobly take these pistols because my hand is stain'd with blood already two of these you shall level at my breast the other 'gainst your own and so we 'll die most equally contented but first swear not to outlive me
then here 's an end of me farewell daylight
and o contemptible physic
that dost take so long a study only to preserve so short a life i take my leave of thee
these are two cupping glasses that shall draw all my infected blood out
whither shall i go now
o lucian thy ridiculous purgatory
to find alexander the great cobbling shoes pompey tagging points and julius cæsar making hair buttons hannibal selling blacking and augustus crying garlic charlemagne selling lists by the dozen and king pepin crying apples in a cart drawn with one horse
whether i resolve to fire earth water air or all the elements by scruples i know not nor greatly care
of all deaths the violent death is best for from ourselves it steals ourselves so fast the pain once apprehended is quite past
they shoot and run to him and tread upon him
what are you dropped
i am mix'd with earth already as you are noble perform your vows and bravely follow me
to most assur'd damnation
oh thou most cursed devil
thou art caught vit
in thine own engine
i tread the fire out that would have been my ruin
will you be perjured
what a religious oath was styx that the gods never durst swear by and violate
oh that we had such an oath to minister and to be so well kept in our courts of justice
think whither thou art going
and remember what villainies thou hast acted
this thy death shall make me like a blazing ominous star look up and tremble
oh i am caught with a spring
you see the fox comes many times short home 'tis here prov'd true
kill'd with a couple of braches
no fitter offing for the infernal furies than one in whom they reign'd while he was living
oh the way 's dark and horrid
i cannot see shall i have no company
oh yes thy sins do run before thee to fetch fire from hell to light thee thither
oh i smell soot most stinking soot
the chimney 's afire my liver 's parboil'd like scotch holly bread there 's a plumber laying pipes in my guts it scalds
wilt thou outlive me
yes and drive a stake through thy body for we 'll give it out thou didst this violence upon thyself
now i have tried your love and doubled all your reaches i am not wounded
the pistols held no bullets 'twas a plot to prove your kindness to me and i live to punish your ingratitude
i knew one time or other you would find a way to give me a strong potion
o men that lie upon your death beds and are haunted with howling wives
ne'er trust them they 'll re marry ere the worm pierce your winding sheet ere the spider make a thin curtain for your epitaphs
how cunning you were to discharge
do you practise at the artillery yard
never never brachiano be my precedent
we lay our souls to pawn to the devil for a little pleasure and a woman makes the bill of sale
that ever man should marry
for one hypermnestra that saved her lord and husband forty nine of her sisters cut their husbands' throats all in one night
there was a shoal of virtuous horse leeches
here are two other instruments
enter lodovico gasparo still disguised as capuchins vit
what noise is that
false keys i' th 'court
we have brought you a mask
a matachin it seems by your drawn swords
do you know us now
yes and that moor the duke gave pension to was the great duke of florence
oh we are lost
you shall not take justice forth from my hands oh let me kill her
i 'll cut my safety through your coats of steel
fate 's a spaniel we cannot beat it from us
let all that do ill take this precedent man may his fate foresee but not prevent and of all axioms this shall win the prize 'tis better to be fortunate than wise
bind him to the pillar
oh your gentle pity
i have seen a blackbird that would sooner fly to a man's bosom than to stay the gripe of the fierce sparrow hawk
your hope deceives you
if florence be i' th' court would he would kill me
princes give rewards with their own hands but death or punishment by the hands of other
sirrah you once did strike me i 'll strike you unto the centre
thou 'lt do it like a hangman a base hangman not like a noble fellow for thou see'st i cannot strike again
wouldst have me die as i was born in whining
recommend yourself to heaven
no i will carry mine own commendations thither
oh i could kill you forty times a day and use 't four years together 'twere too little
naught grieves but that you are too few to feed the famine of our vengeance
what dost think on
nothing of nothing leave thy idle questions
i am i' th' way to study a long silence to prate were idle
there 's nothing of so infinite vexation as man's own thoughts
o thou glorious strumpet
could i divide thy breath from this pure air when 't leaves thy body i would suck it up and breathe 't upon some dunghill
you my death's man
methinks thou dost not look horrid enough thou hast too good a face to be a hangman if thou be do thy office in right form fall down upon thy knees and ask forgiveness
oh thou hast been a most prodigious comet
but i 'll cut off your train
kill the moor first
you shall not kill her first behold my breast i will be waited on in death my servant shall never go before me
are you so brave
yes i shall welcome death as princes do some great ambassadors i 'll meet thy weapon half way
thou dost tremble methinks fear should dissolve thee into air
oh thou art deceiv'd i am too true a woman
conceit can never kill me
i 'll tell thee what i will not in my death shed one base tear or if look pale for want of blood not fear
thou art my task black fury
i have blood as red as either of theirs wilt drink some
'tis good for the falling sickness
i am proud death cannot alter my complexion for i shall ne'er look pale
strike strike with a joint motion
'twas a manly blow the next thou giv'st murder some sucking infant and then thou wilt be famous
oh what blade is 't
a toledo or an english fox
i ever thought a culter should distinguish the cause of my death rather than a doctor
search my wound deeper tent it with the steel that made it
oh my greatest sin lay in my blood
now my blood pays for 't
th' art a noble sister
i love thee now if woman do breed man she ought to teach him manhood
know many glorious women that are fam'd for masculine virtue have been vicious only a happier silence did betide them she hath no faults who hath the art to hide them
my soul like to a ship in a black storm is driven i know not whither
prosperity doth bewitch men seeming clear but seas do laugh show white when rocks are near
we cease to grieve cease to be fortune's slaves nay cease to die by dying
and thou so near the bottom
false report which says that women vie with the nine muses for nine tough durable lives
i do not look who went before nor who shall follow me no at my self i will begin the end
while we look up to heaven we confound knowledge with knowledge
oh i am in a mist
oh happy they that never saw the court nor ever knew great men but by report
i recover like a spent taper for a flash and instantly go out
let all that belong to great men remember th' old wives' tradition to be like the lions i' th' tower on candlemas day to mourn if the sun shine for fear of the pitiful remainder of winter to come
'tis well yet there 's some goodness in my death my life was a black charnel
i have caught an everlasting cold i have lost my voice most irrecoverably
this busy trade of life appears most vain since rest breeds rest where all seek pain by pain
let no harsh flattering bells resound my knell strike thunder and strike loud to my farewell
enter ambassadors and giovanni eng
this way this way
break open the doors
why then let 's constantly all die together and having finish'd this most noble deed defy the worst of fate nor fear to bleed
keep back the prince shoot
oh i am wounded
i fear i shall be ta'en
you bloody villains by what authority have you committed this massacre
yes thy uncle which is a part of thee enjoined us to 't thou know'st me i am sure i am count lodowick and thy most noble uncle in disguise was last night in thy court
yes that moor thy father chose his pensioner
away with them to prison and to torture all that have hands in this shall taste our justice as i hope heaven
i do glory yet that i can call this act mine own
for my part the rack the gallows and the torturing wheel shall be but sound sleeps to me here 's my rest i limn'd this night piece and it was my best
see my honour'd lord what use you ought make of their punishment
let guilty men remember their black deeds do lean on crutches made of slender reeds
