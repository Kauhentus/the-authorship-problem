and a street in london
enter the and the my lord mayor you have sundry times feasted myself and many courtiers more seldom or never can we be so kind to make requital of your courtesy
but leaving this i hear my cousin lacy is much affected to your daughter rose
true my good lord and she loves him so well that i mislike her boldness in the chase
why my lord mayor think you it then a shame to join a lacy with an oateley's name
too mean is my poor girl for his high birth poor citizens must not with courtiers wed who will in silks and gay apparel spend more in one year than i am worth by far therefore your honour need not doubt my girl
take heed my lord advise you what you do
a verier unthrift lives not in the world than is my cousin for i'll tell you what 'tis now almost a year since he requested to travel countries for experience i furnished him with coin bills of exchange letters of credit men to wait on him solicited my friends in italy well to respect him
but to see the end scant had he journeyed through half germany but all his coin was spent his men cast off his bills embezzled and my jolly coz ashamed to show his bankrupt presence here became a shoemaker in wittenberg a goodly science for a gentleman of such descent
now judge the rest by this suppose your daughter have a thousand pound he did consume me more in one half year and make him heir to all the wealth you have one twelvemonth's rioting will waste it all
then seek my lord some honest citizen to wed your daughter to
i thank your lordship
aside well fox i understand your subtilty
as for your nephew let your lordship's eye but watch his actions and you need not fear for i have sent my daughter far enough
and yet your cousin rowland might do well now he hath learned an occupation and yet i scorn to call him son in law
ay but i have a better trade for him i thank his grace he hath appointed him chief colonel of all those companies mustered in london and the shires about to serve his highness in those wars of france
see where he comes
enter and lovell what news with you
my lord of lincoln 'tis his highness' will that presently your cousin ship for france with all his powers he would not for a million but they should land at dieppe within four days
go certify his grace it shall be done
exit now cousin lacy in what forwardness are all your companies
the men of hertfordshire lie at mile end suffolk and essex train in tothill fields the londoners and those of middlesex all gallantly prepared in finsbury with frolic spirits long for their parting hour
they have their imprest coats and furniture and if it please your cousin lacy come to the guildhall he shall receive his pay and twenty pounds besides my brethren will freely give him to approve our loves we bear unto my lord your uncle here
i thank your honour
thanks my good lord mayor
at the guildhall we will expect your coming
to approve your loves to me
nephew that twenty pound he doth bestow for joy to rid you from his daughter rose
but cousins both now here are none but friends i would not have you cast an amorous eye upon so mean a project as the love of a gay wanton painted citizen
i know this churl even in the height of scorn doth hate the mixture of his blood with thine
i pray thee do thou so
remember coz what honourable fortunes wait on thee increase the king's love which so brightly shines and gilds thy hopes
i have no heir but thee and yet not thee if with a wayward spirit thou start from the true bias of my love
my lord i will for honour not desire of land or livings or to be your heir so guide my actions in pursuit of france as shall add glory to the lacys' name
coz for those words here's thirty portuguese and nephew askew there's a few for you
fair honour in her loftiest eminence stays in france for you till you fetch her thence
then nephews clap swift wings on your designs begone begone make haste to the guildhall there presently i'll meet you
do not stay where honour beckons shame attends delay
how gladly would your uncle have you gone
true coz but i'll o'erreach his policies
i have some serious business for three days which nothing but my presence can dispatch
you therefore cousin with the companies shall haste to dover there i'll meet with you or if i stay past my prefix√®d time away for france we'll meet in normandy
the twenty pounds my lord mayor gives to me you shall receive and these ten portuguese part of mine uncle's thirty
gentle coz have care to our great charge i know your wisdom hath tried itself in higher consequence
coz all myself am yours yet have this care to lodge in london with all secrecy our uncle lincoln hath besides his own many a jealous eye that in your face stares only to watch means for your disgrace

a garden at old ford
enter alone making a garland
here sit thou down upon this flow'ry bank and make a garland for thy lacy's head
these pinks these roses and these violets these blushing gilliflowers these marigolds the fair embroidery of his coronet carry not half such beauty in their cheeks as the sweet countenance of my lacy doth
o my most unkind father
o my stars why lowered you so at my nativity to make me love yet live robbed of my love
here as a thief am i imprison√´d for my dear lacy's sake within those walls which by my father's cost were builded up for better purposes here must i languish for him that doth as much lament i know mine absence as for him i pine in woe
good morrow young mistress
i am sure you make that garland for me against i shall be lady of the harvest
sybil what news at london
none but good my lord mayor your father and master philpot your uncle and master scot your cousin and mistress frigbottom by doctors' commons do all by my troth send you most hearty commendations
did lacy send kind greetings to his love
o yes out of cry by my troth
i scant knew him here 'a wore a scarf and here a scarf here a bunch of feathers and here precious stones and jewels and a pair of garters o monstrous
like one of our yellow silk curtains at home here in old ford house here in master belly mount's chamber
i stood at our door in cornhill looked at him he at me indeed spake to him but he not to me not a word marry go up thought i with a wanion
he passed by me as proud marry foh
are you grown humorous thought i and so shut the door and in i came
o sybil how dost thou my lacy wrong
my rowland is as gentle as a lamb no dove was ever half so mild as he
yea as a bushel of stamped crabs
he looked upon me as sour as verjuice
go thy ways thought i thou may'st be much in my gaskins but nothing in my nether stocks
this is your fault mistress to love him that loves not you he thinks scorn to do as he's done to but if i were as you i'd cry go by jeronimo go by
i'd set mine old debts against my new driblets and the hare's foot against the goose giblets for if ever i sigh when sleep i should take pray god i may lose my maidenhead when i wake
will my love leave me then and go to france
i know not that but i am sure i see him stalk before the soldiers

do so good sybil
meantime wretched i will sit and sigh for his lost company
a street in london
enter disguised as a dutch shoemaker
how many shapes have gods and kings devised thereby to compass their desired loves
it is no shame for rowland lacy then to clothe his cunning with the gentle craft that thus disguised i may unknown possess the only happy presence of my rose
for her have i forsook my charge in france incurred the king's displeasure and stirred up rough hatred in mine uncle lincoln's breast
o love how powerful art thou that canst change high birth to baseness and a noble mind to the mean semblance of a shoemaker
but thus it must be
for her cruel father hating the single union of our souls has secretly conveyed my rose from london to bar me of her presence but i trust fortune and this disguise will further me once more to view her beauty gain her sight
here in tower street with eyre the shoemaker mean i a while to work i know the trade i learnt it when i was in wittenberg
then cheer thy hoping spirits be not dismayed thou canst not want do fortune what she can the gentle craft is living for a man

five long hours both armies fought together at the length the lot of victory fell on our side
twelve thousand of the frenchmen that day died four thousand english and no man of name but captain hyam and young ardington two gallant gentlemen i knew them well
but dodger prithee tell me in this fight how did my cousin lacy bear himself
my lord your cousin lacy was not there
no my good lord
i saw him shipped and a thousand eyes beside were witnesses of the farewells which he gave when i with weeping eyes bid him adieu
my lord i am advised that what i spake is true to prove it so his cousin askew that supplied his place sent me for him from france that secretly he might convey himself thither
dares he so carelessly venture his life upon the indignation of a king
has he despised my love and spurned those favours which i with prodigal hand poured on his head
he shall repent his rashness with his soul since of my love he makes no estimate i'll make him wish he had not known my hate
thou hast no other news
none else my lord
none worse i know thou hast
procure the king to crown his giddy brows with ample honours send him chief colonel and all my hope thus to be dashed
but 'tis in vain to grieve one evil cannot a worse relieve
upon my life i have found out his plot that old dog love that fawned upon him so love to that puling girl his fair cheeked rose the lord mayor's daughter hath distracted him and in the fire of that love's lunacy hath he burnt up himself consumed his credit lost the king's love yea and i fear his life only to get a wanton to his wife dodger it is so
i fear so my good lord
it is so nay sure it cannot be
i am at my wits' end
thou art acquainted with my nephew's haunts spend this gold for thy pains go seek him out watch at my lord mayor's there if he live dodger thou shalt be sure to meet with him
lacy thy name lived once in honour now 'tis dead in shame
i warrant you my lord
london a room in the house
enter the and master mayor
good master scott i have been bold with you to be a witness to a wedding knot betwixt young master hammon and my daughter
o stand aside see where the lovers come
can it be possible you love me so
no no within those eyeballs i espy apparent likelihoods of flattery
pray now let go my hand
sweet mistress rose misconstrue not my words nor misconceive of my affection whose devoted soul swears that i love thee dearer than my heart
as dear as your own heart
i judge it right men love their hearts best when th'are out of sight
i love you by this hand
yet hands off now
if flesh be frail how weak and frail's your vow
then by my life i swear
then do not brawl one quarrel loseth wife and life and all
is not your meaning thus
in faith you jest
love loves to sport therefore leave love y'are best
square they master scott
sir never doubt lovers are quickly in and quickly out
sweet rose be not so strange in fancying me
nay never turn aside shun not my sight i am not grown so fond to fond my love on any that shall quit it with disdain if you will love me so if not farewell
why how now lovers are you both agreed
yes faith my lord
'tis well give me your hand
give me yours daughter
how now both pull back
what means this girl
i mean to live a maid
but not to die one pause ere that be said
will you still cross me still be obstinate
nay chide her not my lord for doing well if she can live an happy virgin's life 'tis far more blessed than to be a wife
say sir i cannot i have made a vow whoever be my husband 'tis not you
your tongue is quick but master hammon know i bade you welcome to another end
what would you have me pule and pine and pray with 'lovely lady' 'mistress of my heart' 'pardon your servant' and the rhymer play railing on cupid and his tyrant's dart or shall i undertake some martial spoil wearing your glove at tourney and at tilt and tell how many gallants i unhorsed sweet will this pleasure you
yea when wilt begin
what love rhymes man
fie on that deadly sin
if you will have her i'll make her agree
enforced love is worse than hate to me
there is a wench keeps shop in the old change to her will i it is not wealth i seek i have enough and will prefer her love before the world
my good lord mayor adieu
old love for me i have no luck with new
now mammet you have well behaved yourself but you shall curse your coyness if i live
see you convey your mistress straight to th'old ford
i'll keep you straight enough
fore god i would have sworn the puling girl would willingly accepted hammon's love but banish him my thoughts
exit now tell me master scott would you have thought that master simon eyre the shoemaker had been of wealth to buy such merchandise
'twas well my lord your honour and myself grew partners with him for your bills of lading shew that eyre's gains in one commodity rise at the least to full three thousand pound besides like gain in other merchandise
well he shall spend some of his thousands now for i have sent for him to the guildhall
enter see where he comes
good morrow master eyre
poor simon eyre my lord your shoemaker
well well it likes yourself to term you so
enter now master dodger what's the news with you
i'd gladly speak in private to your honour
you shall you shall
master eyre and master scott i have some business with this gentleman i pray let me entreat you to walk before to the guildhall i'll follow presently
master eyre i hope ere noon to call you sheriff
i would not care my lord if you might call me king of spain
now master dodger what's the news you bring
the earl of lincoln by me greets your lordship and earnestly requests you if you can inform him where his nephew lacy keeps
is not his nephew lacy now in france
no i assure your lordship but disguised lurks here in london
it may be but upon my faith and soul i know not where he lives or whether he lives so tell my lord of lincoln
well master dodger you perhaps may start him be but the means to rid him into france i'll give you a dozen angels for your pains so much i love his honour hate his nephew
and prithee so inform thy lord from me
i take my leave
farewell good master dodger lacy in london
i dare pawn my life my daughter knows thereof and for that cause denied young master hammon in his love
well i am glad i sent her to old ford

hum let's be merry whiles we are young old age sack and sugar will steal upon us ere we be aware
during the time when this play was performed seems to have appropriated these words of eyre's and turned them into rhyme in these lines "let's now take our time while we're in our prime and old old age is afar off for the evil evil days will come on apace before we can be aware of
" three men's songs are printed separately from the rest of the play and the place for their insertion is only very uncertainly indicated
o the month of may the merry month of may so frolick so gay and so green so green so green
o and then did i unto my true love say "sweet peg thou shalt be my summer's queen
"now the nightingale the pretty nightingale the sweetest singer in all the forest's choir entreats thee sweet peggy to hear thy true love's tale lo yonder she sitteth her breast against a brier
"but o i spy the cuckoo the cuckoo the cuckoo see where she sitteth come away my joy come away i prithee i do not like the cuckoo should sing where my peggy and i kiss and toy
" o the month of may the merry month of may so frolick so gay and so green so green so green
and then did i unto my true love say "sweet peg thou shalt be my summer's queen
it's well done mistress eyre pray give good counsel to my daughter
i hope mistress rose will have the grace to take nothing that's bad
pray god she do for i' faith mistress eyre i would bestow upon that peevish girl a thousand marks more than i mean to give her upon condition she'd be ruled by me the ape still crosseth me
there came of late a proper gentleman of fair revenues whom gladly i would call son in law but my fine cockney would have none of him
you'll prove a coxcomb for it ere you die a courtier or no man must please your eye
be ruled sweet rose th'art ripe for a man
marry not with a boy that has no more hair on his face than thou hast on thy cheeks
a courtier wash go by stand not upon pishery pashery those silken fellows are but painted images outsides outsides rose their inner linings are torn
no my fine mouse marry me with a gentleman grocer like my lord mayor your father a grocer is a sweet trade plums plums
had i a son or daughter should marry out of the generation and blood of the shoemakers he should pack what the gentle trade is a living for a man through europe through the world
a noise within of a tabor and a pipe
what noise is this
o my lord mayor a crew of good fellows that for love to your honour are come hither with a morris dance
come in my mesopotamians cheerily
enter and other ~shoemakers~ in a morris after a little dancing the speaks
master eyre are all these shoemakers
all cordwainers my good lord mayor
how like my lacy looks yond' shoemaker
o that i durst but speak unto my love
sybil go fetch some wine to make these drink
you are all welcome
we thank your lordship
takes a cup of wine and goes to rose
for his sake whose fair shape thou represent'st good friend i drink to thee
ic bedancke good frister
i see mistress rose you do not want judgment you have drunk to the properest man i keep
here be some have done their parts to be as proper as he
well urgent business calls me back to london good fellows first go in and taste our cheer and to make merry as you homeward go spend these two angels in beer at stratford bow
to these two my mad lads sim eyre adds another then cheerily firk tickle it hans and all for the honour of shoemakers
all go dancing out
come master eyre let's have your company
sybil what shall i do
why what's the matter
that hans the shoemaker is my love lacy disguised in that attire to find me out
how should i find the means to speak with him
what mistress never fear i dare venture my maidenhead to nothing and that's great odds that hans the dutchman when we come to london shall not only see and speak with you but in spite of all your father's policies steal you away and marry you
will not this please you
do this and ever be assured of my love
away then and follow your father to london lest your absence cause him to suspect something to morrow if my counsel be obeyed i'll bind you prentice to the gentle trade
a street in london
in a seamster's shop working enter ~master~ muffled he stands aloof
yonder's the shop and there my fair love sits
she's fair and lovely but she is not mine
o would she were
thrice have i courted her thrice hath my hand been moistened with her hand whilst my poor famished eyes do feed on that which made them famish
i am unfortunate i still love one yet nobody loves me
i muse in other men what women see that i so want
fine mistress rose was coy and this too curious
oh no she is chaste and for she thinks me wanton she denies to cheer my cold heart with her sunny eyes
how prettily she works oh pretty hand
it doth me good to stand unseen to see her
thus i oft have stood in frosty evenings a light burning by her enduring biting cold only to eye her
one only look hath seemed as rich to me as a king's crown such is love's lunacy
muffled i'll pass along and by that try whether she know me
sir what is't you buy
what is't you lack sir calico or lawn fine cambric shirts or bands what will you buy
that which thou wilt not sell
faith yet i'll try how do you sell this handkerchief
and how these ruffs
and how this band
all cheap how sell you then this hand
my hands are not to be sold
to be given then
nay faith i come to buy
but none knows when
good sweet leave work a little while let's play
i cannot live by keeping holiday
i'll pay you for the time which shall be lost
with me you shall not be at so much cost
look how you wound this cloth so you wound me
it may be so
nay faith you are too coy
let go my hand
i will do any task at your command i would let go this beauty were i not in mind to disobey you by a power that controls kings i love you
with hands i may but never with my heart
in faith i love you
i believe you do
shall a true love in me breed hate in you
i hate you not
then you must love
what are you better now
i love not you
all this i hope is but a woman's fray that means come to me when she cries away
in earnest mistress i do not jest a true chaste love hath entered in my breast
i love you dearly as i love my life i love you as a husband loves a wife that and no other love my love requires thy wealth i know is little my desires thirst not for gold
sweet beauteous jane what's mine shall if thou make myself thine all be thine
say judge what is thy sentence life or death
mercy or cruelty lies in thy breath
good sir i do believe you love me well for 'tis a silly conquest silly pride for one like you i mean a gentleman to boast that by his love tricks he hath brought such and such women to his amorous lure i think you do not so yet many do and make it even a very trade to woo
i could be coy as many women be feed you with sunshine smiles and wanton looks but i detest witchcraft say that i do constantly believe you constant have ham
why dost thou not believe me
i believe you but yet good sir because i will not grieve you with hopes to taste fruit which will never fall in simple truth this is the sum of all my husband lives at least i hope he lives
pressed was he to these bitter wars in france bitter they are to me by wanting him
i have but one heart and that heart's his due
how can i then bestow the same on you
whilst he lives his i live be it ne'er so poor and rather be his wife than a king's whore
chaste and dear woman i will not abuse thee although it cost my life if thou refuse me
thy husband pressed for france what was his name
here's a letter sent from france to me from a dear friend of mine a gentleman of place here he doth write their names that have been slain in every fight
i hope death's scroll contains not my love's name
to my remembrance such a name i read amongst the rest
ay me he's dead
if this be true my dear heart's slain
have patience dear love
nay sweet jane make not poor sorrow proud with these rich tears
i mourn thy husband's death because thou mourn'st
that bill is forged 'tis signed by forgery
i'll bring thee letters sent besides to many carrying the like report jane 'tis too true
come weep not mourning though it rise from love helps not the mourned yet hurts them that mourn
for god's sake leave me
whither dost thou turn
forget the dead love them that are alive his love is faded try how mine will thrive
'tis now no time for me to think on love
'tis now best time for you to think on love because your love lives not
though he be dead my love to him shall not be buried for god's sake leave me to myself alone
'twould kill my soul to leave thee drowned in moan
answer me to my suit and i am gone say to me yea or no
one farewell will not serve i come again come dry these wet cheeks tell me faith sweet jane yea or no once more
once more i say no once more be gone i pray else will i go
nay then i will grow rude by this white hand until you change that cold "no" here i'll stand till by your hard heart jane
nay for god's love peace
my sorrows by your presence more increase
not that you thus are present but all grief desires to be alone therefore in brief thus much i say and saying bid adieu if ever i wed man it shall be you
dear jane i'll urge no more thy breath hath made me rich
death makes me poor

paul's also was a parish church of st
faith commonly called st
by this shoe said he
how am i amazed at this strange accident
upon my life this was the very shoe i gave my wife when i was pressed for france since when alas
i never could hear of her it is the same and hammon's bride no other but my jane
'snails ralph thou hast lost thy part of three pots a countryman of mine gave me to breakfast
i care not i have found a better thing
is it a man's thing or a woman's thing
firk dost thou know this shoe
no by my troth neither doth that know me
i have no acquaintance with it 'tis a mere stranger to me
why then i do this shoe i durst be sworn once covered the instep of my jane
this is her size her breadth thus trod my love these true love knots i pricked i hold my life by this old shoe i shall find out my wife
old shoe that wert new
how a murrain came this ague fit of foolishness upon thee
thus firk even now here came a serving man by this shoe would he have a new pair made against to morrow morning for his mistress that's to be married to a gentleman
and why may not this be my sweet jane
and why may'st not thou be my sweet ass
well laugh and spare not
but the truth is this against to morrow morning i'll provide a lusty crew of honest shoemakers to watch the going of the bride to church
if she prove jane i'll take her in despite from hammon and the devil were he by
if it be not my jane what remedy
hereof i am sure i shall live till i die although i never with a woman lie
thou lie with a woman to build nothing but cripple gates
well god sends fools fortune and it may be he may light upon his matrimony by such a device for wedding and hanging goes by destiny

oh i did fear such cross mishaps did reign that i should never see my rose again
sweet lacy since fair opportunity offers herself to further our escape let not too over fond esteem of me hinder that happy hour
invent the means and rose will follow thee through all the world
oh how i surfeit with excess of joy made happy by thy rich perfection
but since thou pay'st sweet interest to my hopes redoubling love on love let me once more like to a bold faced debtor crave of thee this night to steal abroad and at eyre's house who now by death of certain aldermen is mayor of london and my master once meet thou thy lacy where in spite of change your father's anger and mine uncle's hate our happy nuptials will we consummate

do not reply love which gave strength to bear my father's hate shall now add wings to further our escape
another room in the same house
enter the and the mayor
believe me on my credit i speak truth since first your nephew lacy went to france i have not seen him
it seemed strange to me when dodger told me that he stayed behind neglecting the high charge the king imposed
trust me sir roger oateley i did think your counsel had given head to this attempt drawn to it by the love he bears your child
here i did hope to find him in your house but now i see mine error and confess my judgment wronged you by conceiving so
lodge in my house say you
trust me my lord i love your nephew lacy too too dearly so much to wrong his honour and he hath done so that first gave him advice to stay from france
to witness i speak truth i let you know how careful i have been to keep my daughter free from all conference or speech of him not that i scorn your nephew but in love i bear your honour lest your noble blood should by my mean worth be dishonoured
how far the churl's tongue wanders from his heart
well well sir roger oateley i believe you with more than many thanks for the kind love so much you seem to bear me
but my lord let me request your help to seek my nephew whom if i find i'll straight embark for france
so shall your rose be free my thoughts at rest and much care die which now lies in my breast

where is my daughter rose

my lord i come to bring unwelcome news
your nephew lacy and your daughter rose early this morning wedded at the savoy none being present but the lady mayoress
besides i learnt among the officers the lord mayor vows to stand in their defence 'gainst any that shall seek to cross the match
dares eyre the shoemaker uphold the deed
yes sir shoemakers dare stand in a woman's quarrel i warrant you as deep as another and deeper too
besides his grace to day dines with the mayor who on his knees humbly intends to fall and beg a pardon for your nephew's fault
but i'll prevent him
come sir roger oateley the king will do us justice in this cause
howe'er their hands have made them man and wife i will disjoin the match or lose my life
oh if they had stayed i would have so lambed them with flouts
o heart my codpiece point is ready to fly in pieces every time i think upon mistress rose but let that pass as my lady mayoress says

let's march together for the honour of saint hugh to the great new hall in gracious street corner which our master the new lord mayor hath built
o the crew of good fellows that will dine at my lord mayor's cost to day

there's cheer for the heavens venison pasties walk up and down piping hot like sergeants beef and brewess comes marching in dry vats fritters and pancakes comes trowling in in wheel barrows hens and oranges hopping in porters' baskets collops and eggs in scuttles and tarts and custards comes quavering in in malt shovels
whoop look here look here
how now mad lads whither away so fast
why to the great new hall know you not why
the lord mayor hath bidden all the prentices in london to breakfast this morning
oh brave shoemaker oh brave lord of incomprehensible good fellowship
the pancake bell rings

and this shall continue for ever
come come my hearts
o eternal credit to us of the gentle craft
march fair my hearts
a street in london
enter the and his ~train~ across the stage
is our lord mayor of london such a gallant
one of the merriest madcaps in your land
your grace will think when you behold the man he's rather a wild ruffian than a mayor
yet thus much i'll ensure your majesty
in all his actions that concern his state he is as serious provident and wise as full of gravity amongst the grave as any mayor hath been these many years
i am with child till i behold this huff cap
but all my doubt is when we come in presence his madness will be dashed clean out of countenance
it may be so my liege
which to prevent let some one give him notice 'tis our pleasure that he put on his wonted merriment
enter and other ~shoemakers~ all with napkins on their shoulders
come my fine hodge my jolly gentlemen shoemakers soft where be these cannibals these varlets my officers
let them all walk and wait upon my brethren for my meaning is that none but shoemakers none but the livery of my company shall in their satin hoods wait upon the trencher of my sovereign
o my lord it will be rare
no more firk come lively
let your fellow prentices want no cheer let wine be plentiful as beer and beer as water
hang these penny pinching fathers that cram wealth in innocent lamb skins
look to my guests
my lord we are at our wits' end for room those hundred tables will not feast the fourth part of them
then cover me those hundred tables again and again till all my jolly prentices be feasted
frisk about my nimble firk
carouse me fathom healths to the honour of the shoemakers
do they drink lively hodge
do they tickle it firk
some of them have taken their liquor standing so long that they can stand no longer but for meat they would eat it an they had it
where's this swag belly this greasy kitchenstuff cook
call the varlet to me
firk hodge lame ralph run my tall men beleaguer the shambles beggar all eastcheap serve me whole oxen in chargers and let sheep whine upon the tables like pigs for want of good fellows to eat them
your lordship mistakes my man firk he means their bellies want meat not the boards for they have drunk so much they can eat nothing
cold's the wind and wet's the rain saint hugh be our good speed ill is the weather that bringeth no gain nor helps good hearts in need
trowl the bowl the jolly nut brown bowl and here kind mate to thee let's sing a dirge for saint hugh's soul and down it merrily

firk frisk about and about and about for the honour of mad simon eyre lord mayor of london
and to marlowe's tamburlaine though these were long after eyre's time
hey for the honour of the shoemakers
an open yard before the hall
a long flourish or two
enter the nobles and kneel
well lacy though the fact was very foul of your revolting from our kingly love and your own duty yet we pardon you
rise both and mistress lacy thank my lord mayor for your young bridegroom here
so my dear liege sim eyre and my brethren the gentlemen shoemakers shall set your sweet majesty's image cheek by jowl by saint hugh for this honour you have done poor simon eyre
i beseech your grace pardon my rude behaviour i am a handicraftsman yet my heart is without craft i would be sorry at my soul that my boldness should offend my king
nay i pray thee good lord mayor be even as merry as if thou wert among thy shoemakers it does me good to see thee in this humour
say'st thou me so my sweet dioclesian
prince am i none yet am i princely born
by the lord of ludgate my liege i'll be as merry as a pie
tell me in faith mad eyre how old thou art
my liege a very boy a stripling a younker you see not a white hair on my head not a gray in this beard
every hair i assure thy majesty that sticks in this beard sim eyre values at the king of babylon's ransom tamar cham's beard was a rubbing brush to't yet i'll shave it off and stuff tennis balls with it to please my bully king
shakespeare's much ado about nothing act sc
but all this while i do not know your age
my liege i am six and fifty year old yet i can cry humph
with a sound heart for the honour of saint hugh
mark this old wench my king i danced the shaking of the sheets with her six and thirty years ago and yet i hope to get two or three young lord mayors ere i die
i am lusty still sim eyre still
care and cold lodging brings white hairs
my sweet majesty let care vanish cast it upon thy nobles it will make thee look always young like apollo and cry humph
prince am i none yet am i princely born
say cornwall didst thou ever see his like
not i my lord
enter the and the king
lincoln what news with you
my gracious lord have care unto yourself for there are traitors here
traitors in my house
where be my officers
i'll spend my soul ere my king feel harm
where is the traitor lincoln
cornwall lay hold on lacy
lincoln speak what canst thou lay unto thy nephew's charge
this my dear liege your grace to do me honour heaped on the head of this degenerate boy desertless favours you made choice of him to be commander over powers in france
good lincoln prithee pause a while
even in thine eyes i read what thou wouldst speak
i know how lacy did neglect our love ran himself deeply in the highest degree into vile treason lincoln
is he not a traitor
lincoln he was now have we pardoned him
'twas not a base want of true valour's fire that held him out of france but love's desire
i will not bear his shame upon my back
nor shalt thou lincoln i forgive you both
then good my liege forbid the boy to wed one whose mean birth will much disgrace his bed
are they not married
shall i divorce them then
o be it far that any hand on earth should dare untie the sacred knot knit by god's majesty i would not for my crown disjoin their hands that are conjo√Øned in holy nuptial bands
how say'st thou lacy wouldst thou lose thy rose
not for all india's wealth my sovereign
but rose i am sure her lacy would forego
if rose were asked that question she'd say no
you hear them lincoln
yea my liege i do
yet canst thou find i'th' heart to part these two
who seeks besides you to divorce these lovers
i do my gracious lord i am her father
sir roger oateley our last mayor i think
the same my liege
would you offend love's laws
well you shall have your wills you sue to me to prohibit the match
soft let me see you both are married lacy art thou not
i am dread sovereign
then upon thy life i charge thee not to call this woman wife
i thank your grace
o my most gracious lord
nay rose never woo me i tell you true although as yet i am a bachelor yet i believe i shall not marry you
can you divide the body from the soul yet make the body live
i cannot rose but you i must divide
this fair maid bridegroom cannot be your bride
are you pleased lincoln
oateley are you pleased
then must my heart be eased for credit me my conscience lives in pain till these whom i divorced be joined again
lacy give me thy hand rose lend me thine
be what you would be
at night lovers to bed
now let me see which of you all mislikes this harmony
will you then take from me my child perforce
why tell me oateley shines not lacy's name as bright in the world's eye as the gay beams of any citizen
yea but my gracious lord i do mislike the match far more than he her blood is too too base
dost thou not know that love respects no blood cares not for difference of birth or state
the maid is young well born fair virtuous a worthy bride for any gentleman
besides your nephew for her sake did stoop to bare necessity and as i hear forgetting honours and all courtly pleasures to gain her love became a shoemaker
as for the honour which he lost in france thus i redeem it lacy kneel thee down
arise sir rowland lacy
tell me now tell me in earnest oateley canst thou chide seeing thy rose a lady and a bride
i am content with what your grace hath done
and i my liege since there's no remedy
come on then all shake hands i'll have you friends where there is much love all discord ends
what says my mad lord mayor to all this love
o my liege this honour you have done to my fine journeyman here rowland lacy and all these favours which you have shown to me this day in my poor house will make simon eyre live longer by one dozen of warm summers more than he should
nay my mad lord mayor that shall be thy name if any grace of mine can length thy life one honour more i'll do thee that new building which at thy cost in cornhill is erected shall take a name from us we'll have it called the leadenhall because in digging it you found the lead that covereth the same
leadenhall at his proper expense as it now appears and gave the same to the city to be employed as a public granary for laying up corn against a time of scarcity
i thank your majesty
god bless your grace
lincoln a word with you
enter and more ~shoemakers~
how now my mad knaves
peace speak softly yonder is the king
with the old troop which there we keep in pay we will incorporate a new supply
before one summer more pass o'er my head france shall repent england was injured
what are all those
all shoemakers my liege sometime my fellows in their companies i lived as merry as an emperor
my mad lord mayor are all these shoemakers
all shoemakers my liege all gentlemen of the gentle craft true trojans courageous cordwainers they all kneel to the shrine of holy saint hugh
god save your majesty
mad simon would they anything with us
i'll do't i warrant you
they are all beggars my liege all for themselves and i for them all on both my knees do entreat that for the honour of poor simon eyre and the good of his brethren these mad knaves your grace would vouchsafe some privilege to my new leadenhall that it may be lawful for us to buy and sell leather there two days a week
mad sim i grant your suit you shall have patent to hold two market days in leadenhall mondays and fridays those shall be the times
will this content you
jesus bless your grace
in the name of these my poor brethren shoemakers i most humbly thank your grace
but before i rise seeing you are in the giving vein and we in the begging grant sim eyre one boon more
what is it my lord mayor
vouchsafe to taste of a poor banquet that stands sweetly waiting for your sweet presence
i shall undo thee eyre only with feasts already have i been too troublesome say have i not
o my dear king sim eyre was taken unawares upon a day of shroving which i promised long ago to the prentices of london
for an't please your highness in time past i bare the water tankard and my coat sits not a whit the worse upon my back and then upon a morning some mad boys it was shrove tuesday even as 'tis now gave me my breakfast and i swore then by the stopple of my tankard if ever i came to be lord mayor of london i would feast all the prentices
this day my liege i did it and the slaves had an hundred tables five times covered they are gone home and vanished yet add more honour to the gentle trade taste of eyre's banquet simon's happy made
eyre i will taste of thy banquet and will say i have not met more pleasure on a day
friends of the gentle craft thanks to you all thanks my kind lady mayoress for our cheer
come lords a while let's revel it at home
when all our sports and banquetings are done wars must right wrongs which frenchmen have begun
