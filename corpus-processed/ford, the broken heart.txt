he whose best of art hath drawn this piece calls it the title lends no expectation here of apish laughter or of some lame jeer at place or persons no pretended clause of jests fit for a brothel courts applause from vulgar admiration such low songs tun'd to unchaste ears suit not modest tongues
the virgin sisters then deserv'd fresh bays when innocence and sweetness crown'd their lays then vices gasp'd for breath whose whole commerce was whipp'd to exile by unblushing verse
this law we keep in our presentment now not to take freedom more than we allow what may be here thought fiction when time's youth wanted some riper years was known a truth in which if words have cloth'd the subject right you may partake a pity with delight
i enter and crot
dally not further i will know the reason that speeds thee to this journey
good sir i can yield many
give me one a good one such i expect and ere we part must have
pray why to athens
you intend not	 to kick against the world turn cynic stoic or read the logic lecture or become an areopagite and judge in cases touching the commonwealth for as i take it the budding of your chin cannot prognosticate so grave an honour
all this i acknowledge
then son if books and love of knowledge inflame you to this travel here in sparta you may as freely study
is not that sir
as a father i command thee	 to acquaint me with the truth
thus i obey ye
after so many quarrels as dissension fury and rage had broacht in blood and some times with death to such confederates as sided with now dead thrasus and yourself my lord our present king amyclas reconcil'd	 your eager swords and seal'd a gentle peace friends you profest yourselves which to con firm a resolution for a lasting league betwixt your families was entertain'd	 by joining in a hymenean bond me and the fair penthea only daughter to thrasus
much much dear sir
a freedom of converse an interchange of holy and chaste love so fixt our souls	 in a firm growth of union that no time can eat into the pledge we had enjoy'd the sweets our vows expected had not cruelty prevented all those triumphs we prepar'd for by thrasus his untimely death
from this time sprouted up that poison ous stalk of aconite whose ripened fruit hath ravisht all health all comfort of a happy life for ithocles her brother proud of youth and prouder in his power nourisht closely	 the memory of former discontents to glory in revenge
by cunning partly partly by threats 'a woos at once and forces his virtuous sister to admit a marriage with bassanes a nobleman in honour	 and riches i confess beyond my fortunes
all this is no sound reason to impor tune my leave for thy departure
beauteous penthea wedded to this torture by an insulting brother being secretly	 compell'd to yield her virgin freedom up to him who never can usurp her heart before contracted mine is now so yok'd to a most barbarous thraldrom misery affliction that he savours not humanity	 whose sorrow melts not into more than pity in hearing but her name
bassanes the man that calls her wife considers truly what heaven of perfections he is lord of by thinking fair penthea his this thought	 begets a kind of monster love which love is nurse unto a fear so strong and servile as brands all dotage with a jealousy all eyes who gaze upon that shrine of beauty he doth resolve do homage to the miracle	 some one he is assur'd may now or then if opportunity but sort prevail
so much out of a self unworthiness his fears transport him not that he finds cause in her obedience but his own distrust
you spin out your discourse
my griefs are violent for knowing how the maid was heretofore courted by me his jealousies grow wild that i should steal again into her favours and undermine her virtues which the gods	 know i nor dare nor dream of
hence from hence i undertake a voluntary exile first by my absence to take off the cares of jealous bassanes but chiefly sir to free penthea from a hell on earth	 lastly to lose the memory of something her presence makes to live in me afresh
enough my orgilus enough
to ath ens i give a full consent
we shall hear from thee often
see	 thy sister comes to give a farewell
euphranea thus upon thy cheeks i print a brother's kiss more careful of thine honour thy health and thy well doing than my life
before we part in presence of our father	 i must prefer a suit t' ye
you may style it my brother a command
that you will promise to pass never to any man however worthy your faith till with our father's leave i give a free consent
i'll promise for her orgilus
your pardon euphranea's oath must yield me satisfaction
by vesta's sacred fires i swear
and i by great apollo's beams join in the vow not without thy allowance to bestow her	 on any living
dear euphranea mistake me not far far 't is from my thought as far from any wish of mine to hinder preferment to an honourable bed or fitting fortune thou art young and hand some	 and 't were injustice more a tyranny not to advance thy merit
trust me sister it shall be my first care to see thee match'd as may become thy choice and our contents
i have your oath
but mean you brother to leave us as you say
ay ay euphranea he has just grounds direct him
i will prove a father and a brother to thee
heaven does look into the secrets of all hearts gods you have mercy with ye else crot
doubt nothing	 thy brother will return in safety to us
souls sunk in sorrows never are without 'em
they change fresh airs but bear their griefs about 'em
enter the king courtiers and attendants
the spartan gods are gracious our humility shall bend before their altars and perfume their temples with abundant sacrifice
see lords amyclas your old king is ent'ring into his youth again
i shall shake off	 this silver badge of age and change this snow for hairs as gay as are apollo's locks our heart leaps in new vigour

he is so madam in which the period of my fate consists he in this firmament of honour stands like a star fixt not mov'd with any thunder of popular applause or sudden lightning	 of self opinion he hath serv'd his country and thinks 't was but his duty

i use not before this royal presence these fit slights as in contempt of such as can direct	 my speech hath other end not to attribute all praise to one man's fortune which is strengthen'd by many hands
for instance here is prophilus a gentleman i cannot flatter truth of much desert and though in other rank	 both hemophil and groneas were not missing to wish their country's peace for in a word all there did strive their best and 't was our duty
we vouch safe our hand
and kiss his hand
observe your great example
some repose after these toils is needful
we must think on conditions for the conquered they expect 'em

if my fortune run such a crooked by way as to wrest my steps to ruin yet thy learned precepts shall call me back and set my footings straight
i will not court the world
ah orgilus	 neglects in young men of delights and life run often to extremities they care not for harms to others who contemn their own
but i most learned artist am not so much at odds with nature that i grudge the thrift	 of any true deserver nor doth malice of present hopes so check them with despair as that i yield to thought of more affliction than what is incident to frailty wherefore impute not this retired course of living	 some little time to any other cause than what i justly render the information of an unsettled mind as the effect must clearly witness
spirit of truth inspire thee
on these conditions i conceal thy change	 and willingly admit thee for an auditor

love thou art full of mystery
the deities themselves are not secure in searching out the secrets of those flames which hidden waste a breast made tributary to the laws of beauty physic yet hath never found	 a remedy to cure a lover's wound
who are those that cross yon private walk into the shadowing grove in amorous foldings
passeth over supporting and whispering
't is euphranea with prophilus supported too

i should but repeat a lesson oft conn'd without a prompter but thine eyes
my love is honourable
aside so was mine to my penthea chastely honourable
nor wants there more addition to my wish	 of happiness than having thee a wife already sure of ithocles a friend firm and unalterable
but a brother more cruel than the grave
what can you look for in answer to your noble protestations	 from an unskilful maid but language suited to a divided mind
know prophilus i never undervalu'd from the first time you mentioned worthy love your merit means or person it had been	 a fault of judgment in me and a dulness in my affections not to weigh and thank my better stars that offered me the grace of so much blissfulness
for to speak truth the law of my desires kept equal pace	 with yours nor have i left that resolution but only in a word whatever choice lives nearest in my heart must first procure consent both from my father and my brother ere he can own me his

leave me that task
my brother ere he parted to athens had my oath
yes yes 'a had sure

sir we are overheard
was a stirring sir of some one near
your fears are needless lady	 none have access into these private pleasures except some near in court or bosom student from tecnicus his oratory granted by special favour lately from the king unto the grave philosopher
methinks	 i hear one talking to himself i see him
is a poor scholar as i told you lady
half aloud to himself as if studying
say it is it possible with a smooth tongue a leering countenance flattery or force of reason i come t' ye sir 	 to turn or to appease the raging sea

call you this thing a scholar
observe him sweet 't is but his recrea tion
but will you hear a little
you're so tetchy you keep no rule in argument
philosophy	 works not upon impossibilities but natural conclusions
the metaphysics are but speculations of the celestial bodies or such accidents as not mixt perfectly in the air engend'red	 appear to us unnatural that's all
prove it yet with a reverence to your gravity i'll balk illiterate sauciness submitting my sole opinion to the touch of writers
now let us fall in with him
these apish boys when they but taste the grammates and principles of theory imagine they can oppose their teachers
confidence leads many into errors
by your leave sir
are you a scholar friend
i am gay creature	 with pardon of your deities a mushroom on whom the dew of heaven drops now and then the sun shines on me too i thank his beams
sometime i feel their warmth and eat and sleep
does tecnicus read to thee
he is my master surely yonder door opens upon his study
such people toil not sweet in heats of state nor sink in thaws of greatness their affections keep order with the limits of their modesty	 their love is love of virtue
aplotes sumptuous master a poor wretch
dost thou want anything
lady a new conceit comes in my thought and most available for both our comforts
whiles i endeavour to deserve your father's blessing to our loves this scholar may daily at some certain hours attend what notice i can write of my success	 here in this grove and give it to your hands the like from you to me so can we never barr'd of our mutual speech want sure intelli gence and thus our hearts may talk when our tongues cannot
occasion is most favourable use it
aplotes wilt thou wait us twice a day at nine i' the morning and at four at night	 here in this bower to convey such letters as each shall send to other
do it willingly safely and secretly and i will furnish thy study or what else thou canst desire
jove make me thankful thankful i beseech thee propitious jove
i will prove sure and trusty
you will not fail me books
nor aught besides thy heart can wish
this lady's name's eu phranea mine prophilus
i have a pretty memory	 it must prove my best friend
i will not miss one minute of the hours appointed
write the books thou wouldst have bought thee in a note or take thyself some money
no no money money to scholars is a spirit invisible	 we dare not finger it or books or nothing
books of what sort thou wilt do not forget our names
i warrant ye i warrant ye
smile hymen on the growth of our desires we'll feed thy torches with eternal fires
put out thy torches hymen or their light shall meet a darkness of eternal night
inspire me mercury with swift deceits
ingenious fate has leapt into mine arms beyond the compass of my brain
mortality	 creeps on the dung of earth and cannot reach the riddles which are purpos'd by the gods
great arts best write themselves in their own stories they die too basely who outlive their glories
i'll have that window next the street damm'd up it gives too full a prospect to temptation and courts a gazer's glances
there's a lust committed by the eye that sweats and trav ails plots wakes contrives till the deformed bear whelp	 adultery be lick'd into the act the very act
that light shall be damm'd up ye hear sir
i do hear my lord a mason shall be provided suddenly
some rogue some rogue of your confederacy factor 	 for slaves and strumpets
to convey close packets from this spruce springal and t' other young ster that gaudy earwig or my lord your patron whose pensioner you are
i'll tear thy throat out son of a cat ill looking hound's head rip up	 thy ulcerous maw if i but scent a paper a scroll but half as big as what can cover a wart upon thy nose a spot a pimple directed to my lady it may prove a mystical preparative to lewdness
care shall be had i will turn every thread about me to an eye
here's a sweet life
the city housewives cunning in the traffic of chamber merchandise set all at price by wholesale yet they wipe their mouths and simper	 cull kiss and cry "sweetheart" and stroke the head which they have branch'd and all is well again
dull clods of dirt who dare not feel the rubs stuck on their foreheads
is a villanous world one cannot hold his own in 't
dames at court	 who flaunt in riots run another bias their pleasure heaves the patient ass that suf fers up on the stilts of office titles incomes promotion justifies the shame and sues for 't
poor honour thou art stabb'd and bleed'st to death	 by such unlawful hire
the country mistress is yet more wary and in blushes hides whatever trespass draws her troth to guilt
but all are false on this truth i am bold no woman but can fall and doth or would
now for the newest news about the city	 what blab the voices sirrah
o my lord the rarest quaintest strangest tickling news that ever bass
up and ride me rascal
forsooth they say the king has mew'd 	 all his gray beard instead of which is budded another of a pure carnation colour speckled with green and russet
yes truly and 't is talkt about the streets that since lord ithocles came home the lions never left roaring at which noise the bears	 have danc'd their very hearts out
dance out thine too
besides lord orgilus is fled to athens upon a fiery dragon and 't is thought never can return
moreover please your lordship 't is re ported for certain that whoever is found jealous without apparent proof that 's wife is wanton shall be divorc'd but this is but she news i had it from a midwife
i have more yet
idiots and stupid fools grate my calamities
why to be fair should yield presumption of a faulty soul look to the doors
the horn of plenty crest him
swarms of confusion huddle in my thoughts	 in rare distemper
o it is an unmatcht blessing or a horrid curse
enter and an old lady
she comes she comes
so shoots the morning forth spangled with pearls of transparent dew
the way to poverty is to be rich	 as i in her am wealthy but for her in all contents a bankrupt
how fares my heart's best joy
in sooth not well she is so over sad
thy brother is return'd sweet safe and hon our'd	 with a triumphant victory thou shalt visit him we will to court where if it be thy pleasure thou shalt appear in such a ravishing lustre of jewels above value that the dames who brave it there in rage to be outshin'd	 shall hide them in their closets and unseen fret in their tears whiles every wond'ring eye shall crave none other brightness but thy pres ence
choose thine own recreations be a queen of what delights thou fanciest best what com pany	 what place what times do anything do all things youth can command so thou wilt chase these clouds from the pure firmament of thy fair looks
now 't is well said my lord
laugh be merry time is precious
alas my lord this language to your hand maid sounds as would music to the deaf i need no braveries nor cost of art to draw the whiteness of my name into offence let such if any such there are who covet	 a curiosity of admiration by laying out their plenty to full view appear in gaudy outsides my attires shall suit the inward fashion of my mind from which if your opinion nobly plac'd	 change not the livery your words bestow my fortunes with my hopes are at the highest
this house methinks stands some what too much inward it is too melancholy we'll remove	 nearer the court or what thinks my penthea of the delightful island we command
rule me as thou canst wish
i am no mistress
whither you please i must attend all ways are alike pleasant to me
a prison is as gaysome we'll no islands	 marry out upon 'em
whom shall we see there
sea gulls and porpoises and water rats and crabs and mews and dog fish goodly gear for a young lady's dealing or an old one's
on no terms islands i'll be stew'd first
aside to grausis	 you are a juggling bawd
this sadness sweetest becomes not youthful blood
aside to i'll have you pounded
for my sake put on a more cheerful mirth thou 'lt mar thy cheeks and make me old in griefs
aside to damnable bitch fox
i am thick of hearing	 still when the wind blows southerly
what think ye if your fresh lady breed young bones my lord
would not a chopping boy d'ye good at heart
but as you said bass
aside to i'll spit thee on a stake or chop thee into collops
sure sure the wind blows south still
is very hot i sweat extremely
a herd of lords sir
a flock of ladies
caroches in drifts th' one enter th' other stand with out sir	 and now i vanish
most welcome prophilus ladies gen tlemen to all my heart is open you all honour me aside
a tympany swells in my head al ready honour me bountifully
how they flutter	 wagtails and jays together
from your brother by virtue of your love to him i require your instant presence fairest
he is well sir
the gods preserve him ever
yet dear beauty i find some alteration in him lately	 since his return to sparta
my good lord i pray use no delay
we had not needed an invitation if his sister's health had not fallen into question
haste penthea slack not a minute
lead the way good prophilus	 i'll follow step by step
your arm fair madam
exeunt all but and bass
one word with your old bawdship th' hadst been better rail'd at the sins thou worshipp'st than have thwarted my will i'll use thee cursedly
you dote you are beside yourself
a politician	 in jealousy
no y' are too gross too vulgar
pish teach not me my trade i know my cue
my crossing you sinks me into her trust by which i shall know all my trade's a sure one
forgive me grausis 't was considera tion	 i relish'd not but have a care now
i am no new come to 't
thy life's upon it and so is mine
my agonies are infinite
't is of vipers' breed it gnaws a passage through the womb that gave it mo tion
ambition like a seeled dove mounts upward higher and higher still to perch on clouds but tumbles headlong down with heavier ruin
so squibs and crackers fly into the air then only breaking with a noise they vanish in stench and smoke
morality appli'd to timely practice keeps the soul in tune at whose sweet music all our actions dance	 but this is form of books and school tradition it physics not the sickness of a mind broken with griefs strong fevers are not eas'd with counsel but with best receipts and means means speedy means and certain that's the cure
you stick lord crotolon upon a point too nice and too unnecessary prophilus is every way desertful
i am confident your wisdom is too ripe to need instruction from your son's tutelage
yet not so ripe	 my lord armostes that it dares to dote upon the painted meat of smooth persuasion which tempts me to a breach of faith
not yet resolv'd my lord
why if your son's consent be so available we'll write to athens	 for his repair to sparta
the king's hand will join with our desires he has been mov'd to 't
yes and the king himself impórtun'd crotolon for a dispatch
kings may command their wills are laws not to be questioned
by this marriage	 you knit an union so devout so hearty between your loves to me and mine to yours as if mine own blood had an interest in it for prophilus is mine and i am his
my lord my lord
had this sincerity been real once my orgilus had not been now unwiv'd nor your lost sister buried in a bride bed
your uncle here armostes knows this truth for had your father thrasus liv'd but peace dwell in his grave
are bold and bitter
presses home the injury it smarts
no reprehensions uncle i deserve 'em
yet gentle sir consider what the heat of an unsteady youth a giddy brain	 green indiscretion flattery of greatness rawness of judgment wilfulness in folly thoughts vagrant as the wind and as uncertain might lead a boy in years to 't was a fault a capital fault for then i could not dive	 into the secrets of commanding love since when experience by the extremes in others hath forc'd me collect
and trust me croto lon i will redeem those wrongs with any service your satisfaction can require for current
the acknowledgment is satisfaction what would you more
i'm conquer'd if euphranea herself admit the motion let it be so i doubt not my son's liking
use my fortunes life power sword and heart all are your own
the princess with your sister
i present ye a stranger here in court my lord for did not desire of seeing you draw her abroad we had not been made happy in her company
you are a gracious princess
sister wedlock	 holds too severe a passion in your nature which can engross all duty to your husband without attendance on so dear a mistress
to is not my brother's pleasure i presume immure her in a chamber
is her will	 she governs her own hours
noble ithocles we thank the gods for your success and wel fare our lady has of late been indispos'd else we had waited on you with the first
how does penthea now
you best know brother	 from whom my health and comforts are de riv'd
i like the answer well 't is sad and modest
there may be tricks yet tricks
have an eye grausis
now crotolon the suit we join'd in must not fall by too long demur
is granted princess	 for my part
with condition that his son favour the contract
such delay is easy
the joys of marriage make thee prophilus a proud deserver of euphranea's love and her of thy desert
the joys of marriage are the heaven on earth life's paradise great princess the soul's quiet sinews of concord earthly immortality eternity of pleasures no restoratives like to a constant woman
but where is she
would puzzle all the gods but to create such a new monster
i can speak by proof for i rest in elysium 't is my happiness
euphranea how are you resolv'd speak freely in your affections to this gentleman
nor more nor less than as his love as sures me which if your liking with my brother's war rants i cannot but approve in all points worthy
to i know your answer
had been pity to sunder hearts so equally consented
the king lord ithocles commands your presence and fairest princess yours
we will attend him
where are the lords
all must unto the king without delay the prince of argos cal
is coming to the court sweet lady
the prince of argos
was my fortune madam enjoy the honour of these happy tidings
let me an hour hence meet you alone within the palace grove	 i have some secret with you
prithee friend conduct her thither and have special care the walks be clear'd of any to disturb us
alone pray be alone
i am your creature princess
exeunt all but bass
what means that word "alone"
why might not i be there
brothers and sisters are but flesh and blood and this same whoreson court ease is tempta tion to a rebellion in the veins besides	 his fine friend prophilus must be her guar dian why may not he dispatch a business nimbly before the other come
or pand'ring pan d'ring for one another be 't to sister mother wife cousin anything 'mongst youths of mettle is in request it is so stubborn fate
but if i be a cuckold and can know it i will be fell and fell
my lord y 'are call'd for
most heartily i thank ye
where's my wife pray
retir'd amongst the ladies
still i thank ye
there 's an old waiter with her saw you her too
she sits i 'th' presence lobby fast asleep sir
is your lordship troubled
you will not to the king
your servant my good lord
i wait your footsteps
in this walk lady will your brother find you and with your favour give me leave a little to work a preparation
in his fashion i have observ'd of late some kind of slackness to such alacrity as nature once	 and custom took delight in sadness grows upon his recreations which he hoards in such a willing silence that to question the grounds will argue little skill in friendship and less good manners
sir i'm not inquisitive	 of secrecies without an invitation
with pardon lady not a syllable of mine implies so rude a sense the drift enter disguised as before
to do thy best to make this lady merry for an hour
your will shall be a law sir
prithee leave me i have some private thoughts i would account with use thou thine own
speak on fair nymph our souls can dance as well to music of the spheres as any's who have feasted with the gods
your school terms are too troublesome
what heaven refines mortality from dross of earth but such as uncompounded beauty hallows with glorified perfection
set thy wits in a less wild proportion
time can never	 on the white table of unguilty faith write counterfeit dishonour turn those eyes the arrows of pure love upon that fire which once rose to a flame perfum'd with vows as sweetly scented as the incense smoking	 on vesta's altars
the holiest odours virgin's tears
sprinkled like dews to feed 'em and to increase their fervour
all pleasures are but mere imagination feeding the hungry appetite with steam	 and sight of banquet whilst the body pines not relishing the real taste of food such is the leanness of a heart divided from intercourse of troth contracted loves	 no horror should deface that precious figure seal'd with the lively stamp of equal souls
some fury hath bewitch'd thy tongue
the breath of ignorance that flies from thence ripens a knowledge in me of afflictions	 above all suff'rance
thing of talk begone
be just penthea in thy commands when thou send'st forth a doom of banishment know first on whom it lights
thus i take off the shroud in which my cares	 are folded up from view of common eyes
throws of his scholar's dress
what is thy sentence next
thou layest a blemish on mine honour with the hazard of thy too desperate life yet i profess by all the laws of ceremonious wedlock	 i have not given admittance to one thought of female change since cruelty enforc'd divorce betwixt my body and my heart
why would you fall from goodness thus
o rather examine me how i could live to say	 i have been much much wrong'd
is for thy sake i put on this imposture dear penthea if thy soft bosom be not turn'd to marble thou 'lt pity our calamities my interest confirms me thou art mine still
lend your hand	 with both of mine i clasp it thus thus kiss it thus kneel before ye
you instruct my duty
we may stand up
have you aught else to urge of new demand
as for the old forget it is buried in an everlasting silence	 and shall be shall be ever
what more would ye
i would possess my wife the equity of very reason bids me
why 't is the all of me myself
remove your steps some distance from me at this space	 a few words i dare change but first put on your borrowed shape
you are obey'd 't is done
he resumes his disguise
how orgilus by promise i was thine the heavens do witness they can witness too a rape done on my truth how i do love thee	 yet orgilus and yet must best appear in tendering thy freedom for i find the constant preservation of thy merit by thy not daring to attempt my fame with injury of any loose conceit	 which might give deeper wounds to discon tents
continue this fair race then though i cannot add to thy comfort yet i shall more often remember from what fortune i am fallen	 and pity mine own ruin
live live happy happy in thy next choice that thou mayst peo ple this barren age with virtues in thy issue
and o when thou art married think on me with mercy not contempt
i hope thy wife hearing my story will not scorn my fall
now let us part
yet advise thee better penthea is the wife to orgilus and ever shall be
never shall nor will
hear me in a word i'll tell thee why
the virgin dowry which my birth bestow'd	 is ravish'd by another my true love abhors to think that orgilus deserv'd no better favours than a second bed
i must not take this reason
to confirm it should i outlive my bondage let me meet	 another worse than this and less desir'd if of all men alive thou shouldst but touch my lip or hand again
penthea now i tell ye you grow wanton in my sufferance come sweet th' art mine
or i can turn affection into vengeance your reputation if you value any lies bleeding at my feet
unworthy man if ever henceforth thou appear in language message or letter to betray my frailty	 i'll call thy former protestations lust and curse my stars for forfeit of my judgment
go thou fit only for disguise and walks to hide thy shame this once i spare thy life
i laugh at mine own confidence my sorrows by thee are made inferior to my fortunes
if ever thou didst harbour worthy love dare not to answer
my good genius guide me that i may never see thee more
i'll tear my veil of politic french off and stand up like a man resolv'd to do	 action not words shall show me
sighed my name sure as he parted from me i fear i was too rough
alas poor gentleman look'd not like the ruins of his youth	 but like the ruins of those ruins
honour how much we fight with weakness to preserve thee
damn thee rotten mag got damn thee
aches con vulsions imposthumes rheums gouts palsies clog thy bones	 a dozen years more yet
now y' are in humours
she's by herself there's hope of that she's sad too she's in strong contemplation yes and fixt the signs are wholesome
hold your chops nightmare
lady come your brother	 is carried to his closet you must thither
not well my lord
a sudden fit 't will off
some surfeit or disorder
your news is none o' the best
the chief of men the excellentest ithocles desires	 your presence madam
we are hasting to him
in vain we labour in this course of life to piece our journey out at length or crave respite of breath our home is in the grave
then let us care	 to live so that our reckonings may fall even when we 're to make account
he cannot fear who builds on noble grounds sickness or pain is the deserver's exercise and such your virtuous brother to the world is known
speak comfort to him lady be all gentle	 stars fall but in the grossness of our sight a good man dying th' earth doth lose a light
enter and in his own shape
be well advis'd let not a resolution of giddy rashness choke the breath of reason
it shall not most sage master
i am jealous for if the borrowed shape so late put on inferr'd a consequence we must conclude	 some violent design of sudden nature hath shook that shadow off to fly upon a new hatch'd execution
orgilus take heed thou hast not under our integrity shrouded unlawful plots our mortal eyes	 pierce not the secrets of your heart the gods are only privy to them
learned tecnicus such doubts are causeless and to clear the truth from misconceit the present state commands me
the prince of argos comes himself in person	 in quest of great calantha for his bride our kingdom's heir besides mine only sister euphranea is dispos'd to prophilus lastly the king is sending letters for me to athens for my quick repair to court	 please to accept these reasons
just ones orgilus not to be contradicted yet beware of an unsure foundation no fair colours can fortify a building faintly jointed
i have observ'd a growth in thy aspéct	 of dangerous extent sudden and look to 't i might add certain org
could art run through mine inmost thoughts it should not sift an inclination there more than what suited with justice of mine honour
but know then orgilus what honour is
honour consists not in a bare opinion by doing any act that feeds content brave in appearance 'cause we think it brave such honour comes by accident not nature	 proceeding from the vices of our passion which makes our reason drunk but real hon our is the reward of virtue and acquir'd by justice or by valour which for basis hath justice to uphold it
he then fails	 in honour who for lucre or revenge commits thefts murders treasons and adul teries with suchlike by intrenching on just laws whose sovereignty is best preserv'd by justice
thus as you see how honour must be grounded on knowledge not opinion for opinion	 relies on probability and accident but knowledge on necessity and truth i leave thee to the fit consideration of what becomes the grace of real honour	 wishing success to all thy virtuous meanings
the gods increase thy wisdom reverend oracle and in thy precepts make me ever thrifty
i thank thy wish
much mystery of fate lies hid in that man's fortunes curiosity	 may lead his actions into rare attempts but let the gods be moderators still no human power can prevent their will
enter with a casket
from whence come ye
from king amyclas pardon my interruption of your studies
here	 in this seal'd box he sends a treasure to you dear to him as his crown
prays your grav ity you would examine ponder sift and bolt the pith and circumstance of every tittle the scroll within contains
what is 't armostes
it is the health of sparta the king's life sinews and safety of the commonwealth the sum of what the oracle deliver'd when last he visited the prophetic temple at delphos what his reasons are for which	 after so long a silence he requires your counsel now grave man his majesty will soon himself acquaint you with
apollo inspire my intellect
the prince of argos is entertain'd
he is and has demanded	 our princess for his wife which i conceive one special cause the king importunes you for resolution of the oracle
my duty to the king good peace to sparta and fair day to armostes
soft music during which time enter passing over the stage
and enter again softly stealing to several stands and listen
a can you paint a thought
or number every fancy in a slumber
can you count soft minutes roving from a dial's point by moving
can you grasp a sigh
or lastly	 rob a virgin's honour chastely
yet you may sooner do both that and this this and that and never miss than by any praise display	 beauty 's beauty such a glory as beyond all fate all story all arms all arts all loves all hearts greater than those or they	 do shall and must obey
all silent calm secure
not a mouse or whisper of the wind
the floor is matted the bedposts sure are steel or marble
sol diers	 should not affect methinks strains so effem inate sounds of such delicacy are but fawnings upon the sloth of luxury they heighten cinders of covert lust up to a flame
what do you mean my lord
speak low that gabbling	 of yours will but undo us
chamber combats are felt not heard
all quit the room else
lord bassanes your brother would be private we must forbear his sleep hath newly left him
by any means 't is fit
pray gentlewoman walk too
yes i will sir
discovered in a chair and beside him
sit nearer sister to me nearer yet
we had one father in one womb took life	 were brought up twins together yet have liv'd at distance like two strangers
i could wish that the first pillow whereon i was cradled had prov'd to me a grave
you had been happy then had you never known that sin of life which blots all following glories with a ven geance	 for forfeiting the last will of the dead from whom you had your being
sad penthea thou canst not be too cruel my rash spleen hath with a violent hand pluck'd from thy bosom a love blest heart to grind it into dust	 for which mine 's now a breaking
not yet heaven i do beseech thee
first let some wild fires scorch not consume it
may the heat be cher isht with desires infinite but hopes impossible
wrong'd soul thy prayers are heard
here lo i breathe	 a miserable creature led to ruin by an unnatural brother
i consume in languishing affections for that trespass yet cannot die
the handmaid to the wages	 of country toil drinks the untroubled streams with leaping kids and with the bleating lambs and so allays her thirst secure whiles i quench my hot sighs with fleetings of my tears
the labourer doth eat his coarsest bread earn'd with his sweat and lies him down to sleep	 while every bit i touch turns in digestion to gall as bitter as penthea's curse
put me to any penance for my tyranny and i will call thee merciful
pray kill me rid me from living with a jealous husband	 then we will join in friendship be again brother and sister
kill me pray nay will ye
how does thy lord esteem thee
such an one as only you have made me a faith breaker a spotted whore forgive me i am one	 in act not in desires the gods must witness
thou dost belie thy friend
i do not ithocles for she that's wife to orgilus and lives in known adultery with bassanes is at the best a whore
wilt kill me now
the ashes of our parents will assume some dreadful figure and appear to charge thy bloody guilt that hast betray'd their name to infamy in this reproachful match
after my victories abroad at home	 i meet despair ingratitude of nature hath made my actions monstrous
thou shalt stand a deity my sister and be worshipp'd for thy resolved martyrdom wrong'd maids and married wives shall to thy hallowed shrine	 offer their orisons and sacrifice pure turtles crown'd with myrtle if thy pity unto a yielding brother's pressure lend one finger but to ease it
death waits to waft me to the stygian banks	 and free me from this chaos of my bondage and till thou wilt forgive i must endure
who is the saint you serve
friendship or nearness of birth to any but my sister durst not have mov'd that question 't is a secret sister	 i dare not murmur to myself
let me by your new protestations i conjure ye partake her name
't is 't is i dare not
all your respects are forg'd
calantha is the princess the king's daugh ter 	 sole heir of sparta
me most miserable do i now love thee
for my injuries revenge thyself with bravery and gossip my treasons to the king's ears do calantha knows it not yet nor prophilus ray nearest
suppose you were contracted to her would it not split even your very soul to see her father snatch her out of your arms against her will and force her on the prince of argos
trouble not the fountains of mine eyes with thine own story	 i sweat in blood for't
alas sir being children but two branches of one stock 't is not fit we should divide have comfort you may find it
yes in thee only in thee penthea mine
if sorrows	 have not too much dull'd my infected brain i'll cheer invention for an active strain
why have i wrong'd a maid so excellent
enter with a poniard and bass
i can forbear no longer more i will not
keep off your hands or fall upon my point
patience is tir'd for like a slow pac'd ass	 ye ride my easy nature and proclaim my sloth to vengeance a reproach and property
the meaning of this rudeness
o my griev'd lord
sweet lady come not near him	 he holds his perilous weapon in his hand to prick 'a cares not whom nor where see see see
my birth is noble though the popu lar blast of vanity as giddy as thy youth hath rear'd thy name up to bestride a cloud	 or progress in the chariot of the sun i am no clod of trade to lackey pride nor like your slave of expectation wait the bawdy hinges of your doors or whistle for mystical conveyance to your bed sports
how 'a stares struts puffs and sweats
but that i may conceive the spirit of wine has took possession of your soberer custom i'd say you were unmannerly
smooth formality is usher to the rankness of the blood but impudence bears up the train
indeed sir your fiery mettle or your springal blaze of huge renown is no sufficient royalty	 to print upon my forehead the scorn "cuck old
his jealousy has robb'd him of his wits talks 'a knows not what
yes and 'a knows to whom 'a talks to one that franks his lust in swine security of bestial incest
i will haloo 't though i blush more to name the filthiness than thou to act it
sir by our friendship pen
by our bloods will you quite both undo us brother
these are his megrims firks and melancho lies
well said old touch hole
kick him out of doors
with favour let me speak
my lord what slackness in my obedience hath deserv'd this rage
except humility and silent duty have drawn on your unquiet my simplicity	 ne'er studied your vexation
light of beauty deal not ungently with a desperate wound
no breach of reason dares make war with her whose looks are sovereignty whose breath is balm
o that i could preserve thee in fruition	 as in devotion
sir may every evil lock'd in pandora's box shower in your pre sence on my unhappy head if since you made me a partner in your bed i have been faulty in one unseemly thought against your honour
purge not his griefs penthea
yes say on	 excellent creature
to good be not a hindrance to peace and praise of virtue
o my senses are charm'd with sounds celestial
on dear on i never gave you one ill word say did indeed i did not
nor by juno's forehead was i o'er guilty of a wanton error
no but for penance
noble sir what is it
with gladness i embrace it yet pray let not my rashness teach you to be too unmerciful
when you shall show good proof that manly wisdom not oversway'd by passion or opinion knows how to lead your judgment then this lady your wife my sister shall return in safety	 home to be guided by you but till first i can out of clear evidence approve it she shall be my care
rip my bosom up i'll stand the execution with a constancy this torture is unsufferable
well sir	 i dare not trust her to your fury
but penthea says not so
she needs no tongue to plead excuse who never purpos'd wrong
virgin of reverence and antiquity stay you behind
to the court wants not your diligence
exeunt all but and grau
what will you do my lord
my lady's gone i am deni'd to follow
i may see her or speak to her once more
and feel her too man be of good cheer she 's your own flesh and bone
diseases desperate must find cures alike
she swore she has been true
true on my modesty
let him want truth who credits not her vows
much wrong i did her but her brother infinite rumour will voice me the contempt of man hood	 should i run on thus
some way i must try to outdo art and jealousy decry
enter leading and amy
cousin of argos what the heavens have pleas'd in their unchanging counsels to conclude for both our kingdoms' weal we must submit to nor can we be unthankful to their bounties who when we were even creeping to our grave	 sent us a daughter in whose birth our hope continues of succession
as you are in title next being grandchild to our aunt so we in heart desire you may sit nearest calantha's love since we have ever vow'd	 not to enforce affection by our will but by her own choice to confirm it gladly
you speak the nature of a right just father
i come not hither roughly to demand my cousin's thraldom but to free mine own
report of great calantha's beauty virtue sweetness and singular perfections courted all ears to credit what i find was publish'd by constant truth from which if any service of my desert can purchase fair construction	 this lady must command it
princely sir so well you know how to profess observance that you instruct your hearers to become practitioners in duty of which number i'll study to be chief
chief glorious virgin	 in my devotions as in all men's wonder
excellent cousin we deny no liberty use thine own opportunities
armostes we must consult with the philosophers the business is of weight
sir at your pleasure
you told me crotolon your son's re turn'd from athens wherefore comes he not to court as we commanded
he shall soon attend your royal will great sir
the marriage between young prophilus and euphranea	 tastes of too much delay
some pleasures at celebration of it would give life to th' entertainment of the prince our kins man our court wears gravity more than we relish
yet the heavens smile on all your high attempts	 without a cloud
so may the gods protect us
a prince a subject
yes to beauty's sceptre as all hearts kneel so mine
you are too courtly
your safe return to sparta is most wel come i joy to meet you here and as occasion	 shall grant us privacy will yield you reasons why i should covet to deserve the title of your respected friend for without compli ment believe it orgilus 't is my ambition
your lordship may command me your poor servant
what sudden change is next
life to the king
to whom i here present this noble gentleman new come from athens royal sir vouchsafe your gracious hand in favour of his merit
the king gives his hand to kiss
my son preferr'd by ithocles
our bounties shall open to thee orgilus for instance hark in thine ear if out of those inventions which flow in athens thou hast there en grost some rarity of wit to grace the nuptials	 of thy fair sister and renown our court in th' eyes of this young prince we shall be debtor to thy conceit think on 't
your highness honours me
my tongue and heart are twins
a noble birth becoming such a father
worthy orgilus	 you are a guest most wish'd for
may my duty still rise in your opinion sacred princess
euphranea's brother sir a gentleman well worthy of your knowledge
we embrace him proud of so dear acquaintance
all prepare	 for revels and disport the joys of hymen like phoebus in his lustre put to flight all mists of dulness crown the hours with gladness no sounds but music no discourse but mirth
thine arm i prithee ithocles
nay good	 my lord keep on your way i am provided
i dare not disobey
the king hath spoke his mind
his will he hath but were it lawful to hold plea against the power of greatness not the reason haply such undershrubs as subjects sometimes might borrow of nature justice to inform	 that license sovereignty holds without check over a meek obedience
how resolve you touching your sister's marriage
prophilus is a deserving and a hopeful youth
i envy not his merit but applaud it	 could wish him thrift in all his best desires and with a willingness inleague our blood with his for purchase of full growth in friend ship
he never touch'd on any wrong that malic'd the honour of our house nor stirr'd our peace yet with your favour let me not forget	 under whose wing he gathers warmth and com fort whose creature he is bound made and must live so
son son i find in thee a harsh condi tion no courtesy can win it 't is too rancorous
good sir be not severe in your construc tion i am no stranger to such easy calms as sit in tender bosoms lordly ithocles hath grac'd my entertainment in abundance too humbly hath descended from that height	 of arrogance and spleen which wrought the rape on griev'd penthea's purity his scorn of my untoward fortunes is reclaim'd unto a courtship almost to a fawning i 'll kiss his foot since you will have it so
since i will have it so
friend i will have it so without our ruin by your politic plots or wolf of hatred snarling in your breast
you have a spirit sir have ye
a familiar that posts i' th' air for your intelligence
some such hobgoblin hurried you from athens for yet you come unsent for
if unwelcome i might have found a grave there
sure your business was soon dispatch'd or your mind alter'd quickly
was care sir of my health cut short my journey	 for there a general infection threatens a desolation
and i fear thou hast brought back a worse infection with thee infection of thy mind which as thou say'st threatens the desolation of our family
forbid it our dear genius
i will rather be made a sacrifice on thrasus' monument or kneel to ithocles his son in dust than woo a father's curse
my sister's mar riage with prophilus is from my heart confirm'd	 may i live hated may i die despis'd if i omit to further it in all that can concern me
i have been too rough
my duty to my king made me so earnest excuse it orgilus
here comes	 euphranea with prophilus and ithocles
your true friend on earth not any truer
with smooth eyes look on this worthy couple your consent can only make them one
sister	 thou pawn'dst to me an oath of which engage ment i never will release thee if thou aim'st at any other choice than this
dear brother at him or none
to which my blessing 's added
which till a greater ceremony per fect 	 euphranea lend thy hand here take her prophilus live long a happy man and wife and further that these in presence may conclude an omen thus for a bridal song i close my wishes sings
comforts lasting loves increasing	 like soft hours never ceasing plenty's pleasure peace complying without jars or tongues envying hearts by holy union wedded more than theirs by custom bedded fruitful issues life so graced not by age to be defaced budding as the year ensu'th every spring another youth all what thought can add beside	 crown this bridegroom and this bride
you have seal'd joy close to my soul
euphranea now i may call thee mine
i but exchange one good friend for another
if these gallants will please to grace a poor invention	 by joining with me in some slight device i'll venture on a strain my younger days have studied for delight
with thankful willingness i offer my attendance
no endeavour of mine shall fail to show itself
we will	 all join to wait on thy directions orgilus
o my good lord your favours flow towards a too unworthy worm but as you please i am what you will shape me
i thank thee son for this acknowledg ment	 it is a sight of gladness
whoe'er would speak with us deny his entrance be careful of our charge
except the king himself give none ad mittance not any
madam it shall be our care
being alone penthea you have granted the opportunity you sought and might	 at all times have commanded
is a benefit which i shall owe your goodness even in death for
my glass of life sweet princess hath few minutes remaining to run down the sands are spent for by an inward messenger i feel	 the summons of departure short and certain
you feel too much your melancholy
glories of human greatness are but pleasing dreams and shadows soon decaying on the stage	 of my mortality my youth hath acted some scenes of vanity drawn out at length by varied pleasures sweet'ned in the mixture but tragical in issue beauty pomp with every sensuality our giddiness	 doth frame an idol are unconstant friends when any troubled passion makes assault on the unguarded castle of the mind
contemn not your condition for the proof of bare opinion only to what end	 reach all these moral texts
to place before ye a perfect mirror wherein you may see how weary i am of a ling'ring life who count the best a misery
indeed you have no little cause yet none so great	 as to distrust a remedy
that remedy must be a winding sheet a fold of lead and some untrod on corner in the earth
not to detain your expectation princess i have an humble suit
speak i enjoy it
vouchsafe then to be my executrix and take that trouble on ye to dispose such legacies as i bequeath impartially
i have not much to give the pains are easy heaven will reward your piety and thank it	 when i am dead for sure i must not live i hope i cannot
now beshrew thy sadness thou turn'st me too much woman
her fair eyes melt into passion
then i have assurance encouraging my boldness
in this paper	 my will was character'd which you with par don shall now know from mine own mouth
talk on prithee it is a pretty earnest
i have left me but three poor jewels to bequeath
the first is my youth for though i am much old in griefs in years i am a child
to whom that jewel
to virgin wives such as abuse not wed lock by freedom of desires but covet chiefly the pledges of chaste beds for ties of love	 rather than ranging of their blood and next to married maids such as prefer the number of honourable issue in their virtues before the flattery of delights by marriage may those be ever young
you mean to part with
is my fame i trust	 by scandal yet untouch'd this i bequeath to memory and time's old daughter truth
if ever my unhappy name find mention when i am fall'n to dust may it deserve beseeming charity without dishonour
how handsomely thou play'st with harmless sport of mere imagination
i strangely like thy will
this jewel madam is dearly precious to me you must use the best of your discretion to employ	 this gift as intend it
do not doubt me
is long agone since first i lost my heart long i have liv'd without it else for certain i should have given that too but instead of it to great calantha sparta's heir	 by service bound and by affection vow'd i do bequeath in holiest rites of love mine only brother ithocles
impute not heaven blest lady to am bition a faith as humbly perfect as the prayers	 of a devoted suppliant can endow it
look on him princess with an eye of pity how like the ghost of what he late appear'd moves before you
shall i answer here or lend my ear too grossly
first his heart	 shall fall in cinders scorch'd by your disdain ere he will dare poor man to ope an eye on these divine looks but with low bent thoughts accusing such presumption as for words dares not utter any but of service	 yet this lost creature loves ye
be a princess in sweetness as in blood give him his doom or raise him up to comfort
what new change appears in my behaviour that thou dar'st tempt my displeasure
i must leave the world	 to revel in elysium and 't is just to wish my brother some advantage here yet by my best hopes ithocles is ignorant of this pursuit
but if you please to kill him lend him one angry look or one harsh word	 and you shall soon conclude how strong a power your absolute authority holds over his life and end
you have forgot penthea how still i have a father
but remember i am a sister though to me this brother	 hath been you know unkind o most unkind
christalla philema where are ye
lady your check lies in my silence
re enter and chris
i think ye sleep ye drones wait on penthea unto her lodging
my reckonings are made even death or fate can now nor strike too soon nor force too late
forbear your inquisition curiosity is of too subtle and too searching nature in fears of love too quick too slow of credit
i am not what you doubt me
nephew be then as i would wish all is not right
good heaven	 confirm your resolutions for dependence on worthy ends which may advance your quiet
i did the noble orgilus much injury but griev'd penthea more i now repent it now uncle now this "now" is now too late
so provident is folly in sad issue	 that after wit like bankrupts' debts stands tallied without all possibilities of payment
sure he's an honest very honest gentleman a man of single meaning
i believe it 	 yet nephew 't is the tongue informs our ears our eyes can never pierce into the thoughts for they are lodg'd too inward but i ques tion no truth in orgilus the princess sir
with her the prince of argos
great fair one grace my hopes with any instance of livery from the allowance of your favour this little spark attempts to take a ring from her finger
love feasts on toys for cupid is a child vouchsafe this bounty it cannot be deni'd
you shall not value	 sweet cousin at a price what i count cheap so cheap that let him take it who dares stoop for 't and give it at next meeting to a mistress she 'll thank him for 't perhaps
casts the ring to ame
the ring sir is the princess's i could have took it up
to the blessed owner upon my knees kneels and offers it to near
i am belike "a mistress" wondrous pretty
let the man keep his fortune since he found it he's worthy on 't
to follow spaniel	 i 'll force ye to a fawning else
my lord you were too forward
look ye uncle some such there are whose liberal contents swarm without care in every sort of plenty who after full repasts can lay them down	 to sleep and they sleep uncle in which si lence their very dreams present 'em choice of pleas ures pleasures observe me uncle of rare object here heaps of gold there increments of hon ours now change of garments then the votes of people	 anon varieties of beauties courting in flatteries of the night exchange of dalliance yet these are still but dreams
give me felic ity of which my senses waking are partakers a real visible material happiness	 and then too when i stagger in expectance of the least comfort that can cherish life
i saw it sir i saw it for it came from her own hand
the princess threw it t' ye
true and she said well i remember what 	 her cousin prince would beg it
yes and parted in anger at your taking on 't
panthea o thou hast pleaded with a powerful language
i want a fee to gratify thy merit but i will do arm
what is 't you say
in anger let him part for could his breath like whirlwinds toss such servile slaves as lick the dust his footsteps print into a vapour it durst not stir a hair of mine it should not i'd rend it up by th' roots first
to be any thing	 calantha smiles on is to be a blessing more sacred than a petty prince of argos can wish to equal or in worth or title
contain yourself my lord ixion aim ing to embrace juno bosom'd but a cloud	 and begat centaurs 't is an useful moral
ambition hatch'd in clouds of mere opinion proves but in birth a prodigy
i thank ye yet with your licence i should seem unchari table to gentler fate if relishing the dainties	 of a soul's settled peace i were so feeble not to digest it
he deserves small trust who is not privy counsellor to himself
re enter and with near
your excellence mistakes his temper for ithocles in fashion of his mind	 is beautiful soft gentle the clear mirror of absolute perfection
was 't your modesty term'd any of the prince's servants "spaniel"
your nurse sure taught you other language
a gallant man at arms is here a doctor	 in feats of chivalry blunt and rough spoken vouchsafing not the fustian of civility which less rash spirits style good manners
no more illustrious sir 't is matchless ithocles
you might have understood who i am
i did else but the presence calm'd th' af front are cousin to the princess
to the king too a certain instrument that lent supportance to you colossic greatness to that king too you might have added
there is more divinity in beauty than in majesty
this odd youth's pride turns heretic in loyalty
low mushrooms never rival cedars
what pitiful dull thing am i so to be tamely scolded at
let him come back and echo once again that scornful sound of mushroom
painted colts like heralds' coats gilt o'er with crowns and sceptres may bait a muzzled lion
cousin cousin thy tongue is not thy friend
in point of honour	 discretion knows no bounds
amelus told me was all about a little ring
a ring the princess threw away and i took up
admit she threw 't to me what arm of brass can snatch it hence
no could he grind the hoop	 to powder 'a might sooner reach my heart than steal and wear one dust on 't
orgilus i am extremely wrong'd
a lady's favour is not to be so slighted
quiet these vain unruly passions which will render into a madness
griefs will have their vent
enter with a scroll
welcome thou com'st in season rev erend man to pour the balsam of a suppling patience into the festering wound of ill spent fury
what makes he here
the hurts are yet but mortal	 which shortly will prove deadly
to the king armostes see in safety then deliver this seal'd up counsel bid him with a con stancy peruse the secrets of the gods
o sparta o lacedaemon
double nam'd but one	 in fate when kingdoms reel mark well my saw their heads must needs be giddy
tell the king that henceforth he no more mast inquire after my aged head apollo wills it so i am for delphos
not without some conference	 with our great master
never more to see him a greater prince commands me
ithocles when youth is ripe and age from time doth part the lifeless trunk shall wed the broken heart
what's this if understood
list orgilus	 remember what i told thee long before these tears shall be my witness
let craft with courtesy a while confer revenge proves its own executioner
dark sentences are for apollo's priests i am not oedipus
my hour is come	 cheer up the king farewell to all
o sparta o lacedaemon
if prophetic fire have warm'd this old man's bosom we might construe his words to fatal sense
leave to the powers	 above us the effects of their decrees my burthen lies within me servile fears prevent no great effects
the gods be still propitious
something oddly the book man prated yet 'a talk'd it weeping let craft with courtesy a while confer	 revenge proves its own executioner
con it again for what
it shall not puzzle me is dotage of a withered brain
penthea forbade me not her presence i may see her and gaze my fill
why see her then i may	 when if i faint to speak i must be silent
pray use your recreations all the ser vice i will expect is quietness amongst ye take liberty at home abroad at all times and in your charities appease the gods whom i with my distractions have offended
fair blessings on thy heart
here 's a rare change
my lord to cure the itch is surely gelded the cuckold in conceit hath cast his horns
betake ye to your several occasions and wherein i have heretofore been faulty	 let your constructions mildly pass it over
henceforth i'll study reformation more i have not for employment

beasts only capable of sense enjoy the benefit of food and ease with thankful ness such silly creatures with a grudging kick not against the portion nature hath bestow'd	 but men endow'd with reason and the use of reason to distinguish from the chaff of abject scarcity the quintessence soul and elixir of the earth's abundance	 the treasures of the sea the air nay heaven repining at these glories of creation are verier beasts than beasts and of those beasts the worst am i i who was made a monarch of what a heart could wish for a chaste wife 	 endeavour'd what in me lay to pull down that temple built for adoration only and level 't in the dust of causeless scandal
but to redeem a sacrilege so impious humility shall pour before the deities	 i have incenst a largess of more patience than their displeased altars can require no tempests of commotion shall disquiet the calms of my composure
i have found thee thou patron of more horrors than the bulk	 of manhood hoop'd about with ribs of iron can cram within thy breast penthea bas sanes curst by thy jealousies more by thy dot age is left a prey to words
exercise your trials for addition to my penánce	 i am resolv'd

why dost not laugh
divine and best of ladies please to forget my outrage mercy ever cannot but lodge under a roof so excellent
i have cast off that cruelty of frenzy which once appear'd imposture and then juggled to cheat my sleeps of rest

the turtle sighs when he hath lost his mate and yet some say he must be dead first

griefs are sure friends they leave without control nor cure nor comforts for a leprous soul

we are haunted and must use exorcism to conjure down this spirit of malevolence
i come not sir to chide your late dis order admitting that th' inurement to a roughness in soldiers of your years and fortunes chiefly so lately prosperous hath not yet shook off the custom of the war in hours of leisure	 nor shall you need excuse since y' are to ren der account to that fair excellence the princess who in her private gallery expects it from your own mouth alone i am a messenger but to her pleasure
excellent nearchus	 be prince still of my services and conquer without the combat of dispute i honour ye
the king is on a sudden indispos'd physicians are call'd for 't were fit armostes you should be near him
sir i kiss your hands
amelus i perceive calantha's bosom is warm'd with other fires than such as can take strength from any fuel of the love i might address to her
young ithocles or ever i mistake is lord ascendant	 of her devotions one to speak him truly in every disposition nobly fashioned
but can your highness brook to be so rivall'd considering the inequality of the persons
i can amelus for affections injur'd by tyranny or rigour of compulsion like tempest threat'ned trees unfirmly rooted ne'er spring to timely growth observe for in stance life spent penthea and unhappy orgilus
how does your grace determine
to be jealous	 in public of what privately i'll further and though they shall not know yet they shall find it

our daughter is not near
she is retir'd sir
where's the prince our cousin
new walk'd into the grove my lord
all leave us except armostes and you crotolon we would be private
health unto your majesty
he is to delphos and to your royal hands presents this box
unseal it good armostes therein lie the secrets of the oracle out with it takes out the scroll
apollo live our patron
the plot in which the vine takes root begins to dry from head to foot the stock soon withering want of sap doth cause to quail the budding grape but from the neighbouring elm a dew	 shall drop and feed the plot anew
that is the oracle what exposition makes the philosopher
this brief one only
the plot is sparta the dri'd vine the king the quailing grape his daughter but the thing	 of most importance not to be reveal'd is a near prince the elm the rest conceal'd
enough although the opening of this riddle be but itself a riddle yet we construe how near our labouring age draws to a rest
but must calantha quail too
that young grape untimely budded
i could mourn for her her tenderness hath yet deserve'd no rigour so to be crost by fate
you misapply sir with favour let me speak it what apollo	 hath clouded in hid sense
i here conjecture her marriage with some neighb'ring prince the dew of which befriending elm shall ever strengthen your subjects with a sovereignty of power
besides most gracious lord the pith of oracles	 is to be then digested when th' events expound their truth not brought as soon to light as utter'd
truth is child of time and herein i find no scruple rather cause of comfort with unity of kingdoms
may it prove so	 for weal of this dear nation
armostes crotolon when this wither'd vine of my frail carcass on the funeral pile is fir'd into its ashes let that young man be hedg'd about still with your cares and loves
much owe i to his worth much to his service
let such as wait come in now
o my royal master
cleave not my heart sweet twins of my life's solace with your forejudging fears there is no physic	 so cunningly restorative to cherish the fall of age or call back youth and vigour as your consents in duty
i will shake off this languishing disease of time to quicken fresh pleasures in these drooping hours of sadness
is fair euphranea married yet to prophilus
this morning gracious lord
this very morning which with your highness' leave you may ob serve too
our sister looks methinks mirthful and sprightly as if her chaster fancy could already	 expound the riddle of her gain in losing a trifle maids know only that they know not
prithee blush not 'tis but honest change of fashion in the garment loose for strait and so the modest maid is made a wife
shrewd business is 't not sister
we thank thee orgilus this mirth be comes thee
but wherefore sits the court in such a silence
a wedding without revels is not seemly
your late indisposition sir forbade it
be it thy charge calantha to set forward the bridal sports to which i will be present if not at least consenting
mine own ithocles i have done little for thee yet
have built me to the full height i stand in
may i propose a suit
demand and have it
pray sir give me this young man and no further account him yours than he deserves in all things to be thought worth mine i will esteem him according to his merit
still thou 'rt my daughter	 still grow'st upon my heart
to give me thine hand calantha take thine own in noble actions thou 'lt find him firm and absolute
i would not have parted with thee ithocles to any but to a mistress who is all what i am
a change great king most wisht for 'cause the same
aside to th' art mine
have i now kept my word
rich fortunes guard the favour of a princess rock thee brave man in ever crowned plenty
are minion of the time be thankful for it
here 's a swing in destiny ap parent
the youth is up on tiptoe yet may stumble
on to your recreations
now convey me unto my bed chamber none on his forehead wear a distempered look
the gods preserve ye
aside to sweet be not from my sight
aside to my whole felicity
exeunt carrying out the king
shall i be bold my lord
thou canst not orgilus
call me thine own for prophilus must hence forth be all thy sister's friendship though it cease not	 in marriage yet is oft at less command than when a single freedom can dispose it
most right my most good lord my most great lord my gracious princely lord i might add royal
why not pray sir
the sovereignty of kingdoms in their nonage stoop'd to desert not birth there 's as much merit in clearness of affection as in puddle of generation you have conquer'd love even in the loveliest if i greatly err not	 the son of venus hath bequeath'd his quiver to ithocles his manage by whose arrows calantha's breast is open'd
i was myself a piece of suitor once and forward in preferment too so forward	 that speaking truth i may without offence sir presume to whisper that my hopes and hark ye my certainty of marriage stood assured with as firm footing by your leave as any's now at this very instant but ith
is granted	 and for a league of privacy between us read o'er my bosom and partake a secret the princess is contracted mine
i now applaud her wisdom when your king dom stands seated in your will secure and settled	 i dare pronounce you will be a just monarch greece must admire and tremble
then the sweetness of so imparadis'd a comfort orgilus
it is to banquet with the gods
the glory of numerous children potency of nobles	 bent knees hearts pav'd to tread on
with a friendship so dear so fast as thine
i am unfitting for office but for service ith
we 'll distinguish our fortunes merely in the title partners in all respects else but the bed

till lastly we slip down in the common earth together and there our beds are equal save some mon ument to show this was the king and this the sub ject
list what sad sounds are these extremely sad ones
sure from penthea's lodgings
o no more no more too late sighs are spent the burning tapers of a life as chaste as fate pure as are unwritten papers are burnt out no heat no light now remains 't is ever night
love is dead let lovers' eyes lock'd in endless dreams th' extremes of all extremes	 ope no more for now love dies now love dies implying love's martyrs must be ever ever dying
o my misgiving heart
a horrid stillness succeeds this deathful air let 's know tho rea son	 tread softly there is mystery in mourning
enter and bringing in in a chair veiled two other servants placing two chairs one on the one side and the other with an engine on the other
the maids sit down at her feet mourning
the servants go out meet them and ser
aside to is done that on her right hand
soft peace enrich this room
how fares the lady
tell us how parted she from life
she call'd for music and begg'd some gentle voice to tune a fare well	 to life and griefs christalla touch'd the lute i wept the funeral song
which scarce was ended but her last breath seal'd up these hollow sounds cruel ithocles and injur'd orgilus
" so down she drew her veil so died
you are messengers of death go from us here 's woe enough to court without a prompter away and hark ye till you see us next no syllable that she is dead
away keep a smooth brow
exeunt and my lord ith
another is not left me
take that chair i 'll seat me here in this between us sits the object of our sorrows some few tears we 'll part among us i perhaps can mix one lamentable story to prepare 'em
there there sit there my lord
yes as you please
sits down and is catcht in the engine
what means this treachery
you are caught young master 't is thy throne of coronation thou fool of greatness
see i take this veil off survey a beauty wither'd by the flames	 of an insulting phaëton her brother
thou mean'st to kill me basely
i foreknew the last act of her life and train'd thee hither to sacrifice a tyrant to a turtle
you dreamt of kingdoms did ye
how to bosom	 the delicacies of a youngling princess how with this nod to grace that subtle courtier how with that frown to make this noble trem ble and so forth whiles penthea's groans and tor tures her agonies her miseries afflictions	 ne'er toucht upon your thought as for my in juries alas they were beneath your royal pity but yet they liv'd thou proud man to con found thee
behold thy fate this steel
a courage as keen as thy revenge shall give it welcome but prithee faint not if the wound close up	 tent it with double force and search it deeply
thou look'st that i should whine and beg com passion as loth to leave the vainness of my glories
a statelier resolution arms my confidence	 to cozen thee of honour neither could i with equal trial of unequal fortune by hazard of a duel 't were a bravery too mighty for a slave intending murder
on to the execution and inherit	 a conflict with thy horrors
by apollo thou talk'st a goodly language
for requital i will report thee to thy mistress richly
and take this peace along some few short minutes determin'd my resolves shall quickly follow	 thy wrathful ghost then if we tug for mas tery penthea's sacred eyes shall lend new courage
give me thy hand be healthful in thy part ing from lost mortality
thus thus i free it
yet yet i scorn to shrink
keep up thy spirit	 i will be gentle even in blood to linger pain which i strive to cure were to be cruel
nimble in vengeance i forgive thee
follow safety with best success o may it prosper
penthea by thy side thy brother bleeds	 the earnest of his wrongs to thy forc'd faith
thoughts of ambition or delicious banquet with beauty youth and love together perish in my last breath which on the sacred altar of a long look'd for peace now moves to heaven
farewell fair spring of manhood
henceforth welcome best expectation of a noble suff'rance
i 'll lock the bodies safe till what must fol low shall be approv'd
sweet twins shine stars for ever
in vain they build their hopes whose life is shame	 no monument lasts but a happy name
athens to athens i have sent the nursery of greece for learning and the fount of know ledge for here in sparta there 's not left amongst us one wise man to direct we 're all turn'd mad caps
is said apollo is the god of herbs	 then certainly he knows the virtue of 'em to delphos i have sent too
if there can be a help for nature we are sure yet
honour attend thy counsels ever
i beseech thee with all my heart let me go from thee quietly i will not aught to do with thee of all men
the doubles of a hare or in a morning salutes from a splay footed witch to drop three drops of blood at th' nose just and no more croaking of ravens or the screech of owls	 are not so boding mischief as thy crossing my private meditations
shun me prithee and if i cannot love thee heartily i'll love thee as well as i can
noble bassanes mistake me not
then we shall be troubled
thou wert ordain'd my plague heaven make me thankful and give me patience too heaven i beseech thee
accept a league of amity for hence forth i vow by my best genius in a syllable never to speak vexation
i will study	 service and friendship with a zealous sorrow for my past incivility towards ye
hey day good words good words
i must believe 'em and be a coxcomb for my labour
use not so hard a language your misdoubt is cause less
for instance if you promise to put on a constancy of patience such a patience as chronicle or history ne'er mentioned as follows not example but shall stand a wonder and a theme for imitation	 the first the index pointing to a second i will acquaint ye with an unmatch'd secret whose knowledge to your griefs shall set a pe riod
thou canst not orgilus 't is in the power of the gods only yet for satisfaction	 because i note an earnest in thine utterance unforc'd and naturally free be resolute the virgin bays shall not withstand the light ning with a more careless danger than my constancy the full of thy relation
could it move	 distraction in a senseless marble statue it should find me a rock i do expect now some truth of unheard moment
to your patience you must add privacy as strong in silence as mysteries lock'd up in jove's own bosom
a skull hid in the earth a treble age shall sooner prate
lastly to such direction as the severity of a glorious action deserves to lead your wisdom and your judg ment you ought to yield obedience
with assurance	 of will and thankfulness
with manly courage please then to follow me
where'er i fear not
enter and leading and leading sup porting and cease loud music all make a stand
we miss our servant ithocles and orgilus on whom attend they
my son gracious princess whisper'd some new device to which these revels should be but usher wherein i conceive lord ithocles and himself are actors
a fair excuse for absence as for bass anes delights to him are troublesome armostes is with the king
on to the dance
dear cousin hand you the bride the bride groom must be intrusted to my courtship be not jealous	 euphranea i shall scarcely prove a tempt ress
fall to our dance
dances with with with with they dance the first change during which enters
the king your father's dead
to the other change
penthea poor penthea's starved
lead to the next
amazement dulls my senses
whispers brave ithocles is murder'd murder'd cruelly
how dull this music sounds
strike up more sprightly our footings are not active like our heart which treads the nimbler measure
let us breathe awhile
hath not this motion	 rais'd fresher colour on your cheeks
sweet princess a perfect purity of blood enamels the beauty of your white
we all look cheerfully and cousin 't is methinks a rare presumption in any who prefer our lawful pleasures	 before their own sour censure t' interrupt the custom of this ceremony bluntly
yes yes some hollow voice deliver'd to me how that the king was dead
the king is dead	 that fatal news was mine for in mine arms he breath'd his last and with his crown be queath'd ye your mother's wedding ring which here i ten der
peace crown his ashes
we are queen then
long live the queen
that my penthea miserable soul was starv'd to death
she's happy she hath finish'd a long and painful progress
a third mur mur pierc'd mine unwilling ears
that ithocles	 was murder'd rather butcher'd had not bravery of an undaunted spirit conquering terror proclaim'd his last act triumph over ruin
by mine this weapon	 was instrument to my revenge the reasons are just and known quit him of these and then never liv'd gentleman of greater merit hope or abiliment to steer a kingdom
you have done it
how it was done let him report the forfeit of whose allegiance to our laws doth covet rigour of justice but that done it is mine eyes have been an evidence of credit too sure to be convinc'd
armostes rent not thine arteries with hearing the bare circum stances	 of these calamities thou 'st lost a nephew a niece and i a wife continue man still make me the pattern of digesting evils who can outlive my mighty ones not shrink ing	 at such a pressure as would sink a soul into what's most of death the worst of hor rors
but i have seal'd a covenant with sadness and enter'd into bonds without condition to stand these tempests calmly mark me nobles	 i do not shed a tear not for penthea
we begin our reign with a first act of justice thy confession unhappy orgilus dooms thee a sentence but yet thy father's or thy sister's presence	 shall be excus'd
give crotolon a blessing to thy lost son euphranea take a fare well and both be gone
to confirm thee noble sor row in worthy resolution
could my tears speak my griefs were slight
all goodness dwell amongst ye
enjoy my sister prophilus my vengeance aim'd never at thy prejudice
exeunt and bloody relater of thy stains in blood for that thou hast reported him whose for tunes and life by thee are both at once snatch'd from him	 with honourable mention make thy choice of what death likes thee best there's all our bounty
but to excuse delays let me dear cousin intreat you and these lords see execution instant before ye part
your will commands us
one suit just queen my last vouch safe your clemency that by no common hand i be divided from this my humble frailty
to their wisdoms who are to be spectators of thine end i make the reference
those that are dead	 are dead had they not now died of necessity they must have paid the debt they ow'd to nature one time or other
use dispatch my lords we'll suddenly prepare our coronation
is strange these tragedies should never touch on	 her female pity
she has a masculine spirit and wherefore should i pule and like a girl put finger in the eye
let's be all toughness without distinction betwixt sex and sex
now orgilus thy choice
to bleed to death
myself no surgeon i am well skill'd in letting blood
bind fast this arm that so the pipes may from their con duits convey a full stream here's a skilful instru ment
only i am a beggar to some charity	 to speed me in this execution by lending th' other prick to th' tother arm when this is bubbling life out
i am for ye it most concerns my art my care my credit
quick fillet both his arms
such courtesies are real which flow cheerfully without an expectation of requital
reach me a staff in this hand
they give him a staff
if a proneness or custom in my nature from my cradle had been inclin'd to fierce and eager blood shed	 a coward guilt hid in a coward quaking would have betray'd fame to ignoble flight and vagabond pursuit of dreadful safety but look upon my steadiness and scorn not the sickness of my fortune which since bass anes	 was husband to penthea had lain bed rid
we trifle time in words thus i show cunning in opening of a vein too full too lively
pierces the vein with his dagger
i tremble at the sight
would i were loose
it sparkles like a lusty wine new broacht the vessel must be sound from which it is sues
grasp hard this other stick i'll be as nim ble but prithee look not pale have at ye
stretch out thine arm with vigour and with unshook vir tue
o i envy not a rival fitted	 to conquer in extremities
this pastime appears majestical some high tun'd poem hereafter shall deliver to posterity the writer's glory and his subject's triumph
how is 't man
i feel no palsies
on a pair royal do i wait in death my sovereign as his liegeman on my mistress as a devoted servant and on ithocles as if no brave yet no unworthy enemy
nor did i use an engine to entrap his life out of a slavish fear to combat youth strength or cunning but for that i durst not engage the goodness of a cause on fortune by which his name might have outfac'd my vengeance
o tecnicus inspir'd with phoebus' fire
i call to mind thy augury 't was perfect revenge proves its own executioner
when feeble man is bending to his mother the dust 'a was first fram'd on thus he totters
life's fountain is dri'd up
so falls the standard	 of my prerogative in being a creature
a mist hangs o'er mine eyes the sun's bright splendour is clouded in an everlasting shadow welcome thou ice that sitt'st about my heart no heat can ever thaw thee
speech hath left him
has shook hands with time his funeral urn shall be my charge remove the bloodless body
the coronation must require attendance that past my few days can be but one mourn ing
an altar covered with white two lights of virgin wax during which music of recorders enter four bearing on a hearse or in a chair in a rich robe with a crown on his head place him on one side of the altar
after him enter in a white robe and crown'd and in white and goes and kneels before the altar the rest stand off the women kneeling behind the recorders cease during her devotions
and the rest rise doing obei sance to the altar
our orisons are heard the gods are merciful
now tell me you whose loyalties pay tribute to us your lawful sovereign how unskilful your duties or obedience is to render subjection to the sceptre of a virgin	 who have been ever fortunate in princes of masculine and stirring composition
a woman has enough to govern wisely
her own demeanours passions and divisions
a nation warlike and inur'd to practice	 of policy and labour cannot brook a feminate authority we therefore command your counsel how you may advise us in choosing of a husband whose abilities can better guide this kingdom
royal lady	 your law is in your will
we have seen tokens of constancy too lately to mistrust it
yet if your highness settle on a choice by your own judgment both allow'd and lik'd of sparta may grow in power and proceed	 to an increasing height
hold you the same mind
alas great mistress reason is so clouded with the thick darkness of my infinite woes that i forecast nor dangers hopes or safety
give me some corner of the world to wear out	 the remnant of the minutes i must number where i may hear no sounds but sad com plaints of virgins who have lost contracting partners of husbands howling that their wives were ravisht by some untimely fate of friends divided	 by churlish opposition or of fathers weeping upon their children's slaughtered car cases or daughters groaning o'er their fathers' hearses and i can dwell there and with these keep consort as musical as theirs
what can you look for	 from an old foolish peevish doting man but craziness of age
cousin of argos near
were i presently to choose you for my lord i'll open freely what articles i would propose to treat on	 before our marriage
name them virtuous lady
i would presume you would retain the royalty of sparta in her own bounds then in argos armostes might be viceroy in messene might crotolon bear sway and bassanes 	 bass
the multitudes of high employments could not but set a peace to private griefs
these gentle men groneas and hemophil with worthy pensions should wait upon your person in your cham ber
i would bestow christalla on amelus
she'll prove a constant wife and philema should into vesta's temple
this is a testament
it sounds not like conditions on a marriage
all this should be perform'd
lastly for prophilus	 he should be cousin solemnly invested in all those honours titles and preferments which his dear friend and my neglected hus band too short a time enjoy'd
i am unworthy to live in your remembrance
madam what means that word "neg lected husband"
forgive me now i turn to thee thou shadow of my contracted lord
bear witness all i put my mother's wedding ring upon his finger 't was my father's last bequest
places a ring on the finger of thus i new marry him whose wife i am death shall not separate us
o my lords i but deceiv'd your eyes with antic gesture when one news straight came huddling on another of death
still i danced forward	 but it struck home and here and in an in stant
be such mere women who with shrieks and outcries can vow a present end to all their sorrows yet live to court new pleasures and outlive them
they are the silent griefs which cut the heart strings	 let me die smiling
is a truth too ominous
one kiss on these cold lips my last
argos now 's sparta's king
command the voices which wait at th' altar now to sing the song i fitted for my end
glories pleasures pomps delights and ease can but please outward senses when the mind is or untroubled or by peace refin'd
crowns may flourish and decay	 beauties shine but fade away
youth may revel yet it must lie down in a bed of dust
earthly honours flow and waste time alone doth change and last
sorrows mingled with contents prepare rest for care love only reigns in death though art can find no comfort for a broken heart
look to the queen
her heart is broke indeed
o royal maid would thou hadst mist this part
yet 't was a brave one
i must weep to see her smile in death
thus said he when youth is ripe and age from time doth part the lifeless trunk shall wed the broken heart is here fulfill'd
i am your king
long live	 nearchus king of sparta
her last will shall never be digrest from wait in order upon these faithful lovers as becomes us
the counsels of the gods are never known	 till men can call th' effects of them their own
noble judgments and clear eyes are fix'd to grace endeavour there sits truth not mix'd with ignorance those censures may command belief which talk not till they understand
let some say "this was flat" some "here the scene	 fell from its height" another that the mean was "ill observ'd" in such a growing passion as it transcended either state or fashion some few may cry was pretty well" or so "but " and there shrug in silence yet we know	 our writer's aim was in the whole addrest well to deserve of all but please the best which granted by th' allowance of this strain the may be piec'd up again
