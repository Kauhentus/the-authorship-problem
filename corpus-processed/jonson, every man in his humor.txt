though need make many poets and some such as art and nature have not better'd much yet ours for want hath not so loved the stage as he dare serve the ill customs of the age or purchase your delight at such a rate as for it he himself must justly hate to make a child now swaddled to proceed man and then shoot up in one beard and weed past threescore years or with three rusty swords and help of some few foot and half foot words fight over york and lancaster's king jars and in the tyring house bring wounds to scars
he rather prays you will be pleas'd to see one such to day as other plays should be where neither chorus wafts you o'er the seas nor creaking throne comes down the boys to please nor nimble squib is seen to make afeard the gentlewomen nor roll'd bullet heard to say it thunders nor tempestuous drum rumbles to tell you when the storm doth come but deeds and language such as men do use and persons such as comedy would choose when she would shew an image of the times and sport with human follies not with crimes
except we make them such by loving still our popular errors when we know they're ill
i mean such errors as you'll all confess by laughing at them they deserve no less which when you heartily do there's hope left then you that have so grac'd monsters may like men
enter at the door of his house
a goodly day toward and a fresh morning
call up your young master bid him rise sir
tell him i have some business to employ him
i will sir presently
but hear you sirrah if he be at his book disturb him not
how happy yet should i esteem myself could i by any practice wean the boy from one vain course of study he affects
he is a scholar if a man may trust the liberal voice of fame in her report of good account in both our universities either of which hath favoured him with graces but their indulgence must not spring in me a fond opinion that he cannot err
myself was once a student and indeed fed with the self same humour he is now dreaming on nought but idle poetry that fruitless and unprofitable art good unto none but least to the professors which then i thought the mistress of all knowledge but since time and the truth have waked my judgment
and reason taught me better to distinguish t he vain from the useful learnings
enter master cousin stephen what news with you that you are here so early
nothing but e'en come to see how you do unclo
that's kindly done you are welcome coz
ay i know that sir i would not have come else
how does my cousin edward uncle
o well coz go in and see i doubt he be scarce stirring yet
uncle afore i go in can you tell me an he have e'er a book of the science of hawking and hunting i would fain borrow it
why i hope you will not a hawking now will you
no wusse but i'll practise against next year uncle
i have bought me a hawk and a hood and bells and all i lack nothing but a book to keep it by
nay look you now you are angry uncle why you know an a man have not skill in the hawking and hunting languages now a days i'll not give a rush for him they are more studied than the greek or the latin
he is for no gallant's company without them and by gadslid i scorn it i so i do to be a consort for every humdrum hang them scroyles
there's nothing in them i' the world
what do you talk on it
because i dwell at hogsden i shall keep company with none but the archers of finsbury or the citizens that come a ducking to islington ponds
a fine jest i' faith
'slid a gentleman mun shew himself like a gentleman
uncle i pray you be not angry i know what i have to do i trow
i am no novice
you are a prodigal absurd coxcomb go to
nay never look at me 'tis i that speak take't as you will sir i'll not flatter you
have you not yet found means enow to waste that which your friends have left you but you must go cast away your money on a buzzard and know not how to keep it when you have done
o it is comely
this will make you a gentleman
well cousin well i see you are e'en past hope of all reclaim ay so now you are told on't you look another way
what would you ha' me do
what would i have you do
i'll tell you kinsman learn to be wise and practise how to thrive that would i have you do and not to spend your coin on every bauble that you fancy or every foolish brain that humours you
i would not have you to invade each place nor thrust yourself on all societies till men's affections or your own desert should worthily invite you to your rank
he that is so respectless in his courses oft sells his reputation at cheap market
nor would i you should melt away yourself in flashing bravery lest while you affect to make a blaze of gentry to the world a little puff of scorn extinguish it and you be left like an unsavoury snuff whose property is only to offend
i'd have you sober and contain yourself not that your sail be bigger than your boat but moderate your expenses now at first as you may keep the same proportion still nor stand so much on your gentility which is an airy and mere borrow'd thing from dead men's dust and bones and none of yours except you make or hold it
nay we do not stand much on our gentility friend yet you are welcome and i assure you mine uncle here is a man of a thousand a year middlesex land
he has but one son in all the world i am his next heir at the common law master stephen as simple as i stand here if my cousin die as there's hope he will i have a pretty living mine own too beside hard by here
in good time sir
in good time sir
why and in very good time sir
you do not flout friend do you
servo not i sir
you were best not sir an you should here be them can perceive it and that quickly too go to and they can give it again soundly too an need be
servo why sir let this satisfy you good faith i had no such intent
sir an i thought you had i would talk with you and that presently
good master stephen so you may sir at your pleasure
and so i would sir good my saucy companion
an you were out mine uncle's ground i can tell you though i do not stand upon my gentility neither in't
cousin cousin will this ne'er be left
a mechanical serving man
by this cudgel an 'twere not for shame i would know
what would you do you peremptory gull
if you cannot be quiet get you hence
you see the honest man demeans himself modestly tow'rds you giving no reply to your unseason'd quarrelling rude fashion and still you huff it with a kind of carriage as void of wit as of humanity
go get you in 'fore heaven i am ashamed thou hast a kinsman's interest in me
i pray sir is this master knowell's house
yes marry is it sir
i should inquire for a gentleman here one master edward knowell do you know any such sir i pray you
i should forget myself else sir
are you the gentleman
cry you mercy sir i was required by a gentleman in the city as i rode out at this end the town to deliver you this letter sir
what do you mean
pray you remember your court'sy
to his most selected friend master edward knowell
what might the gentleman's name be sir that sent it
nay pray you be covered
one master wellbred sir
a young gentleman is he not
the same sir master kitely married his sister the rich merchant in the old jewry
you say very true
make this honest friend drink here pray you go in
exeunt brainworm and servant
this letter is directed to my son yet i am edward knowell too and may with the safe conscience of good manners use the fellow's error to my satisfaction
well i will break it ope old men are curious be it but for the style's sake and the phrase to see if both do answer my son's praises who is almost grown the idolater of this young wellbred
what have we here
reads why ned i beseech thee hast thou forsworn all thy friends in the old jewry
or dost thou think us all jews that inhabit there
yet if thou dost come over and but see our frippery change an old shirt for a whole smock with us do not conceive that antipathy between us and hogsden as was between jews and hogs flesh
leave thy vigilant father alone to number over his green apricots evening and morning on the north west wall an i had been his son i had saved him the labour long since if taking in all the young wenches that pass by at the back door and codling every kernel of the fruit for them would have served but pr'ythee come over to me quickly this morning i have such a present for thee
our turkey company never sent the like to the grand signior
one is a rhymer sir of your own batch your own leaven but doth think himself poet major of the town willing to be shewn and worthy to be seen
the other i will not venture his description with you till you come because i would have you make hither with an appetite
if the worst of 'em be not worth your journey draw your bill of charges as unconscionable as any guildhall verdict will give it you and you shall be allowed your viaticum
from the bordello it might come as well the spittle or pict hatch
is this the man my son hath sung so for the happiest wit the choicest brain the times have sent us forth
i know not what he may be in the arts nor what in schools but surely for his manners i judge him a profane and dissolute wretch worse by possession of such great good gifts being the master of so loose a spirit
why what unhallowed ruffian would have writ in such a scurrilous manner to a friend
why should he think i tell my apricots or play the hesperian dragon with my fruit to watch it
well my son i had thought you had had more judgment to have made election of your companions than t' have ta'en on trust such petulant jeering gamesters that can spare no argument or subject from their jest
but i perceive affection makes a fool of any man too much the father
is the fellow gone that brought this letter
yea sir a pretty while since
and where is your young master
in his chamber sir
he spake not with the fellow did he
no sir he saw him not
take you this letter and deliver it my son but with no notice that i have opened it on your life
that were a jest indeed
i am resolved i will not stop his journey nor practise any violent means to stay the unbridled course of youth in him for that restrain'd grows more impatient and in kind like to the eager but the generous greyhound who ne'er so little from his game withheld turns head and leaps up at his holder's throat
there is a way of winning more by love and urging of tho modesty than fear force works on servile natures not the free
he that's compell'd to goodness may be good but 'tis but for that fit where others drawn by softness and example get a habit
then if they stray but warn them and the same they should for virtue have done they'll do for shame
a room in house
enter with a letter in his hand followed by know
did he open it say'st thou
yes my word sir and read the contents
that scarce contents me
what countenance prithee made he in the reading of it
was he angry or pleased
nay sir i saw him not read it nor open it i assure your worship
how know'st thou then that he did either
marry sir because he charged me on my life to tell nobody that he open'd it which unless he had done he would never fear to have it revealed
that's true well i thank thee brainworm
o brainworm didst thou not see a fellow here in what sha call him doublet
he brought mine uncle a letter e'en now
yes master stephen what of him
o i have such a mind to beat him where is he canst thou tell
faith he is not of that mind he is gone master stephen
he is rid hence he took horse at the street door
and i staid in the fields
o that i had but a horse to fetch him back again
why you may have my master's gelding to save your longing sir
but i have no boots that's the spite on't
why a fine wisp of hay roll'd hard master stephen
no faith it's no boot to follow him now let him e'en go and hang
prithee help to truss me a little he does so vex me brai
you'll be worse vexed when you are trussed master stephen
best keep unbraced and walk yourself till you be cold your choler may founder you else
by my faith and so i will now thou tell'st me on't how dost thou like my leg brainworm
a very good leg master stephen but the woollen stocking does not commend it so well
the stockings be good enough now summer is coming on for the dust i'll have a pair of silk against winter that i go to dwell in the town
i think my leg would shew in a silk hose brai
believe me master stephen rarely well
in sadness i think it would i have a reasonable good leg
you have an excellent good leg master stephen but i can not stay to praise it longer now and i am very sorry for it
another time will serve brainworm
'slid i hope he laughs not at me an he do know
here was a letter indeed to be intercepted by a man's father and do him good with him
he cannot but think most virtuously both of me and the sender sure that make the careful costermonger of him in our familiar epistles
well if he read this with patience i'll be gelt and troll ballads for master john trundle yonder the rest of my mortality
it is true and likely my father may have as much patience as another man for he takes much physic and oft taking physic makes a man very patient
but would your packet master wellbred had arrived at him in such a minute of his patience
then we had known the end of it which now is doubtful and threatens sees master stephen
what my wise cousin
nay then i'll furnish our feast with one gull more toward the mess
he writes to me of a brace and here's one that's three oh for a fourth fortune if ever thou' it use thine eyes i entreat thee step
oh now i see who he laughed at he laughed at somebody in that letter
by this good light an he had laughed at me know
how now cousin stephen melancholy
yes a little i thought you had laughed at me cousin
why what an i had coz
what would you have done
by this light i would have told mine uncle
nay if you would have told your uncle i did laugh at you coz
i am satisfied it is sufficient
why be so gentle coz and i pray you let me entreat a courtesy of you
i am sent for this morning by a friend in the old jewry to come to him it is but crossing over the fields to moorgate will you bear me company
i protest it is not to draw you into bond or any plot against the state coz
sir that's all one an it were you shall command me twice so far as moorgate to do you good in such a matter
do you think i would leave you
no no you shall not protest coz
by my fackings but i will by your leave i'll protest more to my friend than i'll speak of at this time
you speak very well coz
nay not so neither you shall pardon me but i speak to serve my turn
do you know what you say
a gentleman of your sorts parts carriage and estimation to talk of your turn in this company and to me alone like a tankard bearer at a conduit
a wight that hitherto his every step hath left the stamp of a great foot behind him as every word the savour of a strong spirit and he
so graced gilded or to use a more fit metaphor so tenfold by nature as not ten housewives' pewter again a good time shews more bright to the world than he
as i said last so i say again and still shall say it this man
to conceal such real ornaments as these and shadow their glory as a milliner's wife does her wrought stomacher with a smoaky lawn or a black cyprus
it cannot be answered go not about it drake's old ship at deptford may sooner circle the world again
come wrong not the quality of your desert with looking downward coz but hold up your head so and let the idea of what you are be portrayed in your face that men may read in your physnomy here within this place is to be seen the true rare and accomplished monster or miracle of nature which is all one
what think you of this coz
why i do think of it and i will be more proud and melancholy and gentlemanlike than i have been i'll insure you
why that's resolute master stephen
now if i can but hold him up to his height as it is happily begun it will do well for a suburb humour we may hap have a match with the city and play him for forty pound
you must go before
nay an i must i will
pray you shew me good cousin
the lane before cob's house
i think this be the house what ho
give your worship good morrow
how dost thou good cob
dost thou inhabit here cob
ay sir i and my lineage have kept a poor house here in our days
thy lineage monsieur cob
what lineage what lineage
why sir an ancient lineage and a princely
mine ance'try came from a king's belly no worse man and yet no man either by your worship's leave i did lie in that but herring the king of fish from his belly i proceed one of the monarchs of the world i assure you
the first red herring that was broiled in adam and eve's kitchen do i fetch my pedigree from by the harrot's book
his cob was my great great mighty great grandfather
why mighty why mighty i pray thee
o it was a mighty while ago sir and a mighty great cob
how know'st thou that
how know why i smell his ghost ever and anon
and the ghost of a herring cob
ay sir with favour of your worship's nose master mathew why not the ghost of a herring cob as well as the ghost of rasher bacon
roger bacon thou would'st say
i say rasher bacon
they were both broiled on the coals and a man may smell broiled meat i hope
you are a scholar upsolve me that now
cob canst thou shew me of a gentleman one captain bobadill where his lodging is
o my guest sir you mean
alas ha ha ha
why do you laugh sir
do you not mean captain bobadill
cob pray thee advise thyself well do not wrong the gentleman and thyself too
i dare be sworn he scorns thy house he
he lodge in such a base obscure place as thy house
tut i know his disposition so well he would not lie in thy bed if thou'dst give it him
i will not give it him though sir
mass i thought somewhat was in it we could not get him to bed all night well sir though he lie not on my bed he lies on my bench an't please you to go up sir you shall find him with two cushions under his head and his cloak wrapped about him as though he had neither won nor lost and yet i warrant he ne'er cast better in his life than he has done to night
why was he drunk
you hear not me say so perhaps he swallowed a tavern token or some such device sir i have nothing to do withal
i deal with water and not with wine give me my tankard there ho
god be wi' you sir
it's six o'clock i should have carried two turns by this
enter tib with a water tankard
lie in a water bearer's house
a gentleman of his havings
well i'll tell him my mind
what tib shew this gentleman up to the captain
exit tib with master mathew
oh an my house were the brazen head now
faith it would e'en speak moe fools yet
you should have some now would take this master mathew to be a gentleman at the least
his father's an honest man a worshipful fishmonger and so forth and now does he creep and wriggle into acquaintance with all the brave gallants about the town such as my guest is o my guest is a fine man
and they flout him invincibly
he useth every day to a merchant's house where i serve water one master kitely's in the old jewry and here's the jest he is in love with my master's sister mrs
bridget and calls her mistress and there he will sit you a whole afternoon sometimes reading of these same abominable vile a pox on 'em
i cannot abide them rascally verses poetrie poetrie and speaking of interludes 'twill make a man burst to hear him
and the wenches they do so jeer and ti he at him well should they do so much to me i'd forswear them all by the foot of pharaoh
how many water bearers shall you hear swear such an oath
o i have a guest he teaches me he does swear the legiblest of any man christened by st
the foot of pharaoh
the body of me
as i am a gentleman and a soldier
and withal he does take this same filthy roguish tobacco the finest and cleanliest
it would do a man good to see the fumes come forth at's tonnels
well he owes me forty shillings my wife lent him out of her purse by sixpence at a time besides his lodging i would i had it
i shall have it he says the next action
helterskelter hang sorrow care'll kill a cat up tails all and a louse for the hangman
a room in house
discoved lying on a bench
what say you sir
a cup of thy small beer sweet hostess
sir there's a gentleman below would speak with you
'odso i am not within
my husband told him you were sir
what a plague what meant he
take away the bason good hostess come up sir
he would desire you to come up cleanly house here
save you sir save you captain
is it you sir
thank you good captain you may see i am somewhat audacious
i was requested to supper last night by a sort of gallants where you were wished for and drunk to i assure you
vouchsafe me by whom good captain
marry by young wellbred and others
why hostess stool here for this gentleman
no haste sir 'tis very well
it was so late ere we parted last night i can scarce open my eyes yet i was but new risen as you came how passes the day abroad sir
faith some half hour to seven now trust me you have an exceeding fine lodging here very neat and private
ay sir sit down i pray you
master mathew in any case possess no gentlemen of our acquaintance with notice of my lodging
not that i need to care who know it for the cabin is convenient but in regard i would not be too popular and generally visited as some are
true captain i conceive you
for do you see sir by the heart of valour in me except it be to some peculiar and choice spirits to whom i am extraordinarily engaged as yourself or so i could not extend thus far
i confess i love a cleanly and quiet privacy above all the tumult and roar of fortune
what new book have you there
ay did you ever see it acted
is't not well penned
while master mathew reads bobadill makes himself ready
i would fain see all the poets of these times pen such another play as that was they'll prate and swagger and keep a stir of art and devices when as i am a gentleman read 'em they are the most shallow pitiful barren fellows that live upon the face of the earth again
indeed here are a number of fine speeches in this book
o eyes no eyes but fountains fraught with tears
fountains fraught with tears
o life no life but lively form of death
o world no world but mass of public wrongs
confused and fill'd with murder and misdeeds
is't not simply the best that ever you heard captain
how do you like it
to thee the purest object to my sense the most refined essence heaven covers send i these lines wherein i do commence the happy state of turtle billing lovers
if they prove rough unpolish'd harsh and rude haste made the waste thus mildly i conclude
a toy of mine own in my non age the infancy of my muses
but when will you come and see my study
good faith i can shew you some very good things i have done of late
that boot becomes your leg passing well captain methinks
so so it's the fashion gentlemen now use
troth captain and now you speak of the fashion master wellbred's elder brother and i are fallen out exceedingly this other day i happened to enter into some discourse of a hanger which i assure you both for fashion and workmanship was most peremptory beautiful and gentlemanlike yet he condemned and cried it down for the most pied and ridiculous that ever he saw
squire downright the half brother was't not
why he has no more judgment than a malt horse by st
george i wonder you'd lose a thought upon such an animal the most peremptory absurd clown of christendom this day he is holden
i protest to you as i am a gentleman and a soldier i ne'er changed with his like
by his discourse he should eat nothing but hay he was born for the manger pannier or pack saddle
he has not so much as a good phrase in his belly but all old iron and rusty proverbs a good commodity for some smith to make hob nails of
ay and he thinks to carry it away with his manhood still where he comes he brags he will give me the bastinado as i hear
how came he by that word trow
nay indeed he said cudgel me i termed it so for my more grace
that may be for i was sure it was none of his word but when when said he so
faith yesterday they say a young gallant a friend of mine told me so
by the foot of pharaoh an 'twere my case now i should send him a chartel presently
a most proper and sufficient dependence warranted by the great caranza
come hither you shall chartel him i'll shew you a trick or two you shall kill him with at pleasure the first stoccata if you will by this air
indeed you have absolute knowledge in the mystery i have heard sir
of whom of whom have you heard it i beseech you
troth i have heard it spoken of divers that you have very rare and un in one breath utterable skill sir
by heaven no not i no skill in the earth some small rudiments in the science as to know my time distance or so
i have professed it more for noblemen and gentlemen's use than mine own practice i assure you
hostess accommodate us with another bed staff here quickly
lend us another bed staff the woman does not understand the words of action
look you sir exalt not your point above this state at any hand and let your poniard maintain your defence thus give it the gentleman and leave us
come on o twine your body more about that you may fall to a more sweet comely gentlemanlike guard so
indifferent hollow your body more sir thus now stand fast your left leg note your distance keep your due proportion of time oh you disorder your point most i rregularly
how is the bearing of it now sir
o out of measure ill a well experienced hand would pass upon you at pleasure
how mean you sir pass upon me
why thus sir make a thrust at me master mathew pushes at bobadill come in upon the answer control your point and make a full career at the body the best practised gallants of the time name it the passado a most desperate thrust believe it
why you do not manage your weapon with any facility or grace to invite me
i have no spirit to play with you your dearth of judgment renders you tedious
but one venue sir
fie the most gross denomination as ever i heard o the stoccata while you live sir note that
come put on your cloke and we'll go to some private place where you are acquainted some tavern or so and have a bit
i'll send for one of these fencers and he shall breathe you by my direction and then i will teach you your trick you shall kill him with it at the first if you please
why i will learn you by the true judgment of the eye hand and foot to control any enemy's point in the world
should your adversary confront you with a pistol 'twere nothing by this hand
you should by the same rule control his bullet in a line except it were hail shot and spread
what money have you about you master mathew
faith i have not past a two shilling or so
'tis somewhat with the least but come we will have a bunch of radish and salt to taste our wine and a pipe of tobacco to close the orifice of the stomach and then we'll call upon young wellbred perhaps we shall meet the corydon his brother there and put him to the question
a hall in house
there lies a note within upon my desk here take my key it is no matter neither
where is the boy
within sir in the warehouse
let him tell over straight that spanish gold and weigh it with the pieces of eight
do you see the delivery of those silver stuffs to master lucar tell him if he will he shall have the grograns at the rate i told him and will meet him on the exchange anon
do you see that fellow brother downright
ay what of him
he is a jewel brother
i took him of a child up at my door and christen'd him gave him mine own name thomas since bred him at the hospital where proving a toward imp i call'd him home and taught him so much as i have made him my cashier and giv'n him who had none a surname cash and find him in his place so full of faith that i durst trust my life into his hands
so would not i in any bastard's brother as it is like he is although i knew myself his father
but you said you had somewhat to tell me gentle brother what is't what is't
faith i am very loath to utter it as fearing it may hurt your patience but that i know your judgment is of strength against the nearness of affection dow
what need this circumstance
pray you be direct
i will not say how much i do ascribe unto your friendship nor in what regard i hold your love but let my past behaviour and usage of your sister both confirm how well i have been affected to your dow
you are too tedious come to the matter the matter
then without further ceremony thus
my brother wellbred sir i know not how of late is much declined in what he was and greatly alter'd in his disposition
when he came first to lodge here in my house ne'er trust me if i were not proud of him methought he bare himself in such a fashion so full of man and sweetness in his carriage and what was chief it shew'd not borrow'd in him but all he did became him as his own and seem'd as perfect proper and possest as breath with life or colour with the blood
but now his course is so irregular so loose affected and deprived of grace and he himself withal so far fallen off from that first place as scarce no note remains to tell men's judgments where he lately stood
he's grown a stranger to all due respect forgetful of his friends and not content to stale himself in all societies he makes my house here common as a mart a theatre a public receptacle for giddy humour and deceased riot and here as in a tavern or a stews he and his wild associates spend their hours in repetition of lascivious jests swear leap drink dance and revel night by night control my servants and indeed what not
'sdeins i know not what i should say to him in the whole world
he values me at a crack'd three farthings for aught i see
it will never out of the flesh that's bred in the bone
i have told him enough one would think if that would serve but counsel to him is as good as a shoulder of mutton to a sick horse
he knows what to trust to for george let him spend and spend and domineer till his heart ake an he think to be relieved by me when he is got into one your city pounds the counters he has the wrong sow by the ear i'faith and claps his dish at the wrong man's door i'll lay my hand on my halfpenny ere i part with it to fetch him out i'll assure him
nay good brother let it not trouble you thus
he mads me i could eat my very spur leathers for anger
but why are you so tame
why do you not speak to him and tell him how he disquiets your house
o there are divers reasons to dissuade me
but would yourself vouchsafe to travail in it though but with plain and easy circumstance it would both come much better to his sense and savour less of stomach or of passion
you are his elder brother and that title both gives and warrants your authority which by your presence seconded must breed a kind of duty in him and regard whereas if i should intimate the least it would but add contempt to his neglect heap worse on ill make up a pile of hatred that in the rearing would come tottering down and in the ruin bury all our love
nay more than this brother if i should speak he would be ready from his heat of humour and overflowing of the vapour in him to blow the ears of his familiars with the false breath of telling what disgraces and low disparagement's i had put upon him
whilst they sir to relieve him in the fable make their loose comments upon every word gesture or look i use mock me all over from my flat cap unto my shining shoes and out of their impetuous rioting phant'sies beget some slander that shall dwell with me
and what would that be think you
marry this they would give out because my wife is fair myself but lately married and my sister here sojourning a virgin in my house that i were jealous i nay as sure as death that they would say and how that i had quarrell'd my brother purposely thereby to find an apt pretext to banish them my house
mass perhaps so they're like enough to do it
brother they would believe it so should i like one of these penurious quack salvers but set the bills up to mine own disgrace and try experiments upon myself lend scorn and envy opportunity to stab my reputation and good name enter master struggling with mat
i will speak to him
by the foot of pharaoh you shall not
you shall not do him that grace
the time of day to you gentleman the house
is master wellbred stirring
what should he do
gentleman of the house it is to you is he within sir
he came not to his lodging to night sir i assure you
why do you hear
the gentleman citizen hath satisfied me i'll talk to no scavenger
stand you away an you love me
you shall not follow him now i pray you brother good faith you shall not i will overrule you
well go to i say little but by this good day god forgive me i should swear if i put it up so say i am the rankest cow that ever pist
'sdeins an i swallow this i'll ne'er draw my sword in the sight of fleet street again while i live i'll sit in a barn with madge howlet and catch mice first
and i'll go near to fill that huge tumbrel slop of yours with somewhat an i have good luck your garagantua breech cannot carry it away so
oh do not fret yourself thus never think on't
these are my brother's consorts these
these are his camerades his walking mates
he's a gallant cavaliero too right hangman cut
let me not live an i could not find in my heart to swinge the whole gang of 'em one after another and begin with him first
i am grieved it should be said he is my brother and take these courses well as he brews so shall he drink for george again
yet he shall hear on't and that tightly too an i live i'faith
but brother let your reprehension then run in an easy current not o'er high carried with rashness or devouring choler but rather use the soft persuading way whose powers will work more gently and compose the imperfect thoughts you labour to reclaim more winning than enforcing the consent
ay ay let me alone for that i warrant you
oh the bell rings to breakfast
brother i pray you go in and bear my wife company till i come i'll but give order for some despatch of business to my servants
enter with his tankard
our maids will have you by the back i'faith for coming so late this morning
perhaps so sir take heed somebody have not them by the belly for walking so late in the evening
well yet my troubled spirit's somewhat eased though not reposed in that security as i could wish but i must be content howe'er i set a face on't to the world
would i had lost this finger at a venture so wellbred had ne'er lodged within my house
why't cannot be where there is such resort of wanton gallants and young revellers that any woman should be honest long
is't like that factious beauty will preserve the public weal of chastity unshaken when such strong motives muster and make head against her single peace
when mutual appetite doth meet to treat and spirits of one kind and quality come once to parley in the pride of blood it is no slow conspiracy that follows
well to be plain if i but thought the time had answer'd their affections all the world should not persuade me but i were a cuckold
marry i hope they have not got that start for opportunity hath balk'd them yet and shall do still while i have eyes and ears to attend the impositions of my heart
my presence shall be as an iron bar 'twixt the conspiring motions of desire yea every look or glance mine eye ejects shall check occasion as one doth his slave when he forgets the limits of prescription
enter dame and dame sister bridget pray you fetch down the rose water above in the closet
sweet heart will you come in to breakfast
an she have overheard me now
dame i pray thee good muss we stay for you
by heaven i would not for a thousand angels
dame what ail you sweet heart
are you not well
troth my head akes extremely on a sudden
dame putting her hand to his forehead
dame alas how it burns
muss keep you warm good truth it is this new disease
there's a number are troubled withal
for love's sake sweetheart come in out of the air
how simple and how subtle are her answers
a new disease and many troubled with it
why true she heard me all the world to nothing
dame i pray thee good sweet heart come in the air will do you harm in troth
she has me in the wind
sweet heart i'll come to you presently 'twill away i hope
dame pray heaven it do
know not new or old but it may well be call'd poor mortals' plague for like a pestilence it doth infect the houses of the brain
first it begins solely to work upon the phantasy filling her seat with such pestiferous air as soon corrupts the judgment and from thence sends like contagion to the memory still each to other giving the infection
which as a subtle vapour spreads itself confusedly through every sensive part till not a thought or motion in the mind be free from the black poison of suspect
but what misery is it to know this
or knowing it to want the mind's erection in such extremes
well i will once more strive in spite of this black cloud myself to be and shake the fever off that thus shakes me
enter disguised like a maimed soldier
'slid i cannot choose but laugh to see myself translated thus from a poor creature to a creator for now must i create an intolerable sort of lies or my present profession loses the grace and yet the lie to a man of my coat is as ominous a fruit as the fico
o sir it holds for good polity ever to have that outwardly in vilest estimation that inwardly is most dear to us so much for my borrowed shape
well the troth is my old master intends to follow my young master dry foot over moorfields to london this morning now i knowing of this hunting match or rather conspiracy and to insinuate with my young master for so must we that are blue waiters and men of hope and service do or perhaps we may wear motley at the year's end and who wears motley you know have got me afore in this disguise determining here to lie in ambuscado and intercept him in the mid way
if i can but get his cloke his purse and his hat nay any thing to cut him off that is to stay his journey veni vidi vici i may say with captain caesar i am made for ever i'faith
well now i must practise to get the true garb of one of these lance knights my arm here and my odso
my young master and his cousin master stephen as i am true counterfeit man of war and no soldier
and how then coz
i have lost my purse i think
when had you it
i cannot tell stay
'slid i am afraid they will know me would i could get by them
what have you it
no i think i was bewitched i cries
nay do not weep the loss hang it let it go
oh it's here no an it had been lost i had not cared but for a jet ring mistress mary sent me
o the poesie the poesie
though fancy sleep my love is deep
meaning that though i did not fancy her yet she loved me dearly
and then i sent her another and my poesie was the deeper the sweeter i'll be judg'd by st
i do not conceive that
peter to make up the metre
well there the saint was your good patron he help'd you at your need thank him thank him
i cannot take leave on 'em so i will venture come what will
gentlemen please you change a few crowns for a very excellent blade here
i am a poor gentleman a soldier one that in the better state of my fortunes scorned so mean a refuge but now it is the humour of necessity to have it so
you seem to be gentlemen well affected to martial men else i should rather die with silence than live with shame however vouchsafe to remember it is my want speaks not myself this condition agrees not with my spirit know
where hast thou served
may it please you sir in all the late wars of bohemia hungary dalmatia poland where not sir
i have been a poor servitor by sea and land any time this fourteen years and followed the fortunes of the best commanders in christendom
i was twice shot at the taking of aleppo once at the relief of vienna i have been at marseilles naples and the adriatic gulf a gentleman slave in the gallies thrice where i was most dangerously shot in the head through both the thighs and yet being thus maimed i am void of maintenance nothing left me but my scars the noted marks of my resolution
how will you sell this rapier friend
generous sir i refer it to your own judgment you are a gentleman give me what you please
true i am a gentleman i know that friend but what though
i pray you say what would you ask
i assure you the blade may become the side or thigh of the best prince in europe
ay with a velvet scabbard i think
nay an't be mine it shall have a velvet scapbard coz that's flat i'd not wear it as it is an you would give me an angel brai
at your worship's pleasure sir nay 'tis a most pure toledo
i had rather it were a spaniard
but tell me what shall i give you for it
an it had a silver hilt know
come come you shall not buy it hold there's a shilling fellow take thy rapier
why but i will buy it now because you say so and there's another shilling fellow i scorn to be out bidden
what shall i walk with a cudgel like higginbottom and may have a rapier for money
you may buy one in the city
i'll buy this i' the field so i will i have a mind to't because 'tis a field rapier
tell me your lowest price
you shall not buy it say
by this money but i will though i give more than 'tis worth
come away you are a fool
friend i am a fool that's granted but i'll have it for that word's sake
follow me for your money
at your service sir
another part of moorfields
i cannot lose the thought yet of this letter sent to my son nor leave t' admire the change of manners and the breeding of our youth within the kingdom since myself was one when i was young he lived not in the stews durst have conceived a scorn and utter'd it on a gray head age was authority against a buffoon and a man had then a certain reverence paid unto his years that had none due unto his life so much the sanctity of some prevail'd for others
but now we all are fallen youth from their fear and age from that which bred it good example
nay would ourselves were not the first even parents that did destroy the hopes in our own children or they not learn'd our vices in their cradles and suck'd in our ill customs with their milk ere all their teeth be born or they can speak we make their palates cunning the first words we form their tongues with are licentious jests can it call whore
o then kiss it
give it two plums
nay rather than't shall learn no bawdy song the mother herself will teach it
but this is in the infancy the days of the long coat when it puts on the breeches it will put off all this ay it is like when it is gone into the bone already
no no this dye goes deeper than the coat or shirt or skin it stains into the liver and heart in some and rather than it should not note what we fathers do
look how we live
what mistresses we keep
at what expense in our sons' eyes
where they may handle our gifts hear our lascivious courtships see our dalliance taste of the same provoking meats with us to ruin of our states
nay when our own portion is fled to prey on the remainder we call them into fellowship of vice bait 'em with the young chamber maid to seal and teach 'em all bad ways to buy affliction
this is one path but there are millions more in which we spoil our own with leading them
well i thank heaven i never yet was he that travell'd with my son before sixteen to shew him the venetian courtezans nor read the grammar of cheating i had made to my sharp boy at twelve repeating still the rule get money still get money boy no matter by what means money will do more boy than my lord's letter
neither have i drest snails or mushrooms curiously before him perfumed my sauces and taught him how to make them preceding still with my gray gluttony at all the ord'naries and only fear'd his palate should degenerate not his manners
these are the trade of fathers now however my son i hope hath met within my threshold none of these household precedents which are strong and swift to rape youth to their precipice
but let the house at home be ne'er so clean swept or kept sweet from filth nay dust and cobwebs if he will live abroad with his companions in dung and leystals it is worth a fear nor is the danger of conversing less than all that i have mention'd of example
enter disguised as before
nay faith have at you i am flesh'd now i have sped so well
worshipful sir i beseech you respect the estate of a poor soldier lam ashamed of this base course of life god's my comfort but extremity provokes me to't what remedy
i have not for you now
by the faith i bear unto truth gentleman it is no ordinary custom in me but only to preserve manhood
i protest to you a man i have been a man i may be by your sweet bounty
pray thee good friend be satisfied
good sir by that hand you may do the part of a kind gentleman in lending a poor soldier the price of two cans of beer a matter of small value the king of heaven shall pay you and i shall rest thankful sweet worship know
nay an you be so importunate brai
need will have its course i was not made to this vile use
well the edge of the enemy could not have abated me so much it's hard when a man hath served in his prince's cause and be thus
honourable worship let me derive a small piece of silver from you it shall not be given in the course of time
by this good ground i was fain to pawn my rapier last night for a poor supper i had suck'd the hilts long before am a pagan else sweet honour know
believe me i am taken with some wonder to think a fellow of thy outward presence should in the frame and fashion of his mind be so degenerate and sordid base
art thou a man
and sham'st thou not to beg to practise such a servile kind of life
why were thy education ne'er so mean having thy limbs a thousand fairer courses offer themselves to thy election
either the wars might still supply thy wants or service of some virtuous gentleman or honest labour nay what can i name but would become thee better than to beg but men of thy condition feed on sloth as cloth the beetle on the dung she breeds in nor caring how the metal of your minds is eaten with the rust of idleness
now afore me whate'er he be that should relieve a person of thy quality while thou insist'st in this loose desperate course i would esteem the sin not thine but his
faith sir i would gladly find some other course if so know
ay you'd gladly find it but you will not seek it
alas sir where should a man seek
in the wars there's no ascent by desert in these days but and for service would it were as soon purchased as wished for
the air's my comfort
l know what i would say
please you fitz sword sir
say that a man should entertain thee now wouldst thou be honest humble just and true
sir by the place and honour of a soldier know
nay nay i like not these affected oaths speak plainly man what think'st thou of my words
nothing sir but wish my fortunes were as happy as my service should be honest
well follow me i'll prove thee if thy deeds will carry a proportion to thy words
yes sir straight i'll but garter my hose
oh that my belly were hoop'd now for i am ready to burst with laughing
never was bottle or bagpipe fuller
'slid was there ever seen a fox in years to betray himself thus
now shall i be possest of all his counsels and by that conduit my young master
well he is resolved to prove my honesty faith and i'm resolved to prove his patience oh i shall abuse him intolerably
this small piece of service will bring him clean out of love with the soldier for ever
he will never come within the sign of it the sight of a cassock or a musket rest again
he will hate the musters at mile end for it to his dying day
it's no matter let the world think me a bad counterfeit if i cannot give him the slip at an instant why this is better than to have staid his journey well i'll follow him
oh how i long to be employed
a room in the windmill tavern
enter master and mat
yes faith sir we were at your lodging to seek you too
wel oh i came not there to night
your brother delivered us as much
who my brother downright
wellbred i know not in what kind you hold me but let me say to you this as sure as honour i esteem it so much out of the sunshine of reputation to throw the least beam of regard upon such a wel
sir i must hear no ill words of my brother
i protest to you as i have a thing to be saved about me i never saw any gentlemanlike part wel
good captain faces about to some other discourse
with your leave sir an there were no more men living upon th' face of the earth i should not fancy him by st
troth nor i he is of a rustical cut i know not how he doth not carry himself like a gentleman of fashion
oh master mathew that's a grace peculiar but to a few quos aequus amavit jupiter
i understand you sir
no question you do or do you not sir
enter and master ned knowell
by my soul welcome how dost thou sweet spirit my genius
'slid i shall love apollo and the mad thespian girls the better while i live for this my dear fury now i see there's some love in thee
sirrah these be the two i writ to thee of nay what a drowsy humour is this now
why dost thou not speak
oh you are a fine gallant you sent me a rare letter
why was't not rare
yes i'll be sworn i was ne'er guilty of reading the like match it in all pliny or symmachus's epistles and i'll have my judgment burn'd in the ear for a rogue make much of thy vein for it is inimitable
but i marle what camel it was that had the carriage of it for doubtless he was no ordinary beast that brought it
why dost thou think that any reasonable creature especially in the morning the sober time of the day too could have mistaken my father for me
'slid you jest i hope
indeed the best use we can turn it to is to make a jest on't now but i'll assure you my father had the full view of your flourishing style some hour before i saw it
what a dull slave was this
but sirrah what said he to it i'faith
nay i know not what he said but i have a shrewd guess what he thought
marry that thou art some strange dissolute young fellow and i a grain or two better for keeping thee company
that thought is like the moon in her last quarter 'twill change shortly but sirrah i pray thee be acquainted with my two hang by's here thou wilt take exceeding pleasure in them if thou hear'st 'em once go my wind instruments i'll wind them up but what strange piece of silence is this the sign of the dumb man
oh sir a kinsman of mine one that may make your music the fuller an he please he has his humour sir
oh what is't what is't
nay i'll neither do your judgment nor his folly that wrong as to prepare your apprehension i'll leave him to the mercy of your search if you can take him so
well captain bobadill master mathew pray you know this gentleman here he is a friend of mine and one that will deserve your affection
i know not your name sir to stephen
but i shall be glad of any occasion to render me more familiar to you
my name is master stephen sir i am this gentleman's own cousin sir his father is mine uncle sir i am somewhat melancholy but you shall command me sir in whatsoever is incident to a gentleman
sir i must tell you this i am no general man but for master wellbred's sake you may embrace it at what height of favour you please i do communicate with you and conceive you to be a gentleman of some parts i love few words
and i fewer sir i have scarce enough to thank you
but are you indeed sir so given to it
ay truly sir i am mightily given to melancholy
oh it's your only fine humour sir your true melancholy breeds your perfect fine wit sir
i am melancholy myself diver times sir and then do i no more but take pen and paper presently and overflow you half a score or a dozen of sonnets at a sitting
sure he utters them then by the gross
truly sir and i love such things out of measure
i'faith better than in measure i'll undertake
why i pray you sir make use of my study it's at your service
i thank you sir i shall be bold i warrant you have you a stool there to be melancholy upon
that i have sir and some papers there of mine own doing at idle hours that you'll say there's some sparks of wit in 'em when you see them wel
would the sparks would kindle once and become a fire amongst them
i might see self love burnt for her heresy
cousin is it well
am i melancholy enough
know oh ay excellent
captain bobadill why muse you so
he is melancholy too
faith sir i was thinking of a most honourable piece of service was performed to morrow being st
mark's day shall be some ten years now
in what place captain
why at the beleaguering of strigonium where in less than two hours seven hundred resolute gentlemen as any were in europe lost their lives upon the breach
i'll tell you gentlemen it was the first but the best leaguer that ever i beheld with these eyes except the taking in of what do you call it
last year by the genoways but that of all other was the most fatal and dangerous exploit that ever i was ranged in since i first bore arms before the face of the enemy as i am a gentleman and a soldier
i had as lief as an angel i could swear as well as that gentleman
then you were a servitor at both it seems at strigonium and what do you call't
george i was the first man that entered the breach and had i not effected it with resolution i had been slain if i had had a million of lives
'twas pity you had not ten a cat's and your own i'faith
but was it possible
pray you mark this discourse sir
i assure' you upon my reputation 'tis true and you shall confess
you must bring me to the rack first
observe me judicially sweet sir they had planted me three demi culverins just in the mouth of the breach now sir as we were to give on their master gunner a man of no mean skill and mark you must think confronts me with his linstock ready to give fire i spying his intendment discharged my petronel in his bosom and with these single arms my poor rapier ran violently upon the moors that guarded the ordnance and put them pell mell to the sword
to the rapier captain
oh it was a good figure observed sir but did you all this captain without hurting your blade
without any impeach the earth you shall perceive sir
it is the most fortunate weapon that ever rid on poor gentleman's thigh
shall i tell you sir
you talk of morglay excalibur durindana or so tut
i lend no credit to that is fabled of 'em i know the virtue of mine own and therefore i dare the boldlier maintain it
i marle whether it be a toledo or no
a most perfect toledo i assure you sir
i have a countryman of his here
pray you let's see sir yes faith it is
why do you pish captain
a fleming by heaven
i'll buy them for a guilder a piece
an i would have a thousand of them
how say you cousin
i told you thus much
where bought you it master stephen
of a scurvy rogue soldier a hundred of lice go with him
he swore it was a toledo
a poor provant rapier no better
mass i think it be indeed now i look on't better
nay the longer you look on't the worse
put it up put it up
well i will put it up but by i have forgot the captain's oath i thought to have sword
by it an e'er i meet him wel
o it is past help now sir you must have patience
whoreson coney hatching rascal
i could eat the very hilts for anger
a sign of good digestion you have an ostrich stomach cousin
would i had him here you should see an i had a stomach
it's better as it is
come gentlemen shall we go
enter disguised as before
a miracle cousin look here look here

gentlemen bear witness he has confest it 'od's will an you had not confest it
oh cousin forbear forbear
nay i have done cousin
why you have done like a gentleman he has confest it what would you more
yet by his leave he is a rascal under his favour do you see
ay by his leave he is and under favour a pretty piece of civility
sirrah how dost thou like him
oh it's a most precious fool make much on him i can compare him to nothing more happily than a drum for every one may play upon him
no no a child's whistle were far the fitter
shall i intreat a word with you
you have not another toledo to sell have you
you are conceited sir your name is master knowell as i take it
you are in the right you mean not to proceed in the catechism do you
no sir i am none of that coat
of as bare a coat though well say sir
faith sir i am but servant to the drum extraordinary and indeed this smoky varnish being washed off and three or four patches removed i appear your worship's in reversion after the decease of your good father brainworm
'slight what breath of a conjurer hath blown thee hither in this shape
the breath of your letter sir this morning the same that blew you to the windmill and your father after you
nay never start 'tis true he has followed you over the fields by the foot as you would do a hare in the snow
sirrah wellbred what shall we do sirrah
my father is come over after me
at justice clement's house in coleman street where he but stays my return and then wel
why how in the name of wit com'st thou transmuted thus
faith a device a device nay for the love of reason gentlemen and avoiding the danger stand not here withdraw and i'll tell you all
but art thou sure he will stay thy return
do i live sir
what a question is that
we'll prorogue his expectation then a little brainworm thou shalt go with us
== nay i pray thee sweet ned droop not 'heart an our wits be so wretchedly dull that one old plodding brain can outstrip us all would we were e'en prest to make porters of and serve out the remnant of our days in thames street or at custom house key in a civil war against the carmen
amen amen amen say exeunt
what says he thomas
did you speak with him
he will expect you sir within this half hour
has he the money ready can you tell
yes sir the money was brought in last night
o that is well fetch me my cloak my cloak
stay let me see an hour to go and come ay that will be the least and then 'twill be an hour before i can dispatch with him or very near well i will say two hours
things never dreamt of yet may be contrived ay and effected too in two hours' absence well i will not go
no fleering opportunity i will not give your subtilty that scope
who will not judge him worthy to be robb'd that sets his doors wide open to a thief and shews the felon where his treasure lies
again what earthly spirit but will attempt to taste the fruit of beauty's golden tree when leaden sleep seals up the dragon's eyes
i will not go
business go by for once
no beauty no you are of too good caract to be left so without a guard or open your lustre too 'll inflame at any distance draw courtship to you as a jet doth straws put motion in a stone strike fire from ice nay make a porter leap you with his burden
you must be then kept up close and well watch'd for give you opportunity no quick sand devours or swallows swifter
he that lends his wife if she be fair or time or place compels her to be false
i will not go
the dangers are too many and then the dressing is a most main attractive
our great heads within this city never were in safety since our wives wore these little caps i'll change 'em i'll change 'em straight in mine mine shall no more wear three piled acorns to make my horns ake
nor will i go i am resolved for that
re enter with a cloak
carry in my cloak again
yet do too i will defer going on all occasions
sir snare your scrivener will be there with the bonds
that's true fool on me
i had clean forgot it i must go
'heart then will wellbred presently be here too with one or other of his loose consorts
i am a knave if i know what to say what course to take or which way to resolve
my brain methinks is like an hour glass wherein my imaginations run like sands filling up time but then are turn'd and turn'd so that i know not what to stay upon and less to put in act
it shall be so
nay i dare build upon his secrecy he knows not to deceive me
yet now i have bethought me too i will not
thomas is cob within
i think he be sir
but he'll prate too there is no speech of him
no there were no man on the earth to thomas if i durst trust him there is all the doubt
but should he have a clink in him i were gone
lost in my fame for ever talk for th' exchange
the manner he hath stood with till this present doth promise no such change what should i fear then
well come what will i'll tempt my fortune once
thomas you may deceive me but i hope your love to me is more cash
sir if a servant's duty with faith may be call'd love you are more than in hope you are possess'd of it
i thank you heartily thomas give me your hand with all my heart good thomas
i have thomas a secret to impart unto you but when once you have it i must seal your lips up so far i tell you thomas
sir for that kit
nay hear me out
think i esteem you thomas when i will let you in thus to my private
it is a thing sits nearer to my crest than thou art 'ware of thomas if thou should'st reveal it but cash
how i reveal it
nay i do not think thou would'st but if thou should'st 'twere a great weakness
a great treachery give it no other name
thou wilt not do't then
sir if i do mankind disclaim me ever
he will not swear he has some reservation some conceal'd purpose and close meaning sure else being urg'd so much how should he choose but lend an oath to all this protestation
he's no precisian that i'm certain of nor rigid roman catholic he'll play at fayles and tick tack i have heard him swear
what should i think of it
urge him again and by some other way
i will do so
well thomas thou hast sworn not to disclose yes you did swear
not yet sir but i will please you kit
no thomas i dare take thy word but if thou wilt swear do as thou think'st good i am resolv'd without it at thy pleasure
by my soul's safety then sir i protest my tongue shall ne'er take knowledge of a word deliver'd me in nature of your trust
it is too much these ceremonies need not i know thy faith to be as firm as rock
thomas come hither near we cannot be too private in this business
so it is now he has sworn i dare the safelier venture
i have of late by divers observations but whether his oath can bind him yea or no being not taken lawfully
i will ask council ere i do proceed aside
thomas it will be now too long to stay i'll spy some fitter time soon or to morrow
sir at your pleasure
i will think and thomas i pray you search the books 'gainst my return for the receipts 'twixt me and traps
and hear you if your mistress's brother wellbred chance to bring hither any gentleman ere i come back let one straight bring me word
to the exchange do you hear
or here in coleman street to justice clement's
forget it not nor be not out of the way
i will not sir
i pray you have a care on't
or whether he come or no if any other stranger or else fail not to send me word
i shall not sir
be it your special business now to remember it
sir i warrant you
but thomas this is not the secret thomas i told you of
no sir i do suppose it
believe me it is not
sir i do believe you
by heaven it is not that's enough but thomas i would not you should utter it do you see to any creature living yet i care not
well i must hence
thomas conceive thus much it was a trial of you when i meant so deep a secret to you i mean not this but that i have to tell you this is nothing this
but thomas keep this from my wife i charge you lock'd up in silence midnight buried here
no greater hell than to be slave to fear
lock'd up in silence midnight buried here
whence should this flood of passion trow take head
best dream no longer of this running humour for fear i sink the violence of the stream already hath transported me so far that i can feel no ground at all but soft oh 'tis our water bearer somewhat has crost him now
what tell you me of fasting days
'slid would they were all on a light fire for me
they say the whole world shall be consumed with fire one day but would i had these ember weeks and villanous fridays burnt in the mean time and then cash
why how now cob
what moves thee to this choler ha
i scorn your collar i sir i am none your cart horse though i carry and draw water
an you offer to ride me with your collar or halter either i may hap shew you a jade's trick sir
o you'll slip your head out of the collar
why goodman cob you mistake me
nay i have my rheum and i can be angry as well as another sir
thy humour thy humour thou misstak'st
mack i think it be so indeed what is that humour
some rare thing i warrant
marry i'll tell thee cob it is a gentlemanlike monster bred in the special gallantry of our time by affectation and fed by folly
must it be fed
oh ay humour is nothing if it be not fed didst thou never hear that
it's a common phrase feed my humour
i'll none on it humour avaunt
i know you not be gone
let who will make hungry meals for your monstership it shall not be feed you quoth he
'slid i have much ado to feed myself especially on these lean rascally days too an't had been any other day but a fasting day a plague on them all for me
by this light one might have done the commonwealth good service and have drown'd them all in the flood two or three hundred thousand years ago
o i do stomach them hugely
i have a maw now and 'twere for sir bevis his horse against them
i pray thee good cob what makes thee so out of love with fasting days
marry that which will make any man out of love with 'em i think their bad conditions an you will needs know
first they are of a flemish breed i am sure on't for they raven up more butter than all the days of the week beside next they stink of fish and leek porridge miserably thirdly they'll keep a man devoutly hungry all day and at night send him supperless to bed
indeed these are faults cob
nay an this were all 'twere something but they are the only known enemies to my generation
a fasting day no sooner comes but my lineage goes to wrack poor cobs
they smoak for it they are made martyrs the gridiron they melt in passion and your maids to know this and yet would have me turn hannibal and eat my own flesh and blood
my princely coz pulls out a red herring fear nothing i have not the heart to devour you an i might be made as rich as king cophetua
o that i had room for my tears i could weep salt water enough now to preserve the lives of ten thousand thousand of my kin
but i may curse none but these filthy almanacks for an't were not for them these days of persecution would never be known
i'll be hang'd an some fish monger's son do not make of 'em and puts in more fasting days than he should do because he would utter his father's dried stock fish and stinking conger
thou'lt be beaten like a stock fish else here's master mathew
enter and now must i look out for a messenger to my master
wel beshrew me but it was an absolute good jest and exceedingly well carried
ay and our ignorance maintain'd it as well did it not
yes faith but was it possible thou shouldst not know him
i forgive master stephen for he is stupidity itself
'fore god not i an i might have been join'd patten with one of the seven wise masters for knowing him
he had so writhen himself into the habit of one of your poor infantry your decayed ruinous worm eaten gentlemen of the round such as have vowed to sit on the skirts of the city let your provost and his half dozen of halberdiers do what they can and have translated begging out of the old hackney pace to a fine easy amble and made it run as smooth off the tongue as a shove groat shilling
into the likeness of one of these reformados had he moulded himself so perfectly observing every trick of their action as varying the accent swearing with an emphasis indeed all with so special and exquisite a grace that hadst thou seen him thou wouldst have sworn he might have been sergeant major if not lieutenant colonel to the regiment
why brainworm who would have thought thou hadst been such an artificer
except a man had studied begging all his life time and been a weaver of language from his infancy for the cloathing of it i never saw his rival
where got'st thou this coat i marle
of a hounsditch man sir one of the devil's near kinsmen a broker
that cannot be if the proverb hold for crafty knave needs no broker
true sir but i did need a broker ergo wel
well put off no crafty knave you'll say
tut he has more of these shifts
and yet where i have one the broker has ten sir
ne'er a one to be found now
what a spite's this
is my brother kitely within
no sir my master went forth e'en now but master downright is within
is he gone too
whither went your master thomas canst thou tell
i know not to justice clement's i think sir cob
why dost thou not know him
he is a city magistrate a justice here an excellent good lawyer and a great scholar but the only mad merry old fellow in europe
i shewed him you the other day
oh is that he
i remember him now
good faith and he is a very strange presence methinks it shews as if he stood out of the rank from other men i have heard many of his jests in the university
they say he will commit a man for taking the wall of his horse
ay or wearing his cloak on one shoulder or serving of god any thing indeed if it come in the way of his humour
'heart where should they be trow
master kitely's man pray thee vouchsafe us the lighting of this match
fire on your match
no time but now to vouchsafe
here's the remainder of seven pound since yesterday was seven night
'tis your right trinidado did you never take any master stephen
no truly sir but i'll learn to take it now since you commend it so
sir believe me upon my relation for what i tell you the world shall not reprove
i have been in the indies where this herb grows where neither myself nor a dozen gentlemen more of my knowledge have received the taste of any other nutriment in the world for the space of one and twenty weeks but the fume of this simple only therefore it cannot be but 'tis most divine
further take it in the nature in the true kind so it makes an antidote that had you taken the most deadly poisonous plant in all italy it should expel it and clarify you with as much ease as i speak
and for your green wound your balsamum and your st
john's wort are all mere gulleries and trash to it especially your trinidado your nicotian is good too
i could say what i know of the virtue of it for the expulsion of rheums raw humours crudities obstructions with a thousand of this kind but i profess myself no quack salver
only thus much by hercules i do hold it and will affirm it before any prince in europe to be the most sovereign and precious weed that ever the earth tendered to the use of man
this speech would have done decently in a tobacco trader's mouth
re enter with cash
at justice clement's he is in the middle of coleman street
where's the match i gave thee master kitely's man
would his match and he and pipe and all were at sancto domingo
i had forgot it
'od's me i marle what pleasure or felicity they have in taking this roguish tobacco
it's good for nothing but to choke a man and fill him full of smoke and embers there were four died out of one house last week with taking of it and two more the bell went for yesternight one of them they say will never scape it he voided a bushel of soot yesterday upward and downward
by the stocks an there were no wiser men than i i'd have it present whipping man or woman that should but deal with a tobacco pipe why it will stifle them all in the end as many as use it it's little better than ratsbane or rosaker
oh good captain hold hold
you base cullion you
sir here's your match
come thou must needs be talking too thou'rt well enough served
nay he will not meddle with his match i warrant you well it shall be a dear beating an i live
do you prate do you murmur
nay good captain will you regard the humour of a fool
thomas get him away
exit cash with cob
a whoreson filthy slave a dung worm an excrement
body caesar but that i scorn to let forth so mean a spirit i'd have stabb'd him to the earth
marry the law forbid sir
by pharaoh's foot i would have done it
oh he swears most admirably
i shall never do it sure
upon mine honour and by st
no i have not the right grace
master stephen will you any

as i remember your name is entered in the artillery garden
ay sir that's true

o let's follow them master mathew is gone to salute his mistress in verse we shall have the happiness to hear some of his poetry now he never comes unfinished
ay cousin no words of it upon your gentility

tut beside him what strangers are there man
let me see one two mass i know not well there are so many

nay when such flowing store plenty itself falls into my wife's lap the cornucopiae will be mine i know
but cob what entertainment had they
i am sure my sister and my wife would bid them welcome ha
like enough sir yet i heard not a word of it
no their lips were seal'd with kisses and the voice drown'd in a flood of joy at their arrival had lost her motion state and faculty
cob which of them was it that first kiss'd my wife my sister i should say
i fear not her ha
who was it say'st thou
by my troth sir will you have the truth of it
oh ay good cob i pray thee heartily
then i am a vagabond and fitter for bridewell than your worship's company if i saw any body to be kiss'd unless they would have kiss'd the post in the middle of the warehouse for there i left them all at their tobacco with a pox
were they not gone in then ere thou cam'st
spite of the devil
what do i stay here then
nay soft and fair i have eggs on the spit i cannot go yet sir
now am i for some five and fifty reasons hammering hammering revenge oh for three or four gallons of vinegar to sharpen my wits
revenge vinegar revenge vinegar and mustard revenge
nay an he had not lien in my house 'twould never have grieved me but being my guest one that i'll be sworn my wife has lent him her smock off her back while his own shirt has been at washing pawned her neck kerchers for clean bands for him sold almost all my platters to buy him tobacco and he to turn monster of ingratitude and strike his lawful host

well by this light a little thing would make me play the devil with some of them an 'twere not more for your husband's sake than anything else i'd make the house too hot for the best on 'em they should say and swear hell were broken loose ere they went hence
but by god's will 'tis nobody's fault but yours for an you had done as you might have done they should have been parboiled and baked too every mother's son ere they should have come in e'er a one of them
dame god's my life

i'll mar the knot of 'em ere i sleep perhaps especially bob there he that's all manner of shapes and songs and sonnets his fellow
brother indeed you are too violent too sudden in your humour and you know my brother wellbred's temper will not bear any reproof chiefly in such a presence where every slight disgrace he should receive might wound him in opinion and respect
what talk you of respect among such as have no spark of manhood nor good manners
'sdeins i am ashamed to hear you'

o that was some love of yours sister

o the justice the honestest old brave trojan in london i do honour the very flea of his dog

i thank the devil and his good angel my guest

friend am i worth belief
come do not protest
in faith she is a maid of good ornament and much modesty and except i conceived very worthily of her thou should'st not have her

was your man a soldier sir
ay a knave i took him begging the way this morning as i came over moorfields
enter disguised as before
o here he is
you've made fair speed believe me where in the name of sloth could you be thus
marry peace be my comfort where i thought i should have had little comfort of your worship's service
o sir your coming to the city your entertainment of me and your sending me to watch indeed all the circumstances either of your charge or my employment are as open to your son as to yourself
how should that be unless that villain brainworm have told him of the letter and discover'd all that i strictly charg'd him to conceal
i am partly the faith 'tis so indeed
but how should he know thee to be my man
nay sir i cannot tell unless it be by the black art
is not your son a scholar sir
yes but i hope his soul is not allied unto such hellish practice if it were i had just cause to weep my part in him and curse the time of his creation
but where didst thou find them fitz sword
you should rather ask where they found me sir for i'll be sworn i was going along in the street thinking nothing when of a sudden a voice calls mr
and thus half a dozen of them till they had call'd me within a house where i no sooner came but they seem'd men and out flew all their rapiers at my bosom with some three or four score oaths to accompany them and all to tell me i was but a dead man if i did not confess where you were and how i was employed and about what which when they could not get out of me as i protest they must have dissected and made an anatomy of me first and so i told them they lock'd me up into a room in the top of a high house whence by great miracle having a light heart i slid down by a bottom of packthread into the street and so 'scaped
but sir thus much i can assure you for i heard it while i was lock'd up there were a great many rich merchants and brave citizens' wives with them at a feast and your son master edward withdrew with one of them and has 'pointed to meet her anon at one cob's house a water bearer that dwells by the wall
now there your worship shall be sure to take him for there he preys and fail he will not
nor will i fail to break his match i doubt not
go thoualong with justice clement's man and stay there for me
at one cob's house say'st thou
ay sir there you shall have him
much wench or much son
'slight when he has staid there three or four hours travailing with the expectation of wonders and at length be deliver'd of air
o the sport that i should then take to look on him if i durst
but now i mean to appear no more afore him in this shape i have another trick to act yet
o that i were so happy as to light on a nupson now of this justice's novice
sir i make you stay somewhat long
not a whit sir
pray you what do you mean sir
i was putting up some papers
you have been lately in the wars sir it seems
marry have i sir to my loss and expense of all almost
troth sir i would be glad to bestow a bottle of wine on you if it please you to accept it brai o sir form
but to hear the manner of your services and your devices in the wars they say they be very strange and not like those a man reads in the roman histories or sees at mile end
no i assure you sir why at any time when it please you i shall be ready to discourse to you all i know and more too somewhat
no better time than now sir we'll go to the windmill there we shall have a cup of neat grist we call it
i pray you sir let me request you to the windmill
i'll follow you sir and make grist of you if i have good luck
sir did your eyes ever taste the like clown of him where we were to day mr
i think the whole earth cannot shew his parallel by this daylight
we were now speaking of him captain bobadill tells me he is fallen foul of you too
o ay sir he threatened me with the bastinado
ay but i think i taught you prevention this morning for that you shall kill him beyond question if you be so generously minded
indeed it is a most excellent trick
bob o you do not give spirit enough to your motion you are too tardy too heavy
o it must be done like lightning hay
practises at a post with his cudgel
'tis nothing an't be not done in a punto
captain did you ever prove yourself upon any of our masters of defence here
yes i hope he has
i will tell you sir
upon my first coming to the city after my long travel for knowledge in that mystery only there came three or four of them to me at a gentleman's house where it was my chance to be resident at that time to intreat my presence at their schools and withal so much importuned me that i protest to you as i am a gentleman i was ashamed of their rude demeanour out of all measure well i told them that to come to a public school they should pardon me it was opposite in diameter to my humour but if so be they would give their attendance at my lodging i protested to do them what right or favour i could as i was a gentleman and so forth
then you tried their skill
alas soon tried you shall hear sir
within two or three days after they came and by honesty fair sir believe me i graced them exceedingly shewed them some two or three tricks of prevention have purchased them since a credit to admiration they cannot deny this and yet now they hate me and why
because i am excellent and for no other vile reason on the earth
this is strange and barbarous as ever i heard
nay for a more instance of their preposterous natures but note sir
they have assaulted me some three four five six of them together as i have walked alone in divers skirts it'll town as turnbull whitechapel shoreditch which were then my quarters and since upon the exchange at my lodging and at my ordinary where i have driven them afore me the whole length of a street in the open view of all our gallants pitying to hurt them believe me
yet all this lenity will not overcome their spleen they will be doing with the pismire raising a hill a man may spurn abroad with his foot at pleasure
by myself i could have slain them all but i delight not in murder
i am loth to bear any other than this bastinado for them yet i hold it good polity not to go disarmed for though i be skilful i may be oppressed with multitudes
ay believe me may you sir and in my conceit our whole nation should sustain the loss by it if it were so
what's a peculiar man to a nation
o but your skill sir
indeed that might be some loss but who respects it
i will tell you sir by the way of private and under seal i am a gentleman and live here obscure and to myself but were i known to her majesty and the lords observe me i would undertake upon this poor head and life for the public benefit of the state not only to spare the entire lives of her subjects in general but to save the one half nay three parts of her yearly charge in holding war and against what enemy soever
and how would i do it think you
nay i know not nor can i conceive
i would select nineteen more to myself
throughout the land gentlemen they should be of good spirit strong and able constitution i would choose them by an instinct a character that i have and i would teach these nineteen the special rules as your punto your reverso your stoccata your imbroccato your passada your montanto till they could all play very near or altogether as well as myself
this done say the enemy were forty thousand strong we twenty would come into the field the tenth of march or thereabouts and we would challenge twenty of the enemy they could not in their honour refuse us well we would kill them challenge twenty more kill them twenty more kill them twenty more kill them too and thus would we kill every man his twenty a day that's twenty score twenty score that's two hundred two hundred a day five days a thousand forty thousand forty times five five times forty two hundred days kills them all up by computation
and this will i venture my poor gentlemanlike carcase to perform provided there be no treason practised upon us by fair and discreet manhood that is civilly by the sword
why are you so sure of your hand captain at all times
never miss thrust upon my reputation with you
i would not stand in downright's state then an you meet him for the wealth of anyone street in london
why sir you mistake me if he were here now by this welkin i would not draw my weapon on him
let this gentleman do his mind but i will bastinado him by the bright sun wherever i meet him
faith and i'll have a fling at him at my distance
'od's so look where he is
downright crosses the stage
what peevish luck have i i cannot meet with these bragging rascals
it is not he is it
yes faith it is he
i'll be hang'd then if that were he
sir keep your hanging good for some greater matter for i assure you that were he
upon my reputation it was he
had i thought it had been he he must not have gone so but i can hardly be induced to believe it was he yet
that i think sir
re enter but see he is come again
o pharaoh's foot have i found you
come draw to your tools draw gipsy or i'll thrash you
gentleman of valour i do believe in thee hear me dow
draw your weapon then
tall man i never thought on it till now body of me i had a warrant of the peace served on me even now as i came along by a water bearer this gentleman saw it master mathew
you will not draw then
disarms and beats him
under thy favour forbear
prate again as you like this you whoreson foist you
you'll control the point you
your consort is gone had he staid he had shared with you sir
well gentlemen bear witness i was bound to the peace by this good day
no faith it's an ill day captain never reckon it other but say you were bound to the peace the law allows you to defend yourself that will prove but a poor excuse
i cannot tell sir i desire good construction in fair sort
i never sustain'd the like disgrace by heaven
sure i was struck with a planet thence for i had no power to touch my weapon
ay like enough i have heard of many that have been beaten under a planet go get you to a surgeon
an these be your tricks your passadoes and your montantos i'll none of them
that this age should bring forth such creatures
that nature should be at leisure to make them
mass i'll have this cloak
'od's will 'tis downright's
nay it's mine now another might have ta'en it up as well i'll wear it so i will
how an he see it
he'll challenge it assure yourself
ay but he shall not have it i'll say i bought it
take heed you buy it not too dear coz
a room in house
enter dame and kit
now trust me brother you were much to blame incense his anger and disturb the peace of my poor house where there are sentinels that every minute watch to give alarms of civil war without adjection of your assistance or occasion
no harm done brother i warrant you since there is no harm done anger costs a man nothing and a tall man is never his own man till he be angry
to keep his valour in obscurity is to keep himself as it were in a cloak bag
what's a musician unless he play
what's a tall man unless he fight
for indeed all this my wise brother stands upon absolutely and that made me fall in with him so resolutely
dame ay but what harm might have come of it brother
so might the good warm clothes your husband wears be poisoned for any thing he knows or the wholesome wine he drank even now at the table
now i remember my wife drank to me last and changed the cup and bade me wear this cursed suit to day
see if heaven suffer murder undiscover'd
i feel me ill give me some mithridate some mithridate and oil good sister fetch me o i am sick at heart i burn
if you will save my life go fetch it me
my very breath has poison'd him
good brother be content what do you mean
the strength of these extreme conceits will kill you
dame beshrew your heart blood brother wellbred now for putting such a toy into his head
is a fit simile a toy
will he be poison'd with a simile
brother kitely what a strange and idle imagination is this
for shame be wiser
my soul there's no such matter
am i not sick
how am i then not poison'd
am i not poison'd
how am i then so sick
dame if you be sick your own thoughts make you sick
his jealousy is the poison he has taken
enter disguised in clothes
master kitely my master justice clement salutes you and desires to speak with you with all possible speed
no time but now when i think i am sick very sick
well i will wait upon his worship
i must seek them out and set them sentinels till i return
this is perfectly rare brainworm takes him aside
but how got'st thou this apparel of the justice's man
marry sir my proper fine pen man would needs bestow the grist on me at the windmill to hear some martial discourse where i so marshall'd him that i made him drunk with admiration and because too much heat was the cause of his distemper i stript him stark naked as he lay along asleep and borrowed his suit to deliver this counterfeit message in leaving a rusty armour and an old brown bill to watch him till my return which shall be when i have pawn'd his apparel and spent the better part the money perhaps
well thou art a successful merry knave brainworm his absence will be a good subject for more mirth
i pray thee return to thy young master and will him to meet me and my sister bridget at the tower instantly for here tell him the house is so stored with jealousy there is no room for love to stand up'right in
we must get our fortunes committed to some larger prison say and than the tower i know no better air nor where the liberty of the house may do us more present service
re enter talking aside to kit
now my secret's ripe and thou shalt have it lay to both thine ears
hark what i say to thee
i must go forth thomas be careful of thy promise keep good watch note every gallant and observe him well that enters in my absence to thy mistress if she would shew him rooms the jest is stale follow them thomas or else hang on him and let him not go after mark their looks note if she offer but to see his band or any other amorous toy about him but praise his leg or foot or if she say the day is hot and bid him feel her hand how hot it is o that's a monstrous thing
note me all this good thomas mark their sighs and if they do but whisper break 'em off i'll bear thee out in it
wilt thou do this
wilt thou be true my thomas
as truth's self sir
why i believe thee where is cob now
dame he's ever calling for cob i wonder how he employs cob so
indeed sister to ask how he employs cob is a necessary question for you that are his wife and a thing not very easy for you to be satisfied in but this i'll assure you cob's wife is an excellent bawd sister and oftentimes your husband haunts her house marry to what end
i cannot altogether accuse him imagine you what you think convenient but i have known fair hides have foul hearts ere now sister
dame never said you truer than that brother so much i can tell you for your learning
thomas fetch your cloak and go with me
i'll after him presently i would to fortune i could take him there i'faith i'd return him his own i warrant him
so let 'em go this may make sport anon
now my fair sister in law that you knew but how happy a thing it were to be fair and beautiful
that touches not me brother
that's true that's even the fault of it for indeed beauty stands a woman in no stead unless it procure her touching
but sister whether it touch you or no
it touches your beauties and i am sure they will abide the touch an they do not a plague of all ceruse say and it touches me too in part though not in the well there's a dear and respected friend of mine sister stands very strongly and worthily affected toward you and hath vowed to inflame whole bonfires of zeal at his heart in honour of your perfections
i have already engaged my promise to bring you where you shall hear him confirm much more
ned knowell is the man sister there's no exception against the party
you are ripe for a husband and a minute's loss to such all occasion is a great trespass in a wise beauty
what say you sister
on 'my soul he loves you will you give him the meeting
faith i had very little confidence in mine own constancy brother if i durst not meet a man but this motion of yours savours of an old knight adventurer's servant a little too much methinks
what' s that sister
marry of the squire
no matter if it did i would be such an one for my friend
but see who is return'd to hinder us
what villainy is this
call'd out on a false message
this was some plot i was not sent for
bridget where is your sister

whither for god's sake
she's gone abroad with thomas
oh that villain dors me beast that i was to trust him
whither i pray you went she
i know not sir
i'll tell you brother whither i suspect she's gone kit
to cob's house i believe but keep my counsel
i will i will to cob's house
doth she haunt cob's
she's gone a purpose now to cuckold me with that lewd rascal who to win her favour hath told her all
come he is once more gone sister let's lose no time the affair is worth it
i wonder captain what they will say of my going away ha
why what should they say but as of a discreet gentleman quick wary respectful of nature's fair lineaments
but what can they say of your beating
a rude part a touch with soft wood a kind of gross battery used laid on strongly borne most patiently and that's all
ay but would any man have offered it in venice as you say
i assure you no you shall have there your nobilis your gentilezza come in bravely upon your reverse stand you close stand you firm stand you fair save your retricato with his left leg come to the assalto with the right thrust with brave steel defy your base wood
but wherefore do i awake this remembrance
i was fascinated by jupiter fascinated but i will be unwitch'd and revenged by law

sir you know i love not to have my favours come hard from me
you have your pardon though i suspect you shrewdly for being of counsel with my son against me
yes faith i have sir though you retain'd me doubly this morning for yourself first as brainworm after as fitz sword
i was your reform'd soldier sir
'twas i sent you to cob's upon the errand without end
or that thou should'st disguise thy language so as i should not know thee
o sir this has been the day of my metamorphosis
it is not that shape alone that i have run through to day
i brought this gentleman master kitely a message too in the form of master justice's man here to draw him out the way as well as your worship while master wellbred might make a conveyance of mistress bridget to my young master
my sister stolen away
my son is not married i hope
faith sir they are both as sure as love a priest and three thousand pound which is her portion can make them and by this time are ready to bespeak their wedding supper at the windmill except some friend here prevent them and invite them home
marry that will i i thank thee for putting me in mind on't
sirrah go you and fetch them hither upon my warrant
neither's friends have cause to be sorry if i know the young couple aright
here i drink to thee for thy good news
but i pray thee what hast thou done with my man formal
faith sir after some ceremony past as making him drunk first with story and then with wine but all in kindness and stripping him to his shirt i left him in that cool vein departed sold your worship's warrant to these two pawn'd his livery for that varlet's gown to serve it in and thus have brought myself by my activity to your worship's consideration
and i will consider thee in another cup of sack
here's to thee which having drunk off this my sentence pledge me
thou hast done or assisted to nothing in my judgment but deserves to be pardon'd for the wit of the offence
if thy master or any man here be angry with thee i shall suspect his ingine while i know him for't
how now what noise is that
sir it is roger is come home
bring him in bring him in
enter in a suit of armour
in arms against me
your reason your reason for this
i beseech your worship to pardon me i happened into ill company by chance that cast me into a sleep and stript me of all my clothes
well tell him i am justice clement and do pardon him but what is this to your armour
what may that signify
an't please you sir it hung up in the room where i was stript and i borrow'd it of one of the drawers to come home in because i was loth to do penance through the street in my shirt
well stand by a while
enter and who be these
o the young company welcome welcome
nay mistress bridget blush not you are not so fresh a bride but the news of it is come hither afore you
master bridegroom i have made your peace give me your hand so will i for all the rest ere you forsake my roof
we are the more bound to your humanity sir
only these two have so little of man in them they are no part of my care
yes sir let me pray you for this gentleman he belongs to my sister the bride
in what place sir
of her delight sir below the stairs and in public her poet sir
i will challenge him myself presently at extempore
mount up thy phlegon muse and testify how saturn sitting in an ebon cloud disrobed his podex white as ivory and through the welkin thunder'd all aloud
he is not for extempore sir he is all for the pocket muse please you command a sight of it
yes yes search him for a taste of his vein
they search mathew's pockets
you must not deny the queen's justice sir under a writ of rebellion
body me he carries a whole realm a commonwealth of paper in his hose let us see some of his subjects
unto the boundless ocean of thy face runs this poor river charg'd with streams of eyes
with a kind of miraculous gift to make it absurder than it was
is all the rest of this batch
bring me a torch lay it together and give fire
sets the papers on fire
here was enough to have infected the whole city if it had not been taken in time
see see how our poet's glory shines
o now it is at the highest and now it declines as fast
you may see sic transit gloria mundi
there's an emblem for you son and your studies
nay no speech or act of mine be drawn against such as profess it worthily
they are not born every year as an alderman
there goes more to the making of a good poet than a sheriff
master kitely you look upon me
though i live in the city here amongst you i will do more reverence to him when i meet him than i will to the mayor out of his year
but these paper pedlars
they cannot expect reprehension or reproach they have it with the fact know
sir you have saved me the labour of a defence
it shall be discourse for supper between your father and me if he dare undertake me
but to dispatch away these you sign the soldier and picture of the poet but both so false i will not have you hanged out at my door till midnight while we are at supper you two shall penitently fast it out in my court without and if you will you may pray there that we may be so merry within as to forgive or forget you when we come out
here's a third because we tender your safety shall watch you he is provided for the purpose
look to your charge sir
and what shall i do
i had lost a sheep an he had not bleated why sir you shall give master downright his cloak and i will intreat him to take it
a trencher and a napkin you shall have in the buttery and keep cob and his wife company here whom i will intreat first to be reconciled and you to endeavour with your wit to keep them so
i'll do my best
why now i see thou art honest tib i receive thee as my dear and mortal wife again
and i you as my loving and obedient husband
it will be their bridal night too
they are married anew
come i conjure the rest to put off all discontent
you master downright your anger you master knowell your cares master kitely and his wife their jealousy
for i must tell you both while that is fed horns in the mind are worse than on the head
sir thus they go from me kiss me sweetheart
see what a drove of horns fly in the air wing'd with my cleansed and my credulous breath
watch' em suspicious eyes watch where they fall
on heads that think they have none at all
o what a plenteous world of this will come
when air rains horns all may be sure of some
i have learn'd so much verse out of a jealous man's part in a play
'tis well 'tis well
this night we'll dedicate to friendship love and laughter
master bridegroom take your bride and lead every one a fellow
here is my mistress brainworm
to whom all my addresses of courtship shall have their reference whose adventures this day when our grandchildren shall hear to be made a fable i doubt not but it shall find both spectators and applause
