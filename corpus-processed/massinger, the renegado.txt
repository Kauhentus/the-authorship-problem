you haue hirde a shop then
yes sir and our wares though brittle as a maydenhead at ix∣teene are safe vnladen not a christall crackt or china dish needs sodring our choice pictures as they came from the workeman without blemish and i haue studied speeches for each pee and in a thrifty tone to sell 'em off will sweare by and that this is mistris to the great duke of florence that neece to old king pippin and a third an austrian princesse by her roman nose how ere my conscience tels me they are figures of bades and common courtezans in venice
you make no scruple of an oath then
ie sir tis out of my indentures i am bound there to sweare for my masters profit as securely as your intelligencer must for his prince that sendes him forth an honourable spie to serue his purposes
and if it be lawfull in a christian shopkeeper to cheate his father i cannot find but to abuse a turke in the sale of our commodities must bee thought a meritorious worke
i wonder sirra what's your religion
troth to answere truely i would not be of one that should command mee to feed vpon poore iohn when i see pheasants and partriges on the table nor doe i like the other that allowes vs to eate flesh in the lent though it be rotten rather then bee thought superstitious as your zealous cobler and learned botcher preach at amsterdam ouer a hotchpotch
i would not be cofin'd in my beliefe when all your sects ectries are growne of one opinion if i like it i will professe my selfe in the meane time liue i in england spaine france i am of that countryes aith vitel
and what in tunis will you turne turke heere
so i should loose a collop of that part my dll inoyn'd mee to bring home as she left it tis her venture nor dare i barter that commoditie without her speciall warant
you are a knae sir leaing your roguerie thinke vpon my businesse it is no time to foole now remember where you are too
though this mart time wee are allowde free trading and with safetie
temper your tongue and meddle not with the turkes their manners nor religion
take you heede sir what colours you weare
not two houres since there lan∣ded an english pirats whore with a greene apron and as she walk't the streets one of their mufties wee call them priests at venice with a razor cutts it of petticoate smocke and all and leaues her as naked as my nayle the young frie wondering what strange beast it should be
i scap't a scouring my mistres buskepoynt of that forbidden coloure then tyde my codpeece had it beene discouer'd i had beene caponde
and had beene well seru'd haste to the shoppe and set my wares in order i will not long be absent
though i striue sir to put of melencholy to which you are euer too much inclinde it shall not hinder me with my best care to serue you exit gazet
o wellcome sir stay of my steppes in this life and guide to all my blessed hopes heereafter
haue your indeauours posper'd
haue wee tirde fortunes malice with our sufferings
is she at length after so many frownes pleas'd to vouchafe one cheerefull looke vpon vs
you giue too much to fortune and your passions ore which a wise man if religious tryumphs
that name fooles worship and those tyrants which wee arme against our better part our reason may add but neuer take from our afflictions vitelli
sir as i am a sinfull man i can not but like one suffer
i exacte not from you a fortitude insensible of calamitie to which the saint's themselues haue bowde and showne they are made of flesh and bloud all that i challenge is manly patience
will you that vvere train'd vp in a religious schoole where diuine maximes scorning comparison vvith morall precepts were daily taught you beare your constancies triall not like vitelli but a village nurse with curses in your mouth teares in your eyes
hovv poorely it showes in you
i am school'd sir and will heereafter to my vtmost strength studie to bee my selfe
so shall you find mee most ready to assist you neither haue i slept in your greate occasions since i left you i haue beene at the viceroies court and presde as far as they allovve a christian entrance
and something i haue learn't that may concerne the purpose of this iourney
deere sir vvhat is it
by the command of asambeg the viceroy the cittie swels vvith barbarous pompe and pride for the entertainement of stout mustapha the basha of aleppo vvho in person comes to receiue the neece of amurah the fayre donusa for his bride
i find not hovv this may profit vs
pray you giue mee leaue
among the rest that vvayte vpon the viceroy such as haue vnder him command in tunis
who as you haue often heard are all false pirats i savv the shame of venice and the scorne of all good men the periurde renegado antono grimaldy vitel
his name is poyson to mee
i haue done sir
this debauchde villaine whom we euer thought after his impious scorne done in saint markes to me as i stood at the holy altar the theefe that rauish't your fayre sister from you the vertuous paulina not long since as i am truely giuen to vnderstand sold to the viceroy a fayre christian virgin on whom maugre his fierce and cruell nature asambeg dotes extreamely
tis my sister it must be shee my better angell tells me tis poore paulina
farewell all disguises ile show in my reuenge that i am noble
you are not mad
no sir my vertuous anger makes euery veyne an arterie i feele in mee the strength of twenty men and being arm'd with my good cause to wreake wrong'd innocence i dare alone run to the viceroys court and with this ponyard before his face
digge out grimaldies heart
would you haue me tame now can i know my sister mewde vp in his serragli and in danger not alone to loose her honour but her soule the hell breed villaine by too
that has sold both to blacke destruction and not haste to send him to the deuill his tutor
to be patient now were in another name to play the pandor to the viceroyes loose embraces and cry aime while he by force or flaterie compels her to yeeld her fayre name vp to his foule lust and after turne apostata to the faith that she was breed in
d'oe but giue me hearing
and you shall soone grant how ridiculous this childish fury is
a wise man neuer attempts impossibilities 'tis as easie for any single arme to quell an army
as to effect your wishes we come hither to learne paulinas faith and to redeeme her leaue your reuenge to heauen i oft haue tould you of a relique that i gaue her which has power if we may credit holy mens traditions to keepe the owner free from violence this on her breast she weares and does preserue the vertue of it by her daily prayers
so if she fall not by her owne consent which it were sinne to thinke i feare no force
be therefore patient keepe this borrowed shape till time and oportunitie present vs with some fit meanes to see her which perform'd ile ioyne with you in any desperate course for her deliuery
you haue charmde me sir and i obey in all things pray you pardon the weakenesse of my passion
be cheerefull man for know that good intents are in the end crownd with as fayre euents
haue you seene the christian captiue the great basha is so enamourd of
yes an't please your excellency i tooke a full view of her when shee vvas presented to him
and is she such a wonder as tis reported
she was drown'd in teares then which tooke much from her beautie yet in spite of sorrow shee appeard the mistresse of most rare perfections and though low of stature her well proportion'd limbes inuite affection and when she speakes each syllable is musique that does inchaunt the hearers
but your highnesse that are not to be parallelde i yet neuer beheld her equall
come you flatter me but i forgiue it we that are borne great seldome distast our seruants though they giue vs more then wee can pretend too
i haue heard that christian ladies liue with much more freedome then such as are borne heere
our iealous turkes neuer permit their aire wiues to be leene but at the publique bannias or the mosques and euen then vaylde and garded
thou carazie wert borne in england what's the cust me there among your women
come be free and merry i am no seuere mistres nor hat thou met with a heauie bondage
i was made lighter by two stone waight at least to be fit to erue you
but to your question madame women in england for the most part liue like queenes
your countrey ladies haue libertie to hauke to hunt to feast to giue free entertainement to all commers to talke to kisse there's no such thing knowne there as an italian girdle
your cittie dam without leaue weares the breeches has her husband at as much command as her prentice and if need be can make him cuckold by her fathers coppie
but your court lady
she i assure you madame knowes nothing but her will must be allovv'd her foot men her caroch her vshers her pages her doctor chaplines and as i haue heard they are growne of late so learn'd that they maintaine a strange position which their lords with all their witt cannot confute
what's that i prethee
marry that it is not onely fit but lavvfull your madame there her much rest and high feeding duely considered should to ease her husband bee allow'd a priuate frien
they haue drawne a bill to this good purpose and the next assembly doubt not to passe it
wee enioy no more that are of the othman race though our religio allovves all pleasure
i am dull some musicque take my chiapines off
so a lustie straie a galliard
mant tis the basha of aleppo who humbly makes request he may present his seruice to you

may those powers that rais'd the othoman empire and still gard it reward your highnesse for this gratious fauour you throwe vpon your seruant
it hath pleasde the most invincible mightiest amurath to speake his other titles would take from him that in himselfe does comprehend all greatnesse to make me the vnworthy instrument of his command
receiue diuinest lady deliuers a letter
this letter sign'd by his victorious hand and made authentic by the imperiall seale
there when you find me mention'd far be it from yo to thinke it my ambition to presume at such a happinesse which his povverfull will from his great minds magnificence not my merit hath showrd vpon mee
but if your consent ioyne with his good opinion and allovvance to perit vvhat his fauors haue begun i shall in my obsequiousnesse and dutie endeuour to preuent all iust complaints which want of will to serue you may call on mee
his sacred maiestie writes here that your valour against the persian hath so vvonne vpon him that there's no grace or honour in his guift of which he can imagine you nworthy
and what's the greatest you can hope or aime at it is his pleasure you should be receiu'd into his royall familie prouided forso far i am vnconfind that i affect and like your person
i expect not the ceremonie which he vses in bestowing of his daughters and his neeces
as that he should present you for my slaue to loue you if you pleasde me or deliuer a ponyarde on my least dislike to kill you
such tyranuie and pride agree not with my softer disposition
let it suffice for my first answer that thus far i grace you
giues him her hand to kisse ereafter some time spent to make enquire of the good parts and faculties of your mind you shall heare further from mee
though all torments really suffer'd or in hell imaginde by curious fiction in one houres delay are wholy comprehended i confesse that i stand bound in dutie not to checke at what euer you command or please to impose for triall of my patience

that you cloth me in this sad liuery of death assures me your sentence is gone out before and i to late am cald for in my guilty cause to vse qualification or excuse yet must i not part so with mine owne strengths but borrow from my modesty boldnesse to enquire by whose authority you sit my iudges and whose warrant digs my graue in the frownes you dart against my life
see heere this fatall signe and warrant this brought to a generall fighting in the head of his victorious troopes rauishes from his hand his eu'n then conquering sword this showne vnto the sultans brothers or his sonnes deliuers his deadly anger and all hopes lay'd by commands them to prepare themselues for heauen
which would stand with the quiet of your soule to thinke vpon and imitate
giue me leaue a little to complayne first of the hard condition of my ortune which may moue you though not to rise vp intercessors for me yet in remembrance of my former life this being the first pot tainting mine honor to be the meanes to bring me to his presence and thou i doubt not but i could alleage such reasons in mie owne defence or pleade so humbly my teares helpinge that it should awake his sleeping pitty
if you haue ought to say you shall haue hearing and in me thinke him preent
i would thus then first kneele and kisse his feete and after tell him how long i had beene his darling what delight my infant yeeres afforded him how deere hee prizde his sister in both bloods my mother that she like him had frailety that to me descends as an inheritance then coniure him by her blest ashes and his fathers soule the sword that rides vpon his thigh his right hand holding the scepter and the ottoman fortune to haue compassion on me
but suppose as i am sure he would be deafe what then could you inferre
i then would thus rise vp and to his teeth tell him he was a tyrant a most voluptuous and insatiable epicure in his owne pleasures which he hugs so deerely as proper and peculiar to himselfe that he denies a moderate lawfull vse of all delight to others
and to thee vnequall iudge i speake as much and charge thee but with impartiall eies to looke into thy selfe and then consider with what iustice thou canst pronounce my sentence

can feare to die make you descend so low from your high birth and brand the ottaman line with such a marke of infamy

by my order all roman caesars that ledde kings in chaines fast bound to their triumphant chariots if compar'd with that true glory and full luster you now appeare in all their boaste honors purchas'd with blood and wrong would loose their names and be no more remembred

this christian feares not it seemes the neere approching sun whose second rise he neuer must salute
with the bak't meat
heere's the viceroyes ring giues warrant to my entrance yet you may partake of any thing i shall deliuer tis but a present to a dying man sent from the princesse that must suffer with him
vse your owne freedome

he has restor'd all and i at peace againe with my paulina
sir the sad donusa grieued for your sufferings more then for her owne knowing the long and tedious pilgrimage you are to take presents you with this cordiall which priuately she wishes you should taste of and search the middle part where you shall find something that hath the operation to make death looke louely
i will not dispute what she commands but serue it
