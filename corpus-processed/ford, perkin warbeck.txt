studies have of this nature been of late so out of fashion so unfollowed that it is become more justice to revive the antic follies of the times then strive to countenance wise industry no want of art doth render wit or lame or scant or slothful in the purchase of fresh bays; but want of truth in them who give the praise to their self love presuming to outdo the writer or for need the actors too
but such this author’s silence best befits who bids them be in love with their own wits from him to clearer judgements we can say he shews a history couched in a play a history of noble mention known famous and true most noble ’cause our own not forged from italy from france from spain but chronicled at home; as rich in strain of brave attempts as ever fertile rage in action could beget to grace the stage
we cannot limit scenes for the whole land itself appeared too narrow to withstand competitors for kingdoms nor is here unnecessary mirth forced to endear a multitude; on these two rests the fate of worthy expectation and westminster the royal presence chamber
enter king henry supported to the throne by the bishop of durham and sir william stanley earls of oxford and surrey and lord dawbney
still to be haunted still to be pursued still to be frighted with false apparitions of pageant majesty and new coined greatness as if we were a mockery king in state only ordained to lavish sweat and blood in scorn and laughter to the ghosts of york is all below our merits yet my lords my friends and counsellors yet we sit fast in our own royal birthright the rent face and bleeding wounds of england's slaughtered people have been by us as by the best physician at last both throughly cured and set in safety and yet for all this glorious work of peace ourselves is scarce secure
the rage of malice conjures fresh spirits with the spells of york
for ninety years ten english kings and princes threescore great dukes and earls a thousand lords and valiant knights two hundred fifty thousand of english subjects have in civil wars been sacrificed to an uncivil thirst of discord and ambition this hot vengeance of the just powers above to utter ruin and desolation had reigned on but that mercy did gently sheathe the sword of justice in lending to this blood shrunk commonwealth a new soul new birth in your sacred person
edward the fourth after a doubtful fortune yielded to nature leaving to his sons edward and richard the inheritance of a most bloody purchase these young princes richard the tyrant their unnatural uncle forced to a violent grave − so just is heaven him hath your majesty by your own arm divinely strengthened pulled from his boar's sty and struck the black usurper to a carcass
nor doth the house of york decay in honours though lancaster doth repossess his right for edward's daughter is king henry's queen − a blessèd union and a lasting blessing for this poor panting island if some shreds some useless remnant of the house of york grudge not at this content
margaret of burgundy blows fresh coals of division
painted fires without or heat to scorch or light to cherish
york's headless trunk her father edward's fate her brother king the smothering of her nephews by tyrant gloster brother to her nature nor gloster's own confusion − all decrees sacred in heaven − can move this woman monster but that she still from the unbottomed mine of devilish policies doth vent the ore of troubles and sedition
in her age − great sir observe the wonder − she grows fruitful who in her strength of youth was always barren nor are her births as other mothers' are at nine or ten months' end she has been with child eight or seven years at least; whose twins being born − a prodigy in nature − even the youngest is fifteen years of age at his first entrance as soon as known ith world tall striplings strong and able to give battle unto kings idols of yorkish malice
and but idols a steely hammer crushes 'em to pieces
lambert the eldest lords is in our service preferred by an officious care of duty from the scullery to a falconer − strange example
− which shews the difference between noble natures and the base born but for the upstart duke the new revived york edward's second son murdered long since ith tower − he lives again and vows to be your king
the throne is filled sir
true stanley and the lawful heir sits on it a guard of angels and the holy prayers of loyal subjects are a sure defence against all force and counsel of intrusion
− but now my lords put case some of our nobles our great ones should give countenance and courage to trim duke perkin you will all confess our bounties have unthriftily been scattered amongst unthankful men
unthankful beasts dogs villains traitors
dawbney let the guilty keep silence i accuse none though i know foreign attempts against a state and kingdom are seldom without some great friends at home
sir if no other abler reasons else of duty or allegiance could divert a headstrong resolution yet the dangers so lately passed by men of blood and fortunes in lambert simnel's party must command more than a fear a terror to conspiracy
the high born lincoln son to de la pole the earl of kildare the lord geraldine francis lord lovell and the german baron bold martin swart with broughton and the rest − most spectacles of ruin some of mercy − are precedents sufficient to forewarn the present times or any that live in them what folly nay what madness 'twere to lift a finger up in all defence but yours which can be but imposturous in a title
stanley we know thou lov'st us and thy heart is figured on thy tongue nor think we less of any's here
− how closely we have hunted this cub since he unlodged from hole to hole your knowledge is our chronicle first ireland the common stage of novelty presented this gewgaw to oppose us there the geraldines and butlers once again stood in support of this colossic statue charles of france thence called him into his protectiön dissembled him the lawful heir of england yet this was all but french dissimulation aiming at peace with us which being granted on honourable terms on our part suddenly this smoke of straw was packed from france again infect some grosser air and now we learn − maugre the malice of the bastard nevill sir taylor and a hundred english rebels − they're all retired to flanders to the dam that nursed this eager whelp margaret of burgundy
but we will hunt him there too we will hunt him
hunt him to death even in the beldam's closet though the archduke were his buckler
she has styled him the fair white rose of england

enter urswick with a paper
gracious sovereign please you peruse this paper
the king's countenance gathers a sprightly blood
good news believe it
enough − is barley come too
no matter − phew
he's but a running weed at pleasure to be plucked up by the roots but more of this anon
− i have bethought me my lords for reasons which you shall pertake it is our pleasure to remove our court from westminster to th' tower we will lodge this very night there; − to stanley give lord chamberlain a present order for 't

an apartment in the earl of huntley's house
enter earl of huntley and lord dalyell
you trifle time sir
o my noble lord you conster my griefs to so hard a sense that where the text is argument of pity matter of earnest love your gloss corrupts it with too much ill placed mirth
much mirth lord dalyell
not so i vow
observe me sprightly gallant
i know thou art a noble lad a handsome descended from an honourable ancestry forward and active dost resolve to wrestle and ruffle in the world by noble actions for a brave mention to posterity i scorn not thy affection to my daughter not i by good saint andrew but this bugbear this whoreson tale of honour − honour dalyell
− so hourly chats and tattles in mine ear the piece of royalty that is stitched up in my kate's blood that 'tis as dangerous for thee young lord to perch so near an eaglet as foolish for my gravity to admit it i have spoke all at once
sir with this truth you mix such wormwood that you leave no hope for my disordered palate e'er to relish a wholesome taste again alas i know sir what an unequal distance lies between great huntley's daughter's birth and dalyell's fortunes she's the king's kinswoman placed near the crown a princess of the blood and i a subject
right but a noble subject put in that too
i could add more and in the rightest line derive my pedigree from adam mure a scottish knight whose daughter was the mother to him who first begot the race of jameses that sway the sceptre to this very day
but kindreds are not ours when once the date of many years have swallowed up the memory of their originals so pasture fields neighbouring too near the ocean are sooped up and known no more for stood i in my first and native greatness if my princely mistress vouchsafed me not her servant 'twere as good i were reduced to clownery to nothing as to a throne of wonder
aside now by saint andrew a spark of mettle
'a has a brave fire in him i would 'a had my daughter so i knew't not
but must not be so must not
− well young lord this will not do yet if the girl be headstrong and will not hearken to good counsel steal her and run away with her dance galliards do and frisk about the world to learn the languages 'twill be a thriving trade you may set up by't
with pardon noble gordon this disdain suits not your daughter's virtue or my constancy
− aside would he would beat me i deserve it
− dalyell thy hand w'are friends follow thy courtship take thine own time and speak if thou prevail'st with passion more than i can with my counsel she's thine nay she is thine 'tis a fair match free and allowed
i'll only use my tongue without a father's power use thou thine self do self have no more words win and wear her
you bless me i am now too poor in thanks to pay the debt i owe you
nay th'art poor enough
− aside i love his spirit infinitely
− look ye she comes to her now to her to her
enter lady katherine and jane
to huntley the king commands your presence sir
the gallant − this this this lord this servant kate of yours desires to be your master
i acknowledge him a worthy friend of mine
the game's a foot i'm in cold hunting the hare and hounds are parties
princely lady how most unworthy i am to employ my services in honour of your virtues how hopeless my desires are to enjoy your fair opinion and much more your love − are only matter of despair unless your goodness give large warrant to my boldness my feeble winged ambition
aside this is scurvy
my lord i interrupt you not
now on my life she'll court him
− nay nay on sir
oft have i tuned the lesson of my sorrows to sweeten discord and enrich your pity but all in vain here had my comforts sunk and never ris'n again to tell a story of the despairing lover had not now even now the earl your father − hunt
aside he means me sure
after some fit disputes of your condition your highness and my lowness giv'n a license which did not more embolden than encourage my faulting tongue
" i "encourage" ye
− a subtle trick a quaint one − will you hear man
what did i say to you
come come toth point
it shall not need my lord
then hear me kate
− keep you on that hand of her i on this
− to katherine thou stand'st between a father and a suitor both striving for an interest in thy heart he courts thee for affection i for duty he as a servant pleads but by the privilege of nature though i might command my care shall only counsel what it shall not force
thou canst but make one choice the ties of marriage are tenures not at will but during life
consider whose thou art and who a princess a princess of the royal blood of scotland in the full spring of youth and fresh in beauty
the king that sits upon the throne is young and yet unmarried forward in attempts on any least occasion to endanger his person wherefore kate as i am confident thou dar'st not wrong thy birth and education by yielding to a common servile rage of female wantonness so i am confident thou wilt proportion all thy thoughts to side thy equals if not equal thy superiors
my lord of dalyell young in years is old in honours but nor eminent in titles or in estate that may support or add to the expectation of thy fortunes
settle thy will and reason by a strength of judgment for in a word i give thee freedom take it
if equal fates have not ordained to pitch thy hopes above my height let not thy passion lead thee to shrink mine honour in oblivion thou art thine own i have done
o y'are all oracle the living stock and root of truth and wisdom
my worthiest lord and father the indulgence of your sweet composition thus commands the lowest of obedience you have granted a liberty so large that i want skill to choose without direction of example from which i daily learn by how much more you take off from the roughness of a father by so much more i am engaged to tender the duty of a daughter
for respects of birth degrees of title and advancement i nor admire nor slight them all my studies shall ever aim at this perfection only to live and die so that you may not blush in any course of mine to own me yours
kate kate thou grow'st upon my heart like peace creating every other hour a jubilee
to you my lord of dalyell i address some few remaining words the general fame that speaks your merit even in vulgar tongues proclaims it clear but in the best a precedent
good wench good girl y' faith
for my part trust me i value mine own worth at higher rate cause you are pleased to prize it if the stream of your protested service − as you term it − run in a constancy more than a compliment it shall be my delight that worthy love leads you to worthy actions and these guide ye richly to wed an honourable name so every virtuous praise in after ages shall be your heir and i in your brave mention be chronicled the mother of that issue that glorious issue
o that i were young again
she'd make me court proud danger and suck spirit from reputation
to the present motion here's all that i dare answer when a ripeness of more experience and some use of time resolves to treat the freedom of my youth upon exchange of troths i shall desire no surer credit of a match with virtue than such as lives in you mean time my hopes are preserved secure in having you a friend
you are a blessèd lady and instruct ambition not to soar a farther flight than in the perfumed air of your soft voice
− my noble lord of huntley you have lent a full extent of bounty to this parley and for it shall command your humblest servant
enough we are still friends and will continue a hearty love
− o kate thou art mine own
− no more − my lord of crawford
enter earl of crawford
from the king i come my lord of huntley who in council requires your present aid
a secretary from a duke of york the second son to the late english edward concealed i know not where these fourteen years craves audience from our master and 'tis said the duke himself is following to the court
duke upon duke 'tis well 'tis well here's bustling for majesty
− my lord i will along with ye
my service noble lady
please ye walk sir
aside "times have their changes sorrow makes men wise the sun itself must set as well as rise" then why not − fair madam i wait on ye
an apartment in the tower
enter the bishop of durham sir robert clifford and urswick
you find sir robert clifford how securely king henry our great master doth commit his person to your loyalty you taste his bounty and his mercy even in this that at a time of night so late a place so private as his closet he is pleased admit you to his favour
do not falter in your discovery but as you covet a liberal grace and pardon for your follies so labour to deserve it by laying open all plots all persons that contrive against it
remember not the witchcraft or the magic the charms and incantations which the sorceress of burgundy hath cast upon your reason sir robert be your own friend now discharge your conscience freely all of such as love you stand sureties for your honesty and truth
take heed you do not dally with the king he's wise as he is gentle
i am miserable if henry be not merciful
kneels let my weak knees rot on the earth if i appear as leperous in my treacheries before your royal eyes as to mine own i seem a monster by my breach of truth
clifford stand up for instance of thy safety i offer thee my hand
a sovereign balm for my bruised soul i kiss it with a greediness
kisses the king's hand and rises
sir you're a just master but i − hen
tell me is every circumstance thou hast set down with thine own hand within this paper true
is it a sure intelligence of all the progress of our enemies' intents without corruption
true as i wish heaven or my infected honour white again
we know all clifford fully since this meteor this airy apparition first discradled from tournay into portugal and thence advanced his fiery blaze for adoration toth superstitious irish since the beard of this wild comet conjured into france sparkled in antic flames in charles his court but shrunk again from thence and hid in darkness stole into flanders flourishing the rags of painted power on the shore of kent whence he was beaten back with shame and scorn contempt and slaughter of some naked outlaws but tell me what new course now shapes duke perkin
for ireland mighty henry so instructed by stephen frion sometimes secretary in the french tongue unto your sacred excellence but perkin's tutor now
a subtle villain that frion frion − you my lord of durham knew well the man
french both in heart and actions
some irish heads work in this mine of treason speak 'em
not any of the best your fortune hath dulled their spleens
never had counterfeit such a confusèd rabble of lost bankrouts for counsellors first heron a broken mercer then john a water sometimes mayor of cork sketon a tailor and a scrivener called astley and whate'er these list to treat of perkin must hearken to but frion cunning above these dull capacities still prompts him to fly to scotland to young james the fourth and sue for aid to him this is the latest of all their resolutions
pestilent adder he will hiss out poison as dangerous as infectious we must match 'em
− clifford thou hast spoke home we give thee life but clifford there are people of our own remain behind untold who are they clifford
name those and we are friends and will to rest 'tis thy last task
o sir here i must break a most unlawful oath to keep a just one
well well be brief be brief
the first in rank shall be john ratcliffe lord fitzwater then sir simon mountford and sir thomas thwaites with william dawbeney chessoner astwood worseley the dean of paul's two other friars and robert ratcliffe
churchmen are turned devils
− these are the principal
one more remains unnamed whom i could willingly forget
great sir do not hear him for when sir william stanley your lord chamberlain shall come into the list as he is chief i shall lose credit with ye yet this lord last named is first against you
− view well my face sirs is there blood left in it
you alter strangely sir
why clifford stabbed me or i dreamed 'a stabbed me
− to clifford sirrah it is a custom with the guilty to think they set their own stains oft by laying aspersions on some nobler than themselves lies wait on treasons as i find it here
thy life again is forfeit i recall my word of mercy for i know thou dar'st repeat the name no more
i dare and once more upon my knowledge name sir william stanley both in his counsel and his purse the chief assistant to the feignèd duke of york
yet again once more
sir william stanley is your secret enemy and if time fit will openly profess it
my chamberlain my counsellor the love the pleasure of my court my bosom friend the charge and the controlment of my person the keys and secrets of my treasury the all of all i am
misery of confidence − let me turn traitor to mine own person yield my sceptre up to edward's sister and her bastard duke
you lose your constant temper
− oh do not blame me he 'twas only he who having rescued me in bosworth field from richard's bloody sword snatched from his head the kingly crown and placed it first on mine
he never failed me what have i deserved to lose this good man's heart or he his own
the night doth waste this passion ill becomes ye provide against your danger
let it be so
urswick command straight stanley to his chamber; − 'tis well we are ith tower; − set a guard on him
− clifford to bed you must lodge here to night we'll talk with you to morrow
− my sad soul divines strange troubles
the king the king
i must have entrance
dawbney's voice admit him
what new combustions huddle next to keep our eyes from rest
ten thousand cornish grudging to pay your subsidies have gathered a head led by a blacksmith and a lawyer they make for london and to them is joined lord audley as they march their number daily increases; they are − hen
− talk no more; such are not worthy of my thoughts to night and if i cannot sleep i'll wake
when counsels fail and there's in man no trust even then an arm from heaven fights for the just
the presence chamber in the palace
enter above the countess of crawford lady katherine jane and other ladies
countess of come ladies here's a solemn preparation for entertainment of this english prince the king intends grace more than ordinary 'twere pity now if he should prove a counterfeit
bless the young man our nation would be laughed at for honest souls through christendom
my father hath a weak stomach to the business madam but that the king must not be crossed
countess of brings a goodly troop they say of gallants with him but very modest people for they strive not to fame their names too much their godfathers may be beholding to them but their fathers scarce owe them thanks they are disguisèd princes brought up it seems to honest trades no matter they will break forth in season
or break out for most of 'em are broken by report
let us observe 'em and be silent
enter king james earls of huntley and crawford lord dalyell and other noblemen
the right of kings my lords extends not only to the safe conservation of their own but also to the aid of such allíes as change of time and state hath oftentimes hurled down from careful crowns to undergo an exercise of sufferance in both fortunes so english richard surnamed coeur de lion so robert bruce our royal ancestor forced by the trial of the wrongs they felt both sought and found supplies from foreign kings to repossess their own
then grudge not lords a much distressèd prince king charles of france and maximilian of bohemia both have ratified his credit by their letters shall we then be distrustful
no compassion is one rich jewël that shines in our crown and we will have it shine there
do your will sir
the young duke is at hand dalyell from us first greet him and conduct him on then crawford shall meet him next and huntley last of all present him to our arms
− exit lord dalyell
sound sprightly music whilst majesty encounters majesty
re enter lord dalyell with perkin warbeck followed at a distance by frion heron sketon astley and john a water
the earl of crawford advances and entertains perkin at the door the earl of huntley next salutes him and presents him to the king they embrace the noblemen slightly salute his followers
most high most mighty king
that now there stands before your eyes in presence of your peers a subject of the rarest kind of pity that hath in any age touched noble hearts the vulgar story of a prince's ruin hath made it too apparent europe knows and all the western world what persecution hath raged in malice against us sole heir to the great throne of old plantagenets
how from our nursery we have been hurried unto the sanctuary from the sanctuary forced to the prison from the prison haled by cruël hands to the tormentor's fury is registered already in the volume of all men's tongues whose true relation draws compassion melted into weeping eyes and bleeding souls but our misfortunes since have ranged a larger progress through strange lands protected in our innocence by heaven
edward the fifth our brother in his tragedy quenched their hot thirst of blood whose hire to murther paid them their wages of despair and horror the softness of my childhood smiled upon the roughness of their task and robbed them farther of hearts to dare or hands to execute
great king they spared my life the butchers spared it returned the tyrant my unnatural uncle a truth of my dispatch i was conveyed with secrecy and speed to tournay fostered by obscure means taught to unlearn myself but as i grew in years i grew in sense of fear and of disdain fear of the tyrant whose power swayed the throne then when disdain of living so unknown in such a servile and abject lowness prompted me to thoughts of recollecting who i was i shook off my bondage and made haste to let my aunt of burgundy acknowledge me her kinsman heir to the crown of england snatched by henry from richard's head a thing scarce known ith world
my lord it stands not with your counsel now to fly upon invectives if you can make this apparent what you have discoursed in every circumstance we will not study an answer but are ready in your cause
you are a wise and just king by the powers above reserved beyond all other aids to plant me in mine own inheritance to marry these two kingdoms in a love never to be divorced while time is time
as for the manner first of my escape of my conveyance next of my life since the means and persons who were instruments great sir 'tis fit i over pass in silence reserving the relation to the secrecy of your own princely ear since it concerns some great ones living yet and others dead whose issue might be questioned
for your bounty royal magnificence to him that seeks it we vow hereafter to demean ourself as if we were your own and natural brother omitting no occasion in our person express a gratitude beyond example
he must be more than subject who can utter the language of a king and such is thine
take this for answer be what'er thou art thou never shalt repent that thou hast put thy cause and person into my protection
cousin of york thus once more we embrace thee welcome to james of scotland
for thy safety know such as love thee not shall never wrong thee
come we will taste a while our court delights dream hence affliction past and then proceed to high attempts of honour
− both thou and thine are ours and we will guard ye
exeunt all but the ladies above
countess of i have not seen a gentleman of a more brave aspéct or goodlier carriage his fortunes move not him
− to katherine madam you're passionate
beshrew me but his words have touched me home as if his cause concerned me i should pity him if he should prove another than he seems
re enter earl of crawford
ladies the king commands your presence instantly for entertainment of the duke
the duke must then be entertained the king obeyed it is our duty
countess of we will all wait on him
enter king henry the earls of oxford and surrey and the bishop of durham
have ye condemned my chamberlain
his treasons condemned him sir which were as clear and manifest as foul and dangerous besides the guilt of his conspiracy pressed him so nearly that it drew from him free confessiön without an importunity
o lord bishop this argued shame and sorrow for his folly and must not stand in evidence against our mercy and the softness of our nature the rigour and extremity of law is sometimes too too bitter but we carry a chancery of pity in our bosom
i hope we may reprieve him from the sentence of death i hope we may
you may you may and so persuade your subjects that the title of york is better nay more just and lawful than yours of lancaster
so stanley holds which if it be not treason in the highest then we are traitors all perjured and false who have took oath to henry and the justice of henry's title oxford surrey dawbney with all your other peers of state and church forsworn and stanley true alone to heaven and england's lawful heir
by vere's old honours i'll cut his throat dares speak it
'tis a quarrel engage a soul in
what a coil is here to keep my gratitude sincere and perfect
stanley was once my friend and came in time to save my life; − yet to say truth my lords the man stayed long enough t' endanger it − but i could see no more into his heart than what his outward actions did present and for 'em have rewarded him so fully as that there wanted nothing in our gift to gratify his merit as i thought unless i should divide my crown with him and give him half though now i well perceive 'twould scarce have served his turn without the whole
− but i am charitable lords let justice proceed in execution whiles i mourn the loss of one whom i esteemed a friend
sir he is coming this way
if he speak to me i could deny him nothing to prevent it i must withdraw
pray lords commend my favours to his last peace which i with him will pray for that done it doth concern us to consult of other following troubles
i am glad he's gone upon my life he would have pardoned the traitor had he seen him
'tis a king composed of gentleness
rare and unheard of but every man is nearest to himself and that the king observes 'tis fit he should
enter sir william stanley executioner confessor urswick and lord dawbney
may i not speak with clifford ere i shake this piece of frailty off
you shall he's sent for
i must not see the king
from him sir william these lords and i am sent he bad us say that he commends his mercy to your thoughts wishing the laws of england could remit the forfeit of your life as willingly as he would in the sweetness of his nature forget your trespass but howe'er your body fall into dust he vows the king himself doth vow to keep a requiem for your soul as for a friend close treasured in his bosom
without remembrance of your errors past i come to take my leave and wish you heaven
and i good angels guard ye
o the king next to my soul shall be the nearest subject of my last prayers
− my grave lord of durham my lords of oxford surrey dawbney all accept from a poor dying man a farewell
i was as you are once − great and stood hopeful of many flourishing years but fate and time have wheeled about to turn me into nothing
sir robert clifford comes − the man sir william you so desire to speak with
enter sir robert clifford
sir william stanley i am glad your conscience before your end hath emptied every burthen which charged it as that you can clearly witness how far i have proceeded in a duty that both concerned my truth and the state's safety
mercy how dear is life to such as hug it
− come hether by this token think on me
makes a cross on clifford's face with his finger
i wet upon your cheeks a holy sign − the cross the christian's badge the traitor's infamy wear clifford to thy grave this painted emblem water shall never wash it off all eyes that gaze upon thy face shall read there written a state informer's character more ugly stamped on a noble name than on a base
the heavens forgive thee
− pray my lords no change of words this man and i have used too many
shall i be disgraced without reply
give losers leave to talk his loss is irrecoverable
once more to all a long farewell
the best of greatness preserve the king
my next suit is my lords to be remembered to my noble brother derby my much grieved brother oh persuade him that i shall stand no blemish to his house in chronicles writ in another age
my heart doth bleed for him and for his sighs tell him he must not think the style of derby nor being husband to king henry's mother the league with peers the smiles of fortune can secure his peace above the state of man
i take my leave to travel to my dust "subjects deserve their deaths whose kings are just
" − come cónfessor
− on with thy axe friend on
he is led off to execution
was i called hither by a traitor's breath to be upbraided
lords the king shall know it
re enter king henry with a white staff
the king doth know it sir the king hath heard what he or you could say
we have given credit to every point of clifford's information the only evidence 'gainst stanley's head dies for't are you pleased
i pleased my lord
no echoes for your service we dismiss your more attendance on the court take ease and live at home but as you love your life stir not from london without leave from us
we'll think on your reward away
die all our griefs with stanley
take this staff of office dawbney henceforth be our chamberlain
i am your humblest servant
we are followed by enemies at home that will not cease to seek their own confusion 'tis most true the cornish under audley are marched on as far as winchester; − but let them come our forces are in readiness we'll catch 'em in their own toils
your army being mustered consists in all of horse and foot at least in number six and twenty thousand men daring and able resolute to fight and loyal in their truths
we know it dawbney for them we order thus oxford in chief assisted by bold essex and the earl of suffolk shall lead on the first battalia be that your charge
i humbly thank your majesty
the next division we assign to dawbney these must be men of action for on those the fortune of our fortunes must rely
the last and main ourself commands in person as ready to restore the fight at all times as to consummate an assured victory
the king is still oraculous
but surrey we have employment of more toil for thee for our intelligence comes swiftly to us that james of scotland late hath entertained perkin the counterfeit with more than common grace and respect nay courts him with rare favours
the scot is young and forward we must look for a sudden storm to england from the north which to withstand durham shall post to norham to fortify the castle and secure the frontiers against an invasion there
surrey shall follow soon with such an army as may relieve the bishop and encounter on all occasions the death daring scots
you know your charges all 'tis now a time to execute not talk heaven is our guard still
war must breed peace such is the fate of kings
an apartment in the palace
enter earl of crawford and lord dalyell
'tis more than strange my reason cannot answer such argument of fine imposture couched in witchcraft of persuasion that it fashions impossibilities as if appearance could cozen truth itself this dukeling mushroom hath doubtless charmed the king
courts the ladies as if his strength of language chained attention by power of prerogative
it madded my very soul to hear our master's motion what surety both of amity and honour must of necessity ensue upon a match betwixt some noble of our nation and this brave prince forsooth
'twill prove too fatal wise huntley fears the threatening
bless the lady from such a ruin
how the counsel privy of this young phaëthon do screw their faces into a gravity their trades good people were never guilty of
the meanest of 'em dreams of at least an office in the state
sure not the hangman's 'tis bespoke already for service to their rogueships − silence
enter king james and earl of huntley
do not argue against our will we have descended somewhat − as we may term it − too familiarly from justice of our birthright to examine the force of your allegiance − sir we have − but find it short of duty
break my heart do do king
have my services my loyalty − heaven knows untainted ever − drawn upon me contempt now in mine age when i but wanted a minute of a peace not to be troubled my last my long one
let me be a dotard a bedlam a poor sot or what you please to have me so you will not stain your blood your own blood royal sir though mixed with mine by marriage of this girl to a straggler take take my head sir whilst my tongue can wag it cannot name him other
kings are counterfeits in your repute grave oracle not presently set on their thrones with sceptres in their fists
but use your own detraction 'tis our pleasure to give our cousin york for wife our kinswoman the lady katherine instinct of sovereignty designs the honour though her peevish father usurps our resolution
o 'tis well exceeding well
i never was ambitious of using congees to my daughter queen − a queen
− forgive me dalyell thou honourable gentleman; − none here dare speak one word of comfort
the lady gracious prince maybe hath settled affection on some former choice
enforcement would prove but tyranny
i thank 'ee heartily
− let any yeoman of our nation challenge an interest in the girl then the king may add a jointure of ascent in titles worthy a free consent now 'a pulls down what old desert hath builded
i violate no pawns of faith intrude not on private loves that i have played the orator for kingly york to virtuous kate her grant can justify referring her contents to our provision
the welsh harry henceforth shall therefore know and tremble to acknowledge that not the painted idol of his policy shall fright the lawful owner from a kingdom

i am huntley old alexander gordon a plain subject nor more nor less and lady if you wish for a blessing you must bend your knees to heaven for heaven did give me you

exeunt all but frion heron sketon john a water and astley
now worthy gentlemen have i not followed my undertakings with success
here's entrance into a certainty above a hope
hopes are but hopes i was ever confident when i traded but in remnants that my stars had reserved me to the title of a viscount at least honour is honour though cut out of any stuffs
my brother heron hath right wisely delivered his opinion for he that threads his needle with the sharp eyes of industry shall in time go through stitch with the new suit of preferment
spoken to the purpose my fine witted brother sketon for as no indenture but has its counterpawne no noverint but his condition or defeasance so no right but may have claim no claim but may have possession any act of parliament to the contrary notwithstanding
you are all read in mysteries of state and quick of apprehension deep in judgment active in resolution and 'tis pity such counsel should lie buried in obscurity

believe it sir as english richard prospers you must not miss employment of high nature
if men may be credited in their mortality which i dare not peremptorily aver but they may or not be presumptions by this marriage are then in sooth of fruitful expectation
or else i must not justify other men's belief more than other should rely on mine
those that have borne office weigh every word before it can drop from them
but noble counsellors since now the present requires in point of honour − pray mistake not − some service to our lord 'tis fit the scots should not engross all glory to themselves at this so grand and eminent solemnity
the motion is defied i had rather for my part without trial of my country suffer persecution under the pressing iron of reproach or let my skin be punched full of eyelet holes with the bodkin of derision
i will sooner lose both my ears on the pillory of forgery
let me first live a bankrout and die in the lousy hole of hunger without compounding for sixpence in the pound
if men fail not in their expectations there may be spirits also that disgest no rude affronts master secretary frion or i am cozened which is possible i grant
resolved like men of knowledge at this feast then in honour of the bride the scots i know will in some show some masque or some device prefer their duties now it were uncomely that we be found less forward for our prince than they are for their lady and by how much we outshine them in persons of account by so much more will our endeavours meet with a livelier applause
great emperors have for their recreations undertook such kind of pastimes as for the conceit refer it to my study the performance you all shall share a thanks in 'twill be grateful
the motion is allowed i have stole to a dancing school when i was a prentice
there have been irish hubbubs when i have made one too
for fashioning of shapes and cutting a cross caper turn me off to my trade again
surely there is if i be not deceived a kind of gravity in merriment as there is or perhaps ought to be respect of persons in the quality of carriage which is as it is construed either so or so
still you come home to me upon occasion i find you relish courtship with discretion and such are fit for statesmen of your merits
pray 'e wait the prince and in his ear acquaint him with this design i'll follow and direct 'ee

rage shall not fright the bosom of our confidence in kent our cornish rebels cozened of their hopes met brave resistance by that country's earl george abergeny cobham poynings guilford and other loyal hearts now if blackheath must be reserved the fatal tomb to swallow such stiff necked abjects as with weary marches have travelled from their homes their wives and children to pay instead of subsidies their lives we may continue sovereign

briefly thus the cornish under audley disappointed of flattered expectation from the kentish − your majesty's right trusty liegemen − flew feathered by rage and heartened by presumption to take the field even at your palace gates and face you in your chamber royal arrogance improved their ignorance for they supposing misled by rumour that the day of battle should fall on monday rather braved your forces than doubted any onset yet this morning when in the dawning i by your direction strove to get deptford strand bridge there i found such a resistance as might shew what strength could make here arrows hailed in showers upon us a full yard long at least but we prevailed
my lord of oxford with his fellow peers environing the hill fell fiercely on them on the one side i on the other till great sir − pardon the oversight − eager of doing some memorable act i was engaged almost a prisoner but was freed as soon as sensible of danger now the fight began in heat which quenchèd in the blood of two thousand rebels and as many more reserved to try your mercy have returned a victory with safety

in the total scarcely four hundred
audley flammock joseph the ringleaders of this commotiön railed in ropes fit ornaments for traitors wait your determinations

let such as are escaped steal to the country back without pursuit there's not a drop of blood spilt but hath drawn as much of mine their swords could have wrought wonders on their king's part who faintly were unsheathed against their prince but wounded their own breasts

the feasts the manly stomachs the healths in usquebaugh and bonny clabber the ale in dishes never fetched from china the hundred thousand knacks not to be spoken of − and all this for king oberon and queen mab − should put a soul int 'ee
look 'ee good man how youthful i am grown but by your leave this new queen bride must henceforth be no more my daughter no burlady 'tis unfit and yet you see how i do bear this change methinks courageously then shake off care in such a time of jollity
alas sir how can you cast a mist upon your griefs
which howsoe'er you shadow but present to any judging eye the perfect substance of which mine are but counterfeits
thou interrupt'st the part i bear in music to this rare bridal feast let us be merry whilst flattering calms secure us against storms tempests when they begin to roar put out the light of peace and cloud the sun's bright eye in darkness of despair yet we are safe
i wish you could as easily forget the justice of your sorrows as my hopes can yield to destiny
then i see thou dost not know the flexible condition of my apt nature i can laugh laugh heartily when the gout cramps my joints let but the stone stop in my bladder i am straight a singing the quartan fever shrinking every limb sets me a capering straight do but betray me and bind me a friend ever what
i trust the losing of a daughter though i doted on every hair that grew to trim her head admits not any pain like one of these
come th'art deceived in me give me a blow a sound blow on the face i'll thank thee for't i love my wrongs still th'art deceived in me
o noble huntley my few years have learnt experience of too ripe an age to forfeit fit credulity forgive my rudeness i am bold
forgive me first a madness of ambition by example teach me humility for patience scorns lectures which schoolmen use to read to boys uncapable of injuries though old i could grow tough in fury and disclaim allegiance to my king could fall at odds with all my fellow peers that durst not stand defendants 'gainst the rape done on mine honour but kings are earthly gods there is no meddling with their anointed bodies for their actions they only are accountable to heaven
yet in the puzzle of my troubled brain one antidote's reserved against the poison of my distractions 'tis in thee t' apply it
name it o name it quickly sir
a pardon for my most foolish slighting thy deserts i have culled out this time to beg it preethee be gentle had i been so thou hadst owned a happy bride but now a castaway and never child of mine more
say not so sir it is not fault in her
the world would prate how she was handsome young i know she was tender and sweet in her obedience but lost now what a bankrupt am i made of a full stock of blessings

cousin of york you and your princely bride have liberally enjoyed such soft delights as a new married couple could forethink nor has our bounty shortened expectation but after all those pleasures of repose of amorous safety we must rouse the ease of dalliance with achievements of more glory than sloath and sleep can furnish yet for farewell gladly we entertain a truce with time to grace the joint endeavours of our servants
my royal cousin in your princely favour the extent of bounty hath been so unlimited as only an acknowledgment in words would breed suspicion in our state and quality
when we shall in the fulness of our fate − whose minister necessity will pérfit − sit on our own throne then our arms laid open to gratitude in sacred memory of these large benefits shall twine them close even to our thoughts and heart without distinction
then james and richard being in effect one person shall unite and rule one people divisible in titles only

it shall be done sir
now dearest ere sweet sleep shall seal those eyes love's precious tapers give me leave to use a parting ceremony for to morrow it would be sacrilege to intrude upon the temple of thy peace swift as the morning must i break from the down of thy embraces to put on steel and trace the paths which lead through various hazards to a careful throne
my lord i would fain go w'ee there's small fortune in staying here behind
the churlish brow of war fair dearest is a sight of horror for ladies' entertainment if thou hear'st a truth of my sad ending by the hand of some unnatural subject thou withal shalt hear how i died worthy of my right by falling like a king and in the close which my last breath shall sound thy name thou fairest shalt sing a requiem to my soul unwilling only of greater glory 'cause divided from such a heaven on earth as life with thee
but these are chimes for funerals my business attends on fortune of a sprightlier triumph for love and majesty are reconciled and vow to crown thee empress of the west
you have a noble language sir your right in me is without question and however events of time may shorten my deserts in others' pity yet it shall not stagger or constancy or duty in a wife
you must be king of me and my poor heart is all i can call mine
but we will live live beauteous virtue by the lively test of our own blood to let the counterfeit be known the world's contempt
pray do not use that word it carries fate in't
the first suit i ever made i trust your love will grant
that hereafter if you return with safety no adventure may sever us in tasting any fortune i ne'er can stay behind again
y'are lady of your desires and shall command your will yet 'tis too hard to promise
what our destinies have ruled out in their books we must not search but kneel to

princes are dear to heaven who meet with subjects sincere in their employments such i find your commendation sir
let me deliver how joyful i repute the amity with your most fortunate master who almost comes near a miracle in his success against the moors who had devoured his country entire now to his sceptre
we for our part will imitate his providence in hope of partage in the use on't we repute the privacy of his advisement to us by you intended an ambassador to scotland for a peace between our kingdoms a policy of love which well becomes his wisdom and our care
your majesty doth understand him rightly
else your knowledge can instruct me wherein sir to fall on ceremony would seem useless which shall not need for i will be as studious of your concealment in our conference as any council shall advise
then sir my chief request is that on notice given at my dispatch in scotland you will send some learnèd man of power and experience to join entreaty with me
i shall do it being that way well provided by a servant which may attend 'ee ever
if king james by any indirection should perceive my coming near your court i doubt the issue of my employment
be not your own herald i learn sometimes without a teacher
good days guard all your princely thoughts
urswick no further than the next open gallery attend him
− a hearty love go with you
exeunt urswick and hialas
king ferdinand is not so much a fox but that a cunning huntsman may in time fall on the scent in honourable actions safe imitation best deserves a praise
what the castilian's passed away
he is and undiscovered the two hundred marks your majesty conveyed 'a gently pursed with a right modest gravity
what was't muttered in the earnest of his wisdom
spoke not to be heard; 'twas about − urs
warbeck how if king henry were but sure of subjects such a wild runagate might soon be caged no great ado withstanding
nay nay something about my son prince arthur's match
right right sir he hummed it out how that king ferdinand swore that the marriage 'twixt the lady katherine his daughter and the prince of wales your son should never be consummated as long as any earl of warwick lived in england except by new creation
i remember 'twas so indeed the king his master swore it
directly as he said
an earl of warwick

our news from scotland creeps it comes so slow we must have airy spirits our time requires dispatch

enter on the walls the bishop of durham armed a truncheon in his hand with soldiers
see the jolly clerk appears trimmed like a ruffian
bishop yet set ope the ports and to your lawful sovereign richard of york surrender up this castle and he will take thee to his grace else tweed shall overflow his banks with english blood and wash the sand that céments those hard stones from their foundation
warlike king of scotland vouchsafe a few words from a man enforced to lay his book aside and clap on arms unsuitable to my age or my profession
courageous prince consider on what grounds you rend the face of peace and break a league with a confederate king that courts your amity for whom too
for a vagabond a straggler not noted in the world by birth or name an obscure peasant by the rage of hell loosed from his chains to set great kings at strife
what nobleman what common man of note what ordinary subject hath come in since first you footed on our territories to only feign a welcome
children laugh at your proclamations and the wiser pity so great a potentate's abuse by one who juggles merely with the fawns and youth of an instructed compliment such spoils such slaughters as the rapine of your soldiers already have committed is enough to shew your zeal in a conceited justice
yet great king wake not yet my master's vengeance but shake that viper off which gnaws your entrails
i and my fellow subjects are resolved if you persist to stand your utmost fury till our last blood drop from us
o sir lend no ear to this traducer of my honour
− what shall i call thee thou gray bearded scandal that kick'st against the sovereignty to which thou ow'st allegiance
− treason is bold faced and eloquent in mischief sacred king be deaf to his known malice
to james rather yield unto those holy motions which inspire the sacred heart of an anointed body
it is the surest policy in princes to govern well their own than seek encroachment upon another's right
aside to dalyell the king is serious deep in his meditations
aside to crawford lift them up to heaven his better genius
to james can you study while such a devil raves
well bishop you'll not be drawn to mercy
conster me in like case by a subject of your own my resolution's fixed king james be counselled a greater fate waits on thee
exeunt bishop of durham and soldiers from the walls

you fool your piety ridiculously careful of an interest another man possesseth
shrewdly the bishop guessed of your adherents when not a petty burgess of some town no not a villager hath yet appeared in your assistance that should make 'ee whine and not your country's sufferance as you term it
the king is angry
and the passionate duke effeminately dolent
the experience in former trials sir both of mine own or other princes cast out of their thrones have so acquainted me how misery is destitute of friends or of relief that i can easily submit to taste lowest reproof without contempt or words
an humble minded man
now what intelligence speaks master secretary frion
henry of england hath in open field o'erthrown the armies who opposed him in the right of this young prince
his subsidies you mean − more if you have it
howard earl of surrey backed by twelve earls and barons of the north an hundred knights and gentlemen of name and twenty thousand soldiers is at hand to raise your siege
brooke with a goodly navy is admiral at sea and dawbney follows with an unbroken army for a second
they come to side with us
retreat we shall not find them stones and walls to cope with
− yet duke of york for such thou sayst thou art i'll try thy fortune to the height to surrey by marchmont i will send a brave defiance for single combat once a king will venture his person to an earl with condition of spilling lesser blood surrey is bold and james resolved
o rather gracious sir create me to this glory since my cause doth interest this fair quarrel valued least i am his equal
i will be the man
− march softly off "where victory can reap a harvest crowned with triumph toil is cheap
the english camp near ayton on the borders
enter earl of surrey bishop of durham soldiers with drums and colours
are all our braving enemies shrunk back hid in the fogs of their distempered climate not daring to behold our colours wave in spite of this infected air
can they look on the strength of cundrestine defaced
the glory of hedon hall devasted
that of edington cast down
the pile of fulden o'erthrown
and this the strongest of their forts old ayton castle yielded and demolished
and yet not peep abroad
the scots are bold hardy in battle but it seems the cause they undertake considerèd appears unjointed in the frame on't
noble surrey our royal master's wisdom is at all times his fortune's harbinger for when he draws his sword to threaten war his providence settles on peace the crowning of an empire
rank all in order 'tis a herald's sound some message from king james keep a fixed station
enter marchmont and another in heralds' coats
from scotland's awful majesty we come unto the english general
thus then the waste and prodigal effusiön of so much guiltless blood as in two potent armies of necessity must glut the earth's dry womb his sweet compassion hath studied to prevent for which to thee great earl of surrey in a single fight he offers his own royal person fairly proposing these conditions only that if victory conclude our master's right the earl shall deliver for his ransom the town of berwick to him with the fishgarths if surrey shall prevail the king will pay a thousand pounds down present for his freedom and silence further arms so speaks king james
so speaks king james
so like a king 'a speaks
heralds the english general returns a sensible devotion from his heart his very soul to this unfellowed grace for let the king know gentle heralds truly how his descent from his great throne to honour a stranger subject with so high a title as his compeer in arms hath conquered more than any sword could do; for which − my loyalty respected − i will serve his virtues ever in all humility but berwick say is none of mine to part with "in affairs of princes subjects cannot traffic rights inherent to the crown
" my life is mine that i dare freely hazard; and − with pardon to some unbribed vainglory − if his majesty shall taste a change of fate his liberty shall meet no articles
if i fall falling so bravely i refer me to his pleasure without condition and for this dear favour say if not countermanded i will cease hostility unless provoked
this answer we shall relate unpartially
to marchmont with favour pray have a little patience
− aside to surrey sir you find by these gay flourishes how wearied travail inclines a willing rest here's but a prologue however confidently uttered meant for some ensuing acts of peace consider the time of year unseasonableness of weather charge barrenness of profit and occasion presents itself for honourable treaty which we may make good use of
i will back as sent from you in point of noble gratitude unto king james with these his heralds you shall shortly hear from me my lord for order of breathing or proceeding and king henry doubt not will thank the service
aside to durham to your wisdom lord bishop i refer it
aside to surrey be it so then
heralds accept this chain and these few crowns
our duty noble general
in part of retribution for such princely love my lord the general is pleased to shew the king your master his sincerest zeal by further treaty by no common man i will myself return with you
oblige my faithfullest affections t'ee lord bishop
all happiness attend your lordship

enter perkin warbeck and frion
frion o frion all my hopes of glory are at a stand
the scottish king grows dull frosty and wayward since this spanish agent hath mixed discourses with him they are private
i am not called to council now − confusion on all his crafty shrugs
i feel the fabric of my designs are tottering
henry's policies stir with too many engines
let his mines shaped in the bowels of the earth blow up works raised for my defence yet can they never toss into air the freedom of my birth or disavow my blood plantagenet's i am my father's son still
− but o frion when i bring into count with my disasters my wife's compartnership my kate's my life's then then my frailty feels an earthquake
mischief damn henry's plots
i will be england's king or let my aunt of burgundy report my fall in the attempt deserved our ancestors
you grow too wild in passion if you will appear a prince indeed confine your will to moderation
what a saucy rudeness prompts this distrust
" "if i will appear
" "appear a prince
" death throttle such deceits even in their birth of utterance
cursèd cozenage of trust
ye make me mad 'twere best it seems that i should turn impostor to myself be mine own counterfeit belie the truth of my dear mother's womb the sacred bed of a prince murthered and a living baffled
nay if you have no ears to hear i have no breath to spend in vain
sir sir take heed
gold and the promise of promotion rarely fail in temptation
why to me this
speak what you will we are not sunk so low but your advice may piece again the heart which many cares have broken you were wont in all extremities to talk of comfort have ye none left now
i'll not interrupt ye
good bear with my distractions
if king james deny us dwelling here next whither must i preethee be not angry
sir i told ye of letters come from ireland how the cornish stomach their last defeat and humbly sue that with such forces as you could partake you would in person land in cornwall where thousands will entertain your title gladly

ah sweet young prince

'tis but going to sea and leaping ashore cut ten or twelve thousand unnecessary throats fire seven or eight towns take half a dozen cities get into the market place crown him richard the fourth and the business is finished
i grant ye quoth i so far forth as men may do no more than men may do for it is good to consider when consideration may be to the purpose otherwise − still you shall pardon me − little said is soon amended
then you conclude the cornish action surest
we do so and doubt not but to thrive abundantly
− ho my masters had we known of the commotion when we set sail out of ireland the land had been ours ere this time
'tis but forbearing being an earl or a duke a month or two longer
i say and say it again if the work go not on apace let me never see new fashion more
i warrant ye i warrant ye we will have it so and so it shall be
this is but a cold phlegmatic country not stirring enough for men of spirit
give me the heart of england for my money
a man may batten there in a week only with hot loaves and butter and a lusty cup of muscadine and sugar at breakfast though he make never a meal all the month after
surely when i bore office i found by experience that to be much troublesome was to be much wise and busy i have observed how filching and bragging has been the best service in these last wars and therefore conclude peremptorily on the design in england
if things and things may fall out as who can tell what or how − but the end will shew it
resolved like men of judgment
here to linger more time is but to lose it cheer the prince and haste him on to this on this depends fame in success or glory in our ends

no news from scotland yet my lord
not any but what king henry knows himself i thought our armies should have marched that way his mind it seems is altered
victory attends his standard everywhere
wise princes oxford fight not alone with forces
providence directs and tutors strength else elephants and barbèd horses might as well prevail as the most subtle stratagems of war
the scottish king shewed more than common bravery in proffer of a combat hand to hand with surrey
and but shewed it northern bloods are gallant being fired but the cold climate without good store of fuël quickly freezeth the glowing flames
surrey upon my life would not have shrunk an hair's breadth
may 'a forfeit the honour of an english name and nature who would not have embraced it with a greediness as violent as hunger runs to food
'twas an addition any worthy spirit would covet next to immortality above all joys of life we all missed shares in that great opportunity
enter king henry and urswick whispering
see 'a comes smiling
o the game runs smooth on his side then believe it cards well shuffled and dealt with cunning bring some gamester thrift but others must rise losers
i knew it should not miss
he fondly angles who will hurl his bait into the water 'cause the fish at first plays round about the line and dares not bite
− lords we may reign your king yet dawbney oxford urswick must perkin wear the crown
now if frion his practised politician wear a brain of proof king perkin will in progress ride through all his large dominions let us meet him and tender homage ha sirs
liegemen ought to pay their fealty
would the rascal were with all his rabble within twenty miles of london
farther off is near enough to lodge him in his home i'll wager odds surrey and all his men are either idle or hasting back they have not work i doubt to keep them busy
'tis a strange conceit sir
such voluntary favours as our people in duty aid us with we never scattered on cobweb parasites or lavished out in riot or a needless hospitality no undeserving favourite doth boast his issues from our treasury our charge flows through all europe proving us but steward of every contribution which provides against the creeping canker of disturbance
is it not rare then in this toil of state wherein we are embarked with breach of sleep cares and the noise of trouble that our mercy returns nor thanks nor comfort
still the west murmur and threaten innovatiön whisper our government tyrannical deny us what is ours nay spurn their lives of which they are but owners by our gift it must not be

dawbney and oxford since our army stands entire it were a weakness to admit the rust of laziness to eat amongst them set forward toward salisbury the plains are most commodious for their exercise
ourself will take a muster of them there and or disband them with reward or else dispose as best concerns us
sir all is peace at salisbury

these general acclamations are an omen of happy process to their welcome lord they flock in troops and from all parts with wings of duty fly to lay their hearts before us
− unequalled pattern of a matchless wife how fares my dearest yet
confirmed in health by which i may the better undergo the roughest face of change but i shall learn patience to hope since silence courts affliction for comforts to this truly noble gentleman − rare unexampled pattern of a friend
− and my belovèd jane the willing follower of all misfortunes
lady i return but barren crops of early protestations frost bitten in the spring of fruitless hopes
i wait but as the shadow to the body for madam without you let me be nothing
none talk of sadness − we are on the way which leads to victory keep cowards thoughts with desperate sullenness
the lion faints not locked in a grate but loose disdains all force which bars his prey − and we are lion hearted or else no king of beasts
another general shout within
− hark how they shout triumphant in our cause
bold confidence marches on bravely cannot quake at danger
save king richard the fourth

such advantage hath majesty in its pursuit of justice that on the proppers up of truth's old throne it both enlightens counsel and gives heart to execution whiles the throats of traitors lie bare before our mercy
− o divinity of royal birth
how it strikes dumb the tongues whose prodigality of breath is bribed by trains to greatness
princes are but men distinguished in the fineness of their frailty yet not so gross in beauty of the mind for there's a fire more sacred purifies the dross of mixture
herein stands the odds "subjects are men on earth kings men and gods
enter lady katherine and jane in riding suits with one servant
it is decreed and we must yield to fate whose angry justice though it threaten ruin contempt and poverty is all but trial of a weak woman's constancy in suffering
here in a stranger's and an enemy's land forsaken and unfurnished of all hopes but such as wait on misery i range to meet affliction wheresoe'er i tread
my train and pomp of servants is reduced to one kind gentlewoman and this groom
− sweet jane now whither must we

fly thou to scotland thou hast friends will weep for joy to bid thee welcome but o jane my jane
my friends are desperate of comfort as i must be of them the common charity good people's alms and prayers of the gentle is the revénue must support my state
as for my native country since it once saw me a princess in the height of greatness my birth allowed me here i make a vow scotland shall never see me being fallen or lessened in my fortunes
never jane never to scotland more will i return
could i be england's queen − a glory jane i never fawned on − yet the king who gave me hath sent me with my husband from his presence delivered us suspected to his nation rendered us spectacles to time and pity and is it fit i should return to such as only listen after our descent from happiness enjoyed to misery expected though uncertain
− alas why dost thou weep
and that poor creature wipe his wet cheeks too
let me feel alone extremities who know to give them harbour nor thou nor he has cause you may live safely
there is no safety whiles your dangers madam are every way apparent
pardon lady i cannot choose but shew my honest heart you were ever my good lady
o dear souls your shares in grief are too too much
i bring fair princess news of further sadness yet than your sweet youth hath been acquainted with
not more my lord than i can welcome speak it the worst the worst i look for
all the cornish at exeter were by the citizens repulsed encountered by the earl of devonshire and other worthy gentlemen of the country
your husband marched to taunton and was there affronted by king henry's chamberlain the king himself in person with his army advancing nearer to renew the fight on all occasions but the night before the battles were to join your husband privately accompanied with some few horse departed from out the camp and posted none knows whither
fled without battle given
fled but followed by dawbney all his parties left to taste king henry's mercy − for to that they yielded − victorious without bloodshed
if both our lives had proved the sacrifice to henry's tyranny we had fall'n like princes and robbed him of the glory of his pride
impute it not to faintness or to weakness of noble courage lady but to foresight for by some secret friend he had intelligence of being bought and sold by his base followers
worse yet remains untold
no no it cannot
i fear you are betrayed the earl of oxford runs hot in your pursuit
shall not need we'll run as hot in resolution gladly to make the earl our jailor

− what reason draws you hither gentlemen
− with favour lady from henry england's king i would present unto the beauteous princess katherine gordon the tender of a gracious entertainment
we are that princess whom your master king pursues with reaching arms to draw into his power let him use his tyranny we shall not be his subject
my commission extends no further excellentest lady than to a service 'tis king henry's pleasure that you and all that have relation t'ee be guarded as becomes your birth and greatness for rest assured sweet princess that not aught of what you do call yours shall find disturbance or any welcome other than what suits your high condition
by what title sir may i acknowledge you
your servant lady descended from the line of oxford's earls inherits what his ancestors before him were owners of
your king is herein royal that by a peer so ancient in desert as well as blood commands us to his presence
invites 'ee princess not commands
pray use your own phrase as you list to your protection both i and mine submit
there's in your number a nobleman whom fame hath bravely spoken
to him the king my master bad me say how willingly he courts his friendship far from an enforcement more than what in terms of courtesy so great a prince may hope for
my name is dalyell
‘tis a name hath won both thanks and wonder from report my lord the court of england emulates your merit and covets to embrace 'ee
i must wait on the princess in her fortunes
will you please great lady to set forward

so let him he is hedged too fast within the circuit of our english pale to steal out of our ports or leap the walls which guard our land the seas are rough and wider than his weak arms can tug with
− surrey henceforth your king may reign in quiet turmoils past like some unquiet dream have rather busied our fancy than affrighted rest of state
− but surrey why in articling a peace with james of scotland was not restitution of losses which our subjects did sustain by the scotch inroads questioned
both demanded and urged my lord to which the king replied in modest merriment but smiling earnest how that our master henry was much abler to bear the detriments than he repay them
the young man i believe spake honest truth studies to be wise betimes

dawbney we observe no wonder i behold 'tis true an ornament of nature fine and polished a handsome youth indeed but not admire him
how came he to thy hands
from sanctuary at bewley near southampton registered with these few followers for persons privileged
i must not thank you sir you were to blame infringe the liberty of houses sacred dare we be irreligious
gracious lord they voluntarily resigned themselves without compulsion
'twas very well 'twas very very well
− to warbeck turn now thine eyes young man upon thyself and thy past actions what revels in combustion through our kingdom a frenzy of aspiring youth hath danced till wanting breath thy feet of pride have slipt to break thy neck
but not my heart my heart will mount till every drop of blood be frozen by death's perpetual winter if the sun of majesty be darkened let the sun of life be hid from me in an eclipse lasting and universal
sir remember there was a shooting in of light when richmond not aiming at a crown retired and gladly for comfort to the duke of bretaine's court
richard who swayed the sceptre was reputed a tyrant then yet then a dawning glimmered to some few wandering remnants promising day when first they ventured on a frightful shore at milford haven; − dawb
whither speeds his boldness
− check his rude tongue great sir
o let him range the player's on the stage still 'tis his part does but act
bosworth field where at an instant to the world's amazement a morn to richmond and a night to richard appeared at once the tale is soon applied fate which crowned these attempts when least assured might have befriended others like resolved
thus your aunt of burgundy your duchess aunt informed her nephew so the lesson prompted and well conned was moulded into familiar dialogue oft rehearsed till learnt by heart 'tis now received for truth
truth in her pure simplicity wants art to put a feignèd blush on scorn wears only such fashion as commends to gazers' eyes sad ulcerated novelty far beneath the sphere of majesty in such a court wisdom and gravity are proper robes by which the sovereign is best distinguished from zanies to his greatness
sirrah shift your antic pageantry and now appear in your own nature or you'll taste the danger of fooling out of season
i expect no less than what severity calls justice and politicians safety let such beg as feed on alms but if there can be mercy in a protested enemy then may it descend to these poor creatures whose engagements to th' bettering of their fortunes have incurred a loss of all to them if any charity flow from some noble orator in death i owe the fee of thankfulness

canst thou hope a pardon where thy guilt is so apparent
under your good favours as men are men they may err for i confess respectively in taking great parts the one side prevailing the other side must go down herein the point is clear if the proverb hold that hanging goes by destiny that it is to little purpose to say this thing or that shall be thus or thus for as the fates will have it so it must be and who can help it
thou a privy counsellor
beg life and cry aloud "heaven save king henry
every man knows what is best as it happens for my own part i believe it is true if i be not deceived that kings must be kings and subjects subjects but which is which you shall pardon me for that whether we speak or hold our peace all are mortal no man knows his end

you may not kneel tis most unfitting first vouchsafe this welcome a welcome to your own for you shall find us but guardian to your fortune and your honours

− so so there; 'tis as it should be put on the padlock and give me the key
− off i say keep off
yet warbeck clear thy conscience thou hast tasted king henry's mercy liberally the law has forfeited thy life an equal jury have doomed thee to the gallows twice most wickedly most desperately hast thou escaped the tower inveigling to thy party with thy witchcraft young edward earl of warwick son to clarence whose head must pay the price of that attempt poor gentleman unhappy in his fate and ruined by thy cunning
so a mungrel may pluck the true stag down
yet yet confess thy parentage for yet the king has mercy
you would be dick the fourth very likely
your pedigree is published you are known for osbeck's son of tournay a loose runagate a landloper your father was a jew turned christian merely to repair his miseries where's now your kingship
baited to my death
i laugh at the duke of richmond's practice on my fortunes possession of a crown ne'er wanted heralds
you will not know who i am
lambert simnel your predecessor in a dangerous uproar but on submission not alone received to grace but by the king vouchsafed his service
i would be earl of warwick toiled and ruffled against my master leaped to catch the moon vaunted my name plantagenet as you do an earl forsooth
whenas in truth i was as you are a mere rascal yet his majesty a prince composed of sweetness − heaven protect him
− forgave me all my villainies reprieved the sentence of a shameful end admitted my surety of obedience to his service and i am now his falconer live plenteously eat from the king's purse and enjoy the sweetness of liberty and favour sleep securely and is not this now better than to buffet the hangman's clutches or to brave the cordage of a tough halter which will break your neck
− so then the gallant totters
− preethee perkin let my example lead thee be no longer a counterfeit confess and hope for pardon
hold my heart strings whiles contempt of injuries in scorn may bid defiance to this base man's foul language
− thou poor vermin how dar'st thou creep so near me
why thou enjoy'st as much of happiness as all the swinge of slight ambition flew at
a dunghill was thy cradle
so a puddle by virtue of the sunbeams breathes a vapour infect the purer air which drops again into the muddy womb that first exhaled it
bread and a slavish ease with some assurance from the base beadle's whip crowned all thy hopes but sirrah ran there in thy veins one drop of such a royal blood as flows in mine thou wouldst not change condition to be second in england's state without the crown itself
coarse creatures are incapable of excellence but let the world as all to whom i am this day a spectacle to time deliver and by tradition fix posterity without another chronicle than truth how constantly my resolution suffered a martyrdom of majesty

great miracle of constancy
my miseries were never bankrout of their confidence in worst afflictions till this now i feel them
report and thy deserts thou best of creatures might to eternity have stood a pattern for every virtuous wife without this conquest
thou hast outdone belief yet may their ruin in after marriages be never pitied to whom thy story shall appear a fable
why wouldst thou prove so much unkind to greatness to glorify thy vows by such a servitude
i cannot weep but trust me dear my heart is liberal of passion
− harry richmond a woman's faith hath robbed thy fame of triumph
sirrah leave off your juggling and tie up the devil that ranges in your tongue
thus witches possessed even to their deaths deluded say they have been wolves and dogs and sailed in egg shells over the sea and rid on fiery dragons passed in the air more than a thousand miles all in a night − the enemy of mankind is powerful but false and falsehood confident
remember lady who you are come from that impudent impostor

impoverish time of its amazement friends and we will prove as trusty in our payments as prodigal to nature in our debts
'tis but a sound a name of air a minute's storm or not so much to tumble from bed to bed be massacred alive by some physicians for a month or two in hope of freedom from a fever's torments might stagger manhood here the pain is past ere sensibly 'tis felt

here has appeared though in a several fashion the threats of majesty the strength of passion hopes of an empire change of fortunes all what can to theätres of greatness fall proving their weak foundations
