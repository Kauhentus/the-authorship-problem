truth says of old the art of making plays was to content the people and their praise was to the poet money wine and bays
but in this age a sect of writers are that only for particular likings care and will taste nothing that is popular
with such we mingle neither brains nor breasts our wishes like to those make public feasts are not to please the cook's taste but the guests'
yet if those cunning palates hither come they shall find guests' entreaty and good room and though all relish not sure there will be some that when they leave their seats shall make them say who wrote that piece could so have wrote a play but that he knew this was the better way
for to present all custard or all tart and have no other meats to bear a part
or to want bread and salt were but course art
the poet prays you then with better thought to sit and when his cates are all in brought though there be none far fet there will dear bought be fit for ladies some for lords knights 'squires some for your waiting wench and city wires some for your men and daughters of whitefriars
nor is it only while you keep your seat here that his feast will last but you shall eat a week at ord'naries on his broken meat if his muse be true who commends her to you
the ends of all who for the scene do write are or should be to profit and delight
and still't hath been the praise of all best times so persons were not touch'd to tax the crimes
then in this play which we present to night and make the object of your ear and sight on forfeit of yourselves think nothing true lest so you make the maker to judge you for he knows poet never credit gain'd by writing truths but things like truths well feign'd
if any yet will with particular sleight of application wrest what he doth write and that he meant or him or her will say they make a libel which he made a play
a have you got the song yet perfect i gave you boy
let me hear it
you shall sir but i'faith let nobody else
it will get you the dangerous name of a poet in town sir besides me a perfect deal of ill will at the mansion you wot of whose lady is the argument of it where now i am the welcomest thing under a man that comes there
i think and above a man too if the truth were rack'd out of you
no faith i'll confess before sir
the gentlewomen play with me and throw me on the bed and carry me in to my lady and she kisses me with her oil'd face and puts a peruke on my head and asks me an i will wear her gown
and i say no and then she hits me a blow o' the ear and calls me innocent
and lets me go
no marvel if the door be kept shut against your master when the entrance is so easy to you well sir you shall go there no more lest i be fain to seek your voice in my lady's rushes a fortnight hence
still to be neat still to be drest why here's the man that can melt away his time and never feels it
what between his mistress abroad and his ingle at home high fare soft lodging fine clothes and his fiddle he thinks the hours have no wings or the day no post horse
well sir gallant were you struck with the plague this minute or condemn'd to any capital punishment to morrow you would begin then to think and value every article of your time esteem it at the true rate and give all for it
why what should a man do
why nothing or that which when it is done is as idle
harken after the next horse race or hunting match lay wagers praise puppy or pepper corn white foot franklin swear upon whitemane's party speak aloud that my lords may hear you visit my ladies at night and be able to give them the character of every bowler or better on the green
these be the things wherein your fashionable men exercise themselves and i for company
nay if i have thy authority i'll not leave yet
come the other are considerations when we come to have gray heads and weak hams moist eyes and shrunk members
we'll think on 'em then and we'll pray and fast
ay and destine only that time of age to goodness which our want of ability will not let us employ in evil
why then 'tis time enough
yes as if a man should sleep all the term and think to effect his business the last day
o clerimont this time because it is an incorporeal thing and not subject to sense we mock ourselves the fineliest out of it with vanity and misery indeed
not seeking an end of wretchedness but only changing the matter still
nay thou wilt not leave now see but our common disease
with what justice can we complain that great men will not look upon us nor be at leisure to give our affairs such dispatch as we expect when we will never do it to ourselves
nor hear nor regard ourselves
thou hast read plutarch's morals now or some such tedious fellow and it shews so vilely with thee
'fore god 'twill spoil thy wit utterly
talk me of pins and feathers and ladies and rushes and such things and leave this stoicity alone till thou mak'st sermons
well sir if it will not take i have learn'd to lose as little of my kindness as i can
i'll do good to no man against his will certainly
when were you at the college
as if you knew not
no faith i came but from court yesterday
why is it not arrived there yet the news
a new foundation sir here in the town of ladies that call themselves the collegiates an order between courtiers and country madams that live from their husbands and give entertainment to all the wits and braveries of the time as they call them cry down or up what they like or dislike in a brain or a fashion with most masculine or rather hermaphroditical authority and every day gain to their college some new probationer
who is the president
the grave and youthful matron the lady haughty
a pox of her autumnal face her pieced beauty
there's no man can be admitted till she be ready now a days till she has painted and perfumed and wash'd and scour'd but the boy here and him she wipes her oil'd lips upon like a sponge
i have made a song i pray thee hear it on the subject
still to be neat still to be drest as you were going to a feast still to be powder'd still perfum'd lady it is to be presumed though art's hid causes are not found all is not sweet all is not sound
give me a look give me a face that makes simplicity a grace robes loosely flowing hair as free such sweet neglect more taketh me then all the adulteries of art they strike mine eyes but not my heart
and i am clearly on the other side i love a good dressing before any beauty o' the world
o a woman is then like a delicate garden nor is there one kind of it she may vary every hour take often counsel of her glass and choose the best
if she have good ears shew them good hair lay it out good legs wear short clothes a good hand discover it often practise any art to mend breath cleanse teeth repair eye brows paint and profess it
the doing of it not the manner that must be private
many things that seem foul in the doing do please done
a lady should indeed study her face when we think she sleeps nor when the doors are shut should men be enquiring all is sacred within then
is it for us to see their perukes put on their false teeth their complexion their eye brows their nails
you see guilders will not work but inclosed
they must not discover how little serves with the help of art to adorn a great deal
how long did the canvas hang afore aldgate
were the people suffered to see the city's love and charity while they were rude stone before they were painted and burnish'd
no no more should servants approach their mistresses but when they are complete and finish'd
well said my truewit
and a wise lady will keep a guard always upon the place that she may do things securely
i once followed a rude fellow into a chamber where the poor madam for haste and troubled snatch'd at her peruke to cover her baldness and put it on the wrong way
and the unconscionable knave held her in complement an hour with that reverst face when i still look'd when she should talk from the t'other side
why thou shouldst have relieved her
no faith i let her alone as we'll let this argument if you please and pass to another
when saw you dauphine eugenie
not these three days
shall we go to him this morning
he is very melancholy i hear
sick of the uncle
i met that stiff piece of formality his uncle yesterday with a huge turban of night caps on his head buckled over his ears
o that's his custom when he walks abroad
he can endure no noise man
so i have heard
but is the disease so ridiculous in him as it is made
they say he has been upon divers treaties with the fish wives and orange women and articles propounded between them marry the chimney sweepers will not be drawn in
no nor the broom men they stand out stiffly
he cannot endure a costard monger he swoons if he hear one
methinks a smith should be ominous
or any hammer man
a brasier is not suffer'd to dwell in the parish nor an armourer
he would have hang'd a pewterer's prentice once on a shrove tuesday's riot for being of that trade when the rest were quit
a trumpet should fright him terribly or the hautboys
out of his senses
the waights of the city have a pension of him not to come near that ward
this youth practised on him one night like the bell man and never left till he had brought him down to the door with a long sword and there left him flourishing with the air
why sir he hath chosen a street to lie in so narrow at both ends that it will receive no coaches nor carts nor any of these common noises and therefore we that love him devise to bring him in such as we may now and then for his exercise to breathe him
he would grow resty else in his ease his virtue would rust without action
i entreated a bearward one day to come down with the dogs of some four parishes that way and i thank him he did and cried his games under master morose's window till he was sent crying away with his head made a most bleeding spectacle to the multitude
and another time a fencer marchng to his prize had his drum most tragically run through for taking that street in his way at my request
how does he for the bells
o in the queen's time he was wont to go out of town every saturday at ten o'clock or on holy day eves
but now by reason of the sickness the perpetuity of ringing has made him devise a room with double walls and treble ceilings the windows close shut and caulk'd and there he lives by candlelight
he turn'd away a man last week for having a pair of new shoes that creak'd
and this fellow waits on him now in tennis court socks or slippers soled with wool and they talk each to other in a trunk
see who comes here
what ail you sirs
struck into stone almost i am here with tales o' thine uncle
there was never such a prodigy heard of
i would you would once lose this subject my masters for my sake
they are such as you are that have brought me into that predicament i am with him
marry that he will disinherit me no more
he thinks i and my company are authors of all the ridiculous acts and monuments are told of him
s'lid i would be the author of more to vex him that purpose deserves it it gives thee law of plaguing him
i will tell thee what i would do
i would make a false almanack get it printed and then have him drawn out on a coronation day to the tower wharf and kill him with the noise of the ordnance
art not thou next of blood and his sister's son
ay but he will thrust me out of it he vows and marry
that's a more portent
can he endure no noise and will venture on a wife
yes why thou art a stranger it seems to his best trick yet
he has employed a fellow this half year all over england to hearken him out a dumb woman be she of any form or any quality so she be able to bear children her silence is dowry enough he says
but i trust to god he has found none
no but he has heard of one that is lodged in the next street to him who is exceedingly soft spoken thrifty of her speech that spends but six words a day
and her he's about now and shall have her
who is his agent in the business
marry a barber one cutbeard an honest fellow one that tells dauphine all here
why you oppress me with wonder a woman and a barber and love no noise
the fellow trims him silently and has not the knack with his sheers or his fingers and that continence in a barber he thinks so eminent a virtue as it has made him chief of his counsel
is the barber to be seen or the wench
yes that they are
i prithee dauphine let us go thither
i have some business now i cannot i'faith
you shall have no business shall make you neglect this sir we'll make her talk believe it or if she will not we can give out at least so much as shall interrupt the treaty we will break it
thou art bound in conscience when he suspects thee without cause to torment him
not i by any means
i will give no suffrage to't
he shall never have that plea against me that i opposed the least phant'sy of his
let it lie upon my stars to be guilty i'll be innocent
yes and be poor and beg do innocent when some groom of his has got him an heir or this barber if he himself cannot
i prithee ned where lies she
let him be innocent still
why right over against the barber's in the house where sir john daw lies
you do not mean to confound me
does he that would marry her know so much
'twere enough of imputation to her with him
the only talking sir in the town
and he teach her not to speak
god be wi' you
* i have some business too
will you not go thither then
not with the danger to meet daw for mine ears
i thought you two had been upon very good terms
yes of keeping distance
they say he is a very good scholar
ay and he says it first
a pox on him a fellow that pretends only to learning buys titles and nothing else of books in him
the world reports him to be very learned
i am sorry the world should so conspire to belie him
good faith i have heard very good things come from him
you may there's none so desperately ignorant to deny that would they were his own
god be wi' you gentleman
this is very abrupt
come you are a strange open man to tell every thing thus
why believe it dauphine truewit's a very honest fellow
i think no other but this frank nature of his is not for secrets
nay then you are mistaken dauphine i know where he has been well trusted and discharged the trust very truly and heartily
i contend not ned but with the fewer a business is carried it is ever the safer
now we are alone if you will go thither i am for you
when were you there
last night and such a decameron of sport fallen out
boccace never thought of the like
daw does nothing but court her and the wrong way
he would lie with her and praises her modesty desires that she would talk and be free and commends her silence in verses which he reads and swears are the best that ever man made
then rails at his fortunes stamps and mutines why he is not made a counsellor and call'd to affairs of state
i prithee let's go
i would fain partake this
we are invited to dinner together he and i by one that came thither to him sir la foole
o that's a precious mannikin
do you know him
ay and he will know you too if e'er he saw you but once though you should meet him at church in the midst of prayers
he is one of the braveries though he be none of the wits
he will salute a judge upon the bench and a bishop in the pulpit a lawyer when he is pleading at the bar and a lady when she is dancing in a masque and put her out
he does give plays and suppers and invites his guests to them aloud out of his window as they ride by in coaches
he has a lodging in the strand for the purpose or to watch when ladies are gone to the china houses or the exchange that he may meet them by chance and give them presents some two or three hundred pounds' worth of toys to be laugh'd at
he is never without a spare banquet or sweet meats in his chamber for their women to alight at and come up to for a bait
he was a fine youth last night but now he is much finer
what is his christian name
sir amorous la foole
the gentleman is here below that owns that name
'heart he's come to invite me to dinner i hold my life
like enough prithee let's have him up
with a truncheon sir
away i beseech you
i'll make him tell us his pedegree now and what meat he has to dinner and who are his guests and the whole course of his fortunes with a breath
f 'save dear sir dauphine
you have very much honested my lodging with your presence
f good faith it is a fine lodging almost as delicate a lodging as mine
f excuse me sir if it were in the strand i assure you
i am come master clerimont to entreat you to wait upon two or three ladies to dinner to day
did you ever see me carry dishes
f no sir dispense with me i meant to bear them company
o that i will sir the doubtfulness of your phrase believe it sir would breed you a quarrel once an hour with the terrible boys if you should but keep them fellowship a day
f it should be extremely against my will sir if i contested with any man
i believe it sir where hold you your feast
f at tom otter's sir
f captain otter sir he is a kind of gamester but he has had command both by sea and by land
o then he is animal amphibium
f ay sir his wife was the rich china woman that the courtiers visited so often that gave the rare entertainment
she commands all at home
then she is captain otter
f you say very well sir she is my kinswoman a la foole by the mother side and will invite any great ladies for my sake
not of the la fooles of essex
f no sir the la fooles of london
f they all come out of our house the la fooles of the north the la fooles of the west the la fooles of the east and south we are as ancient a family as any is in europe but i myself am descended lineally of the french la fooles and we do bear for our coat yellow or or checker'd azure and gules and some three or four colours more which is a very noted coat and has sometimes been solemnly worn by divers nobility of our house but let that go antiquity is not respected now
i had a brace of fat does sent me gentlemen and half a dozen of pheasants a dozen or two of godwits and some other fowl which i would have eaten while they are good and in good company there will be a great lady or two my lady haughty my lady centaure mistress dol mavis and they come o' purpose to see the silent gentlewoman mistress epicoene that honest sir john daw has promis'd to bring thither and then mistress trusty my lady's woman will be there too and this honourable knight sir dauphine with yourself master clerimont and we'll be very merry and have fidlers and dance
i have been a mad wag in my time and have spent some crowns since i was a page in court to my lord lofty and after my lady's gentleman usher who got me knighted in ireland since it pleased my elder brother to die
i had as fair a gold jerkin on that day as any worn in the island voyage or at cadiz none dispraised and i came over in it hither shew'd myself to my friends in court and after went down to my tenants in the country and surveyed my lands let new leases took their money spent it in the eye o' the land here upon ladies and now i can take up at my pleasure
can you take up ladies sir
o let him breathe he has not recover'd
would i were your half in that commodity
no sir excuse me i meant money which can take up any thing
i have another guest or two to invite and say as much to gentlemen
i will take my leave abruptly in hope you will not fail your servant
we will not fail you sir precious la foole but she shall that your ladies come to see if i have credit afore sir daw
did you ever hear such a wind sucker as this
or such a rook as the other
that will betray his mistress to be seen
come 'tis time we prevented it
a a cannot i yet find out a more compendious method than by this trunk to save my servants the labour of speech and mine ears the discord of sounds
let me see all discourses but my own afflict me they seem harsh impertinent and irksome
is it not possible that thou should'st answer me by signs and i apprehend thee fellow
speak not though i question you
you have taken the ring off from the street door as i bade you
answer me not by speech but by silence unless it be otherwise a very good
and you have fastened on a thick quilt or flock bed on the outside of the door that if they knock with their daggers or with brick bats they can make no noise
but with your leg your answer unless it be otherwise a very good
this is not only fit modesty in a servant but good state and discretion in a master
and you have been with cutbeard the barber to have him come to me
and he will come presently
answer me not but with your leg unless it be otherwise if it be otherwise shake your head or shrug
your italian and spaniard are wise in these and it is a frugal and comely gravity
how long will it be ere cutbeard come
stay if an hour hold up your whole hand if half an hour two fingers if a quarter one a good half a quarter
and have you given him a key to come in without knocking
and is the lock oil'd and the hinges to day
and the quilting of the stairs no where worn out and bare
i see by much doctrine and impulsion it may be effected stand by
the turk in this divine discipline is admirable exceeding all the potentates of the earth still waited on by mutes and all his commands so executed yea even in the war as i have heard and in his marches most of his charges and directions given by signs and with silence an exquisite art
and i am heartily ashamed and angry oftentimes that the princes of christendom should suffer a barbarian to transcend them in so high a point of felicity
i will practise it hereafter
what villain what prodigy of mankind is that
cut his throat cut his throat
what murderer hell hound devil can this be
it is a post from the court out rogue
and must thou blow thy horn too
alas it is a post from the court sir that says he must speak with you pain of death pain of thy life be silent
a a by your leave sir i am a stranger here is your name master morose
is your name master morose
what say you sir
has harpocrates been here with his club among you
well sir i will believe you to be the man at this time i will venture upon you sir
your friends at court commend them to you sir o men
was there ever such an impudence
and are extremely solicitous for you sir
whose knave are you
mine own knave and your compeer sir
fetch me my sword you shall taste the one half of my dagger if you do groom and you the other if you stir sir be patient i charge you in the king's name and hear me without insurrection
they say you are to marry to marry
do you mark sir
how then rude companion
marry your friends do wonder sir the thames being so near wherein you may drown so handsomely or london bridge at a low fall with a fine leap to hurry you down the stream or such a delicate steeple in the town as bow to vault from or a braver height as paul's or if you affected to do it nearer home and a shorter way an excellent garret window into the street or a beam in the said garret with this halter a which they have sent and desire that you would sooner commit your grave head to this knot than to the wedlock noose or take a little sublimate and go out of the world like a rat or a fly as one said with a straw in your arse any way rather than to follow this goblin matrimony
alas sir do you ever think to find a chaste wife in these times
when there are so many masques plays puritan preachings mad folks and other strange sights to be seen daily private and public
if you had lived in king ethelred's time sir or edward the confessor you might perhaps have found one in some cold country hamlet then a dull frosty wench would have been contented with one man now they will as soon be pleased with one leg or one eye
i'll tell you sir the monstrous hazards you shall run with a wife
good sir have i ever cozen'd any friends of yours of their land
taken forfeit of their mortgage
begg'd a reversion from them
what have i done that may deserve this
nothing sir that i know but your itch of marriage
if i had made an assassinate upon your father vitiated your mother ravished your sisters i would kill you sir i would kill you if you had
why you do more in this sir it were a vengeance centuple for all facinorous acts that could be named to do that you do
alas sir i am but a messenger i but tell you what you must hear
it seems your friends are careful after your soul's health sir and would have you know the danger but you may do your pleasure for all them i persuade not sir
if after you are married your wife do run away with a vaulter or the frenchman that walks upon ropes or him that dances the jig or a fencer for his skill at his weapon why it is not their fault they have discharged their consciences when you know what may happen
nay suffer valiantly sir for i must tell you all the perils that you are obnoxious to
if she be fair young and vegetous no sweet meats ever drew more flies all the yellow doublets and great roses in the town will be there
if foul and crooked she'll be with them and buy those doublets and roses sir
if rich and that you marry her dowry not her she'll reign in your house as imperious as a widow
if noble all her kindred will be your tyrants
if fruitful as proud as may and humorous as april she must have her doctors her midwives her nurses her longings every hour though it be for the dearest morsel of man
if learned there was never such a parrot all your patrimony will be too little for the guests that must be invited to hear her speak latin and greek and you must lie with her in those languages too if you will please her
if precise you must feast all the silenced brethren once in three days salute the sisters entertain the whole family or wood of them and hear long winded exercises singings and catechisings which you are not given to and yet must give for to please the zealous matron your wife who for the holy cause will cozen you over and above
you begin to sweat sir
but this is not half i'faith you may do your pleasure notwithstanding as i said before i come not to persuade you
upon my faith master servingman if you do stir i will beat you
o what is my sin
what is my sin
then if you love your wife or rather dote on her sir o how she'll torture you
and take pleasure in your torments
you shall lie with her but when she lists she will not hurt her beauty her complexion or it must be for that jewel or that pearl when she does every half hour's pleasure must be bought anew and with the same pain and charge you woo'd her at first
then you must keep what servants she please what company she will that friend must not visit you without her license and him she loves most she will seem to hate eagerliest to decline your jealousy or feign to be jealous of you first and for that cause go live with her she friend or cousin at the college that can instruct her in all the mysteries of writing letters corrupting servants taming spies where she must have that rich gown for such a great day a new one for the next a richer for the third be served in silver have the chamber fill'd with a succession of grooms footmen ushers and other messengers besides embroiderers jewellers tire women sempsters feathermen perfumers whilst she feels not how the land drops away nor the acres melt nor foresees the change when the mercer has your woods for her velvets never weighs what her pride costs sir so she may kiss a page or a smooth chin that has the despair of a beard be a stateswoman know all the news what was done at salisbury what at the bath what at court what in progress or so she may censure poets and authors and styles and compare them daniel with spenser jonson with the t'other youth and so forth or be thought cunning in controversies or the very knots of divinity and have often in her mouth the state of the question and then skip to the mathematics and demonstration and answer in religion to one in state to another in bawdry to a third
o all this is very true sir
and then her going in disguise to that conjurer and this cunning woman where the first question is how soon you shall die
next if her present servant love her
next if she shall have a new servant
which of her family would make the best bawd male or female
what precedence she shall have by her next match
and sets down the answers and believes them above the scriptures
nay perhaps she will study the art
gentle sir have you done
have you had your pleasure of me
i'll think of these things
yes sir and then comes reeking home of vapour and sweat with going a foot and lies in a month of a new face all oil and birdlime and rises in asses' milk and is cleansed with a new fucus god be wi' you sir
one thing more which i had almost forgot
this too with whom you are to marry may have made a conveyance of her virginity afore hand as your wise widows do of their states before they marry in trust to some friend sir who can tell
or if she have not done it yet she may do upon the wedding day or the night before and antedate you cuckold
the like has been heard of in nature
'tis no devised impossible thing sir
god be wi' you i'll be bold to leave this rope with you sir for a remembrance
come have me to my chamber but first shut the door
o shut the door shut the door
is he come again
'tis i sir your barber
o cutbeard cutbeard cutbeard
here has been a cut throat with me help me in to my bed and give me physic with thy counsel
a nay an she will let her refuse at her own charges 'tis nothing to me gentlemen but she will not be invited to the like feasts or guests every day
o by no means she may not refuse to stay at home if you love your reputation 'slight you are invited thither o' purpose to be seen and laughed at by the lady of the college and her shadows
this trumpeter hath proclaim'd you
you shall not go let him be laugh'd at in your stead for not bringing you and put him to his extemporal faculty of fooling and talking loud to satisfy the company
he will suspect us talk aloud
'pray mistress epicoene let us see your verses we have sir john daw's leave do not conceal your servant's merit and your own glories
they'll prove my servant's glories if you have his leave so soon
his vain glories lady
shew them shew them mistress i dare own them
judge you what glories
nay i'll read them myself too an author must recite his own works
it is a madrigal of modesty
modest and fair for fair and good are near neighbours howe'er
no noble virtue ever was alone but two in one
that again i pray sir john
it has something in't like rare wit and sense
no noble virtue ever was alone but two in one
then when i praise sweet modesty i praise bright beauty's rays and having praised both beauty and modesty i have praised thee
how it chimes and cries tink in the close divinely
no i think 'tis plutarch
the dor on plutarch and seneca
i hate it they are mine own imaginations by that light
i wonder those fellows have such credit with gentlemen
they are very grave authors
mere essayists a few loose sentences and that's all
a man would talk so his whole age i do utter as good things every hour if they were collected and observed as either of them
he must needs living among the wits and braveries too
ay and being president of them as he is
there's aristotle a mere common place fellow plato a discourser thucydides and livy tedious and dry tacitus an entire knot sometimes worth the untying very seldom
what do you think of the poets sir john
not worthy to be named for authors
homer an old tedious prolix ass talks of curriers and chines of beef
virgil of dunging of land and bees
horace of i know not what
and so pindarus lycophron anacreon catullus seneca the tragedian lucan propertius tibullus martial juvenal ausonius statius politian valerius flaccus and the rest what a sack full of their names he has got
and how he pours them out
politian with valerius flaccus
was not the character right of him
as could be made i'faith
and persius a crabbed coxcomb not to be endured
why whom do you account for authors sir john daw
syntagma juris civilis corpus juris civilis corpus juris canonici the king of spain's bible is the king of spain's bible an author
what was that syntagma sir
a civil lawyer a spaniard
sure corpus was a dutchman
ay both the corpuses i knew 'em they were very corpulent authors
and then there's vatablus pomponatius symancha the other are not to be received within the thought of a scholar
'fore god you have a simple learned servant lady in titles
i wonder that he is not called to the helm and made a counsellor
he is one extraordinary
nay but in ordinary to say truth the state wants such
why that will follow
i muse a mistress can be so silent to the dotes of such a servant
'tis her virtue sir
i have written somewhat of her silence too
in verse sir john
how can you justify your own being of a poet that so slight all the old poets
every man that writes in verse is not a poet you have of the wits that write verses and yet are no poets they are poets that live by it the poor fellows that live by it
why would not you live by your verses sir john
no 'twere pity he should
a knight live by his verses
he did not make them to that end i hope
and yet the noble sidney lives by his and the noble family not ashamed
ay he profest himself but sir john daw has more caution he'll not hinder his own rising in the state so much
do you think he will
your verses good sir john and no poems
silence in woman is like speech in man deny't who can
not i believe it your reason sir
nor is't a tale that female vice should be a virtue male or masculine vice a female virtue be you shall it see prov'd with increase i know to speak and she to hold her peace
do you conceive me gentlemen
no faith how mean you "with increase" sir john
why with increase is when i court her for the common cause of mankind and she says nothing but "consentire videtur" and in time is gravida
then this is a ballad of procreation
a madrigal of procreation you mistake
'pray give me my verses again servant
if you'll ask them aloud you shall
see here's truewit again
where hast thou been in the name of madness
thus accoutred with thy horn
where the sound of it might have pierced your sense with gladness had you been in ear reach of it
dauphine fall down and worship me i have forbid the bans lad i have been with thy virtuous uncle and have broke the match
you have not i hope
yes faith if thou shouldst hope otherwise i should repent me this horn got me entrance kiss it
i had no other way to get in but by faining to be a post but when i got in once i proved none but rather the contrary turn'd him into a post or a stone or what is stiffer with thundering into him the incommodities of a wife and the miseries of marriage
if ever gorgon were seen in the shape of a woman he hath seen her in my description i have put him off o' that scent for ever
why do you not applaud and adore me sirs
why stand you mute
you are not worthy of the benefit
did not i tell you
i would you had placed this benefit somewhere else
'slight you have done the most inconsiderate rash weak thing that ever man did to his friend
if the most malicious enemy i have had studied to inflict an injury upon me it could not be a greater
wherein for gods sake
gentlemen come to yourselves again
but i presaged thus much afore to you
would my lips had been solder'd when i spake on't
slight what moved you to be thus impertinent
my masters do not put on this strange face to pay my courtesy off with this visor
have good turns done you and thank 'em this way
'fore heav'n you have undone me
that which i have plotted for and been maturing now these four months you have blasted in a minute now i am lost i may speak
this gentlewoman was lodged here by me o' purpose and to be put upon my uncle hath profest this obstinate silence for my sake being my entire friend and one that for the requital of such a fortune as to marry him would have made me very ample conditions where now all my hopes are utterly miscarried by this unlucky accident
thus 'tis when a man will be ignorantly officious do services and not know his why i wonder what courteous itch possest you
you never did absurder part in your life nor a greater trespass to friendship or humanity
faith you may forgive it best 'twas your cause principally
i know it would it had not
the best the happiest that ever was sir
there has been a mad gentleman with your uncle this morning i think this be the gentleman that has almost talk'd him out of his wits with threatening him from marriage on i prithee
and your uncle sir he thinks 'twas done by your procurement therefore he will see the party you wot of presently and if he like her he says and that she be so inclining to dumb as i have told him he swears he will marry her to day instantly and not defer it a minute longer
by this light i knew it would be thus
nay sweet truewit forgive me
no i was ignorantly officious impertinent this was the absurd weak part
wilt thou ascribe that to merit now was mere fortune
fortune had not a finger in't
i saw it must necessarily in nature fall out so my genius is never false to me in these things
shew me how it could be otherwise
nay gentlemen contend not 'tis well now
alas i let him go on with inconsiderate and rash and what he pleas'd
away thou strange justifier of thyself to be wiser than thou wert by the event
by this light thou shalt never persuade me but i foresaw it as well as the stars themselves
nay gentlemen 'tis well now
do you two entertain sir john daw with discourse while i send her away with instructions
i will be acquainted with her first by your favour
master true wit lady a friend of ours
i am sorry i have not known you sooner lady to celebrate this rare virtue of your silence
faith an you had come sooner you should have seen and heard her well celebrated in sir john daw's madrigals
jack daw god save you
when saw you la foole
not since last night master truewit
i thought you two had been inseparable
he is gone to invite his guests
what a false memory have i towards that man
i am one i met him even now upon that he calls his delicate fine black horse rid into a foam with posting from place to place and person to person to give them the cue lest they should forget
yes there was never poor captain took more pains at a muster to shew men than he at this meal to shew friends
it is his quarter feast sir
do you say so sir john
nay jack daw will not be out at the best friends he has to the talent of his wit where's his mistress to hear and applaud him
is mistress epicoene gone
gone afore with sir dauphine i warrant to the place
that were a manifest injury a disgrace and a half to refuse him at such a festival time as this being a bravery and a wit too
tut he'll swallow it like cream he's better read in jure civili than to esteem any thing a disgrace is offer'd him from a mistress
nay let her e'en go she shall sit alone and be dumb in her chamber a week together for john daw i warrant her
does she refuse me
no sir do not take it so to heart she does not refuse you but a little neglects you
good faith truewit you were to blame to put it into his head that she does refuse him
sir she does refuse him palpably however you mince it
an i were as he i would swear to speak ne'er a word to her to day for't
by this light no more i will not
nor to any body else sir
nay i will not say so gentlemen
it had been an excellent happy condition for the company if you could have drawn him to it
i'll be very melancholy i'faith
as a dog if i were as you sir john
or a snail or a hog louse i would roll myself up for this day in troth they should not unwind me
by this pick tooth so i will
'tis well done he begins already to be angry with his teeth
will you go gentlemen
nay you must walk alone if you be right melancholy sir john
yes sir we'll dog you we'll follow you afar off
was there ever such a two yards of knighthood measured out by time to be sold to laughter
a mere talking mole hang him
no mushroom was ever so fresh
a fellow so utterly nothing as he knows not what he would be
let's follow him but first let's go to dauphine he's hovering about the house to hear what news
draw near with your fair charge and in her ear softly entreat her to unmasthey
is the door shut
now cutbeard with the same discipline i use to my family i will question you
as i conceive cutbeard this gentlewoman is she you have provided and brought in hope she will fit me in the place and person of a wife
answer me not but with your leg unless it be otherwise a very well done cutbeard
i conceive besides cutbeard you have been pre acquainted with her birth education and qualities or else you would not prefer her to my acceptance in the weighty consequence of marriage
a this i conceive cutbeard
answer me not but with your leg unless it be otherwise
very well done cutbeard
give aside now a little and leave me to examine her condition and aptitude to my affection
she is exceeding fair and of a special good favour a sweet composition or harmony of limbs her temper of beauty has the true height of my blood
the knave hath exceedingly well fitted me without i will now try her within
come near fair gentlewoman let not my behaviour seem rude though unto you being rare it may haply appear strange
nay lady you may speak though cutbeard and my man might not for of all sounds only the sweet voice of a fair lady has the just length of mine ears
i beseech you say lady out of the first fire of meeting eyes they say love is stricken do you feel any such motion suddenly shot into you from any part you see in me
alas lady these answers by silent curtsies from you are too courtless and simple
i have ever had my breeding in court and she that shall be my wife must be accomplished with courtly and audacious ornaments
can you speak lady
what say you lady
speak out i beseech you
on my judgment a divine softness
but can you naturally lady as i enjoin these by doctrine and industry refer yourself to the search of my judgment and not taking pleasure in your tongue which is a woman's chiefest pleasure think it plausible to answer me by silent gestures so long as my speeches jump right with what you conceive
if it were possible she should hold out thus
peace cutbeard thou art made for ever as thou hast made me if this felicity have lasting but i will try her further
dear lady i am courtly i tell you and i must have mine ears banqueted with pleasant and witty conferences pretty girls scoffs and dalliance in her that i mean to choose for my bed phere
the ladies in court think it a most desperate impair to their quickness of wit and good carriage if they cannot give occasion for a man to court 'em and when an amorous discourse is set on foot minister as good matter to continue it as himself and do you alone so much differ from all them that what they with so much circumstance affect and toil for to seem learn'd to seem judicious to seem sharp and conceited you can bury in yourself with silence and rather trust your graces to the fair conscience of virtue than to the world's or your own proclamation
i should be sorry else
what say you lady
good lady speak out
i should be sorry else
that sorrow doth fill me with gladness
o morose thou art happy above mankind
pray that thou mayest contain thyself
i will only put her to it once more and it shall be with the utmost touch and test of their sex
but hear me fair lady i do also love to see her whom i shall choose for my heifer to be the first and principal in all fashions precede all the dames at court by a fortnight have council of tailors lineners lace women embroiderers and sit with them sometimes twice a day upon french intelligences and then come forth varied like nature or oftener than she and better by the help of art her emulous servant
this do i affect and how will you be able lady with this frugality of speech to give the manifold but necessary instructions for that bodice these sleeves those skirts this cut that stitch this embroidery that lace this wire those knots that ruff those roses this girdle that fanne the t'other scarf these gloves
what say you lady
i'll leave it to you sir
pray you rise a note
i leave it to wisdom and you sir
i will trouble you no more i will not sin against so sweet a simplicity
let me now be bold to print on those divine lips the seal of being mine
cutbeard i give thee the lease of thy house free thank me not but with thy leg i know what thou wouldst say she's poor and her friends deceased
she has brought a wealthy dowry in her silence cutbeard and in respect of her poverty cutbeard i shall have her more loving and obedient cutbeard
go thy ways and get me a minister presently with a soft low voice to marry us and pray him he will not be impertinent but brief as he can away softly sirrah conduct your mistress into the dining room your now mistress
how i shall be revenged on mine insolent kinsman and his plots to fright me from marrying
this night i will get an heir and thrust him out of my blood like a stranger he would be knighted forsooth and thought by that means to reign over me his title must do it no kinsman i will now make you bring me the tenth lord's and the sixteenth lady's letter kinsman and it shall do you no good kinsman
your knighthood itself shall come on its knees and it shall be rejected it shall be sued for its fees to execution and not be redeem'd it shall cheat at the twelvepenny ordinary it knighthood for its diet all the term time and tell tales for it in the vacation to the hostess or it knighthood shall do worse take sanctuary in cole harbour and fast
it shall fright all its friends with borrowing letters and when one of the fourscore hath brought it knighthood ten shillings it knighthood shall go to the cranes or the bear at the bridge foot and be drunk in fear it shall not have money to discharge one tavern reckoning to invite the old creditors to forbear it knighthood or the new that should be to trust it knighthood
it shall be the tenth name in the bond to take up the commodity of pipkins and stone jugs and the part thereof shall not furnish it knighthood forth for the attempting of a baker's widow a brown baker's widow
it shall give it knighthood's name for a stallion to all gamesome citizens' wives and be refused when the master of a dancing school or how do you call him the worst reveller in the town is taken it shall want clothes and by reason of that wit to fool to lawyers
it shall not have hope to repair itself by constantinople ireland or virginia but the best and last fortune to it knighthood shall be to make dol tear sheet or kate common a lady and so it knighthood may eat
a are you sure he is not gone by
no i staid in the shop ever since
but he may take the other end of the lane
no i told him i would be here at this end i appointed him hither
what a barbarian it is to stay then
and his charge left behind him which is a very good sign dauphine
succeeds it or no
past imagination sir omnia secunda you could not have pray'd to have had it so well
saltat senex as it is in the proverb he does triumph in his felicity admires the party
he has given me the lease of my house too
and i am now going for a silent minister to marry them and away
'slight get one of the silenced ministers a zealous brother would torment him purely
o by no means let's do nothing to hinder it now when it is done and finished i am for you for any device of vexation
and that shall be within this half hour upon my dexterity gentlemen
contrive what you can in the mean time bonis avibus
how the slave doth latin it
it would be made a jest to posterity sirs this day's mirth if ye will
beshrew his heart that will not i pronounce
and for my part
to translate all la foole's company and his feast thither to day to celebrate this bride ale
ay marry but how will't be done
i'll undertake the directing of all the lady guests thither and then the meat must follow
for god's sake let's effect it it will be an excellent comedy of affliction so many several noises
but are they not at the other place already think you
i'll warrant you for the college honours one of their faces has not the priming colour laid on yet nor the other her smock sleek'd
o but they'll rise earlier then ordinary to a feast
best go see and assure ourselves
who knows the house
i will lead you were you never there yet
not nor where have you lived then
not know tom otter
no for god's sake what is he
an excellent animal equal with your daw or la foole if not transcendant and does latin it as much as your barber he is his wife's subject he calls her princess and at such times as these follows her up and down the house like a page with his hat off partly for heat partly for reverence
at this instant he is marshalling of his bull bear and horse
what be those in the name of sphynx
why sir he has been a great man at the bear garden in his time and from that subtle sport has ta'en the witty denomination of his chief carousing cups
one he calls his bull another his bear another his horse
and then he has his lesser glasses that he calls his deer and his ape and several degrees of them too and never is well nor thinks any entertainment perfect till these be brought out and set on the cupboard
we should miss this if we should not go
nay he has a thousand things as good that will speak him all day
he will rail on his wife with certain common places behind her back and to her face no more of him
let's go see him i petition you
a nay good princess hear me pauca verba
by that light i'll have you chain'd up with your bull dogs and bear dogs if you be not civil the sooner
i will send you to kennel i'faith
you were best bait me with your bull bear and horse
never a time that the courtiers or collegiates come to the house but you make it a shrove tuesday
i would have you get your whitsuntide velvet cap and your staff in your hand to entertain them yes in troth do
not so princess neither but under correction sweet princess give me leave
these things i am known to the courtiers by it is reported to them for my humour and they receive it so and do expect it
tom otter's bull bear and horse is known all over england in rerum natura
'fore me i will na ture them over to paris garden and na ture you thither too if you pronounce them again
is a bear a fit beast or a bull to mix in society with great ladies
think in your discretion in any good policy
the horse then good princess
well i am contented for the horse they love to be well horsed i know
i love it myself
and it is a delicate fine horse this
under correction princess jupiter did turn himself into a taurus or bull under correction good princess
by my integrity i will send you over to the bank side i will commit you to the master of the garden if i hear but a syllable more
must my house or my roof be polluted with the scent of bears and bulls when it is perfumed for great ladies
is this according to the instrument when i married you
that i would be princess and reign in mine own house and you would be my subject and obey me
what did you bring me should make you thus peremptory
do i allow you your half crown a day to spend where you will among your gamsters to vex and torment me at such times as these
who gives you your maintenance i pray you
who allows you your horse meat and man's meat
your three suits of apparel a year
your four pair of stockings one silk three worsted
your clean linen your bands and cuffs when i can get you to wear them
'tis marle you have them on now
who graces you with courtiers or great personages to speak to you out of their coaches and come home to your house
were you ever so much as look'd upon by a lord or a lady before i married you but on the easter or whitsun holidays
and then out at the banquetting house window when ned whiting or george stone were at the stake
for gods sake let's go stave her off him
answer me to that
and did not i take you up from thence in an old greasy buff doublet with points and green velvet sleeves out at the elbows
she'll worry him if we help not in time
o here are some of the gallants
go to behave yourself distinctly and with good morality or i protest i will take away your exhibition
by your leave fair mistress otter i will be bold to enter these gentlemen in your acquaintance
it shall not be obnoxious or difficil sir
how does my noble captain
is the bull bear and horse in rerum natura still
sir sic visum superis
i would you would but intimate them do
go your ways in and get toasts and butter made for the woodcocks
that's a fit province for you
alas what a tyranny is this poor fellow married to
o but the sport will be anon when we get him loose
dares he ever speak
no anabaptist ever rail'd with the like license but mark her language in the mean time i beseech you
gentlemen you are very aptly come
my cousin sir amorous will be here briefly
in good time lady
was not sir john daw here to ask for him and the company
i cannot assure you master truewit
here was a very melancholy knight in a ruff that demanded my subject for somebody a gentleman i think
ay that was he lady
but he departed straight i can resolve you
what an excellent choice phrase this lady expresses in
o sir she is the only authentical courtier that is not naturally bred one in the city
you have taken that report upon trust gentlemen
no i assure you the court governs it so lady in your behalf
i am the servant of the court and courtiers sir
they are rather your idolaters
o no sir omnia bene
'twas never better on the hinges all's sure
i have so pleased him with a curate that he's gone to't almost with the delight he hopes for soon
what is he for a vicar
one that has catch'd a cold sir and can scarce be heard six inches off as if he spoke out of a bulrush that were not pick'd or his throat were full of pith a fine quick fellow and an excellent barber of prayers
i came to tell you sir that you might omnem movere lapidem as they say be ready with your vexation
be thereabouts with thy key to let us in
i will not fail you sir ad manum
well i'll go watch my coaches
do and we'll send daw to you if you meet him not
is master truewit gone
yes lady there is some unfortunate business fallen out
so i adjudged by the physiognomy of the fellow that came in and i had a dream last night too of a new pageant and my lady mayoress which is always very ominous to me
i told it my lady haughty t'other day when her honour came hither to see some china stuffs and she expounded it out of artemidorus and i have found it since very true
it has done me many affronts
yes sir any thing i do but dream of the city
it stain'd me a damasque table cloth cost me eighteen pound at one time and burnt me a black satin gown as i stood by the fire at my lady centaure's chamber in the college another time
a third time at the lord's masque it dropt all my wire and my ruff with wax candle that i could not go up to the banquet
a fourth time as i was taking coach to go to ware to meet a friend it dash'd me a new suit all over a crimson satin doublet and black velvet skirts with a brewer's horse that i was fain to go in and shift me and kept my chamber a leash of days for the anguish of it
these were dire mischances lady
i would not dwell in the city an 'twere so fatal to me
yes sir but i do take advice of my doctor to dream of it as little as i can
you do well mistress otter
will it please you to enter the house farther gentlemen
and your favour lady but we stay to speak with a knight sir john daw who is here come
we shall follow you lady
at your own time sir
it is my cousin sir amorous his feast i know it lady
but it is for his honour and therefore i take no name of it more than of the place
you are a bounteous kinswoman
why do not you know it sir john daw
no i am a rook if i do
i'll tell you then she's married by this time
and whereas you were put in the head that she was gone with sir dauphine i assure you sir dauphine has been the noblest honestest friend to you that ever gentleman of your quality could boast of
he has discover'd the whole plot and made your mistress so acknowledging and indeed so ashamed of her injury to you that she desires you to forgive her and but grace her wedding with your presence to day she is to be married to a very good fortune she says his uncle old morose and she will'd me in private to tell you that she shall be able to do you more favours and with more security now than before
did she say so i'faith
why what do you think of me sir john
nay i believe you
good sir dauphine did she desire me to forgive her
i assure you sir john she did
nay then i do with all my heart and i'll be jovial
yes for look you sir this was the injury to you
la foole intended this feast to honour her bridal day and made you the property to invite the college ladies and promise to bring her and then at the time she should have appear'd as his friend to have given you the dor
whereas now sir dauphine has brought her to a feeling of it with this kind of satisfaction that you shall bring all the ladies to the place where she is and be very jovial and there she will have a dinner which shall be in your name and so disappoint la foole to make you good again and as it were a saver in the main
as i am a knight i honour her and forgive her heartily
about it then presently
truewit is gone before to confront the coaches and to acquaint you with so much if he meet you
join with him and 'tis well
see here comes your antagonist but take you no notice but be very jovial
f are the ladies come sir john daw and your mistress
you are exceeding welcome and honest master clerimont
did you see no collegiates gentlemen
do you not hear sir amorous how you are abus'd
will you speak so kindly to sir john daw that has done you such an affront
let me be a suitor to you to know i beseech you
why sir his mistress is married to day to sir dauphine's uncle your cousin's neighbour and he has diverted all the ladies and all your company thither to frustrate your provision and stick a disgrace upon you
he was here now to have enticed us away from you too but we told him his own i think
f has sir john daw wrong'd me so inhumanly
he has done it sir amorous most maliciously and treacherously but if youll be ruled by us you shall quit him i'faith
f good gentlemen i'll make one believe it
marry sir get me your pheasants and your godwits and your best meat and dish it in silver dishes of your cousin's presently and say nothing but clap me a clean towel about you like a sewer and bare headed march afore it with a good confidence 'tis but over the way hard by and we'll second you where you shall set it on the board and bid them welcome to't which shall shew 'tis yours and disgrace his preparation utterly and for your cousin whereas she should be troubled here at home with care of making and giving welcome she shall transfer all that labour thither and be a principal guest herself sit rank'd with the college honours and be honour'd and have her health drunk as often as bare and as loud as the best of them
f i'll go tell her presently
it shall be done that's resolved
i thought he would not hear it out but 'twould take him
well there be guests and meat now how shall we do for music
the smell of the venison going through the street will invite one noise of fiddlers or other
i would it would call the trumpeters hither
faith there is hope they have intelligence of all feasts
there's good correspondence betwixt them and the london cooks 'tis twenty to one but we have them
'twill be a most solemn day for my uncle and an excellent fit of mirth for us
ay if we can hold up the emulation betwixt foole and daw and never bring them to expostulate
tut flatter them both as truewit says and you may take their understandings in a purse net
they'll believe themselves to be just such men as we make them neither more nor less
they have nothing not the use of their senses but by tradition
sir amorous has his towel on already
have you persuaded your cousin
f yes 'tis very feasible she'll do any thing she says rather than the la fooles shall be disgraced
she is a noble kinswoman
it will be such a pestling device sir amorous it will pound all your enemy's practices to powder and blow him up with his own mine his own train
f nay we'll give fire i warrant you
but you must carry it privately without any noise and take no notice by any means gentlemen my princess says you shall have all her silver dishes festinate and she's gone to alter her tire a little and go with you and yourself too captain otter
by any means sir
yes sir i do mean it but i would entreat my cousin sir amorous and you gentlemen to be suitors to my princess that i may carry my bull and my bear as well as my horse
that you shall do captain otter
f my cousin will never consent gentlemen
she must consent sir amorous to reason
f why she says they are no decorum among ladies
but they are decora and that's better sir
ay she must hear argument
did not pasiphae who was a queen love a bull
and was not calisto the mother of arcas turn'd into a bear and made a star mistress ursula in the heavens
that i could have said as much
i will have these stories painted in the bear garden ex ovidii metamorphosi
where is your princess captain
pray be our leader
that i shall sir
make haste good sir amorous
a sir there is an angel for yourself and a brace of angels for your cold
muse not at this manage of my bounty
it is fit we should thank fortune double to nature for any benefit she confers upon us besides it is your imperfection but my solace
a i thank your worship so is it mine now
what says he cutbeard
he says praesto sir whensoever your worship needs him he can be ready with the like
he got this cold with sitting up late and singing catches with cloth workers
god keep your worship and give you much joy with your fair spouse
let him give me five shillings of my money back
as it is bounty to reward benefits so is it equity to mulct injuries
i will have it
he cannot change it sir
it must be changed
he will cough out the rest sir
away away with him
fie master morose that you will use this violence to a man of the church
it does not become your gravity or breeding as you pretend in court to have offer'd this outrage on a waterman or any more boisterous creature much less on a man of his civil coat
you can speak then
speak out i mean
why did you think you had married a statue or a motion only
one of the french puppets with the eyes turn'd with a wire
or some innocent out of the hospital that would stand with her hands thus and a plaise mouth and look upon you
nay never quarrel with cutbeard sir it is too late now
i confess it doth bate somewhat of the modesty i had when i writ simply maid but i hope i shall make it a stock still competent to the estate and dignity of your wife
none of my knaves there
where is this impostor cutbeard
speak to him fellow speak to him
i'll have none of this coacted unnatural dumbness in my house in a family where i govern
she is my regent already
i have married a penthesilea a semiramis sold my liberty to a distaff
is he come again
lord have mercy upon me
i wish you all joy mistress epicoene with your grave and honourable match
i return you the thanks master truewit so friendly a wish deserves
she has acquaintance too
god save you sir and give you all contentment in your fair choice here
before i was the bird of night to you the owl but now i am the messenger of peace a dove and bring you the glad wishes of many friends to the celebration of this good hour
your marriage hour sir
i commend your resolution that notwithstanding all the dangers i laid afore you in the voice of a night crow would yet go on and be yourself
it shews you are a man constant to your own ends and upright to your purposes that would not be put off with left handed cries
how should you arrive at the knowledge of so much
why did you ever hope sir committing the secrecy of it to a barber that less then the whole town should know it
you might as well have told it the conduit or the bake house or the infantry that follow the court and with more security
could your gravity forget so old and noted a remnant as lippis et tonsoribus notum
well sir forgive it yourself now the fault and be communicable with your friends
here will be three or four fashionable ladies from the college to visit you presently and their train of minions and followers
where are all my eaters
bar up my doors you varlets
he is a varlet that stirs to such an office
let them stand open
i would see him that dares move his eyes toward it
shall i have a barricado made against my friends to be barr'd of any pleasure they can bring in to me with their honourable visitation
nay faith in this sir she speaks but reason and methinks is more continent than you
would you go to bed so presently sir afore noon
a man of your head and hair should owe more to that reverend ceremony and not mount the marriage bed like a town bull or a mountain goat but stay the due season and ascend it then with religion and fear
those delights are to be steeped in the humour and silence of the night and give the day to other open pleasures and jollities of feasting of music of revels of discourse we'll have all sir that may make your hymen high and happy
o my torment my torment
nay if you endure the first half hour sir so tediously and with this irksomness what comfort or hope can this fair gentlewoman make to herself hereafter in the consideration of so many years as are to come of my affliction
good sir depart and let her do it alone
i have done sir
yes faith a cursed wretch indeed sir
i have married his cittern that's common to all men
some plague above the plague all egypt's ten plagues
revenge me on him
'tis very well sir
if you laid on a curse or two more i'll assure you he'll bear them
as that he may get the pox with seeking to cure it sir or that while he is curling another man's hair his own may drop off or for burning some male bawd's lock he may have his brain beat out with the curling iron
no let the wretch live wretched
may he get the itch and his shop so lousy as no man dare come at him nor he come at no man
ay and if he would swallow all his balls for pills let not them purge him
let his warming pan be ever cold
a perpetual frost underneath it sir
let him never hope to see fire again
but in hell sir
his chairs be always empty his scissors rust and his combs mould in their cases
and may he lose the invention sir of carving lanterns in paper
let there be no bawd carted that year to employ a bason of his but let him be glad to eat his sponge for bread
and drink lotium to it and much good do him
or for want of bread eat ear wax sir
or draw his own teeth and add them to the lute string
no beat the old ones to powder and make bread of them
yes make meal of the mill stones
may all the botches and burns that he has cured on others break out upon him
and he now forget the cure of them in himself sir or if he do remember it let him have scraped all his linen into lint for't and have not a rag left him to set up with
let him never set up again but have the gout in his hands for ever
now no more sir
o that last was too high set you might go less with him i'faith and be revenged enough as that he be never able to new paint his pole good sir no more i forgot myself
or want credit to take up with a comb maker no more sir
or having broken his glass in a former despair fall now into a much greater of ever getting another i beseech you no more
or that he never be trusted with trimming of any but chimney sweepers sir or may he cut a collier's throat with his razor by chance medley and yet be hanged for't
i will forgive him rather than hear any more
i beseech you sir
o the sea breaks in upon me
i shall be overwhelmed with noise
it beats already at my shores
i feel an earthquake in my self for't
'give you joy mistress
has she servants too
i have brought some ladies here to see and know you
my lady haughty this my lady centaure mistress dol mavis mistress trusty my lady haughty's woman
let's see him can he endure no noise
let me come to him
what nomenclator is this
sir john daw sir your wife's servant this
a daw and her servant
o 'tis decreed 'tis decreed of me an she have such servants
nay sir you must kiss the ladies you must not go away now they come toward you to seek you out
i'faith master morose would you steal a marriage thus in the midst of so many friends and not acquaint us
well i'll kiss you notwithstanding the justice of my quarrel you shall give me leave mistress to use a becoming familiarity with your husband
your ladyship does me an honour in it to let me know he is so worthy your favour as you have done both him and me grace to visit so unprepared a pair to entertain you
but i must lay the burden of that upon my servant here
it shall not need mistress morose we will all bear rather than one shall be opprest
i know it and you will teach her the faculty if she be to learn it
is this the silent woman
nay she has found her tongue since she was married master truewit says
what kind of creature is your bride here
yes madam believe it she is a gentlewoman of very absolute behaviour and of a good race
and jack daw told us she could not speak
so it was carried in plot madam to put her upon this old fellow by sir dauphine his nephew and one or two more of us but she is a woman of an excellent assurance and an extraordinary happy wit and tongue
you shall see her make rare sport with daw ere night
and he brought us to laugh at her
that falls out often madam that he that thinks himself the master wit is the master fool
i assure your ladyship ye cannot laugh at her
no we'll have her to the college an she have wit she shall be one of us shall she not centaure
we'll make her a collegiate
yes faith madam and mistress mavis and she will set up a side
believe it madam and mistress mavis she will sustain her part
i'll tell you that when i have talk'd with her and tried her
use her very civilly mavis
so i will madam
that they would whisper thus ever
in the mean time madam would but your ladyship help to vex him a little you know his disease talk to him about the wedding ceremonies or call for your gloves or let me alone
master bridegroom where are you
o it was too miraculously good to last
we see no ensigns of a wedding here no character of a bride ale where be our scarves and our gloves
i pray you give them us
let us know your bride's colours and yours at least
alas madam he has provided none
had i known your ladyship's painter i would
he has given it you centaure i'faith
but do you hear master morose
a jest will not absolve you in this manner
you that have suck'd the milk of the court and from thence have been brought up to the very strong meats and wine of it been a courtier from the biggen to the night cap as we may say and you to offend in such a high point of ceremony as this and let your nuptials want all marks of solemnity
how much plate have you lost to day if you had but regarded your profit what gifts what friends through your mere rusticity
madam pardon me sir i must insinuate your errors to you no gloves
yes madam i'll make an epithalamium i promise my mistress i have begun it already will you ladyship hear it
ay good jack daw
will it please your ladyship command a chamber and be private with your friend
you shall have your choice of rooms to retire to after my whole house is yours
i know it hath been your ladyship's errand into the city at other times however now you have been unhappily diverted upon me but i shall be loth to break any honourable custom of your ladyship's
and therefore good madam come you are a rude bridegroom to entertain ladies of honour in this fashion
he is a rude groom indeed
by that light you deserve to be grafted and have your horns reach from one side of the island to the other
do not mistake me sir i but speak this to give the ladies some heart again not for any malice to you
is this your bravo ladies
as god shall help me if you utter such another word i'll take mistress bride in and begin to you in a very sad cup do you see
go to know your friends and such as love you
a by your leave ladies
do you want any music
i have brought you variety of noises
play sirs all of you
o a plot a plot a plot a plot upon me
this day i shall be their anvil to work on they will grate me asunder
'tis worse then the noise of a saw
no they are hair rosin and guts
i can give you the receipt
you see who's your friend now sir take courage put on a martyr's resolution
mock down all their attemptings with patience 'tis but a day and i would suffer heroically
should an ass exceed me in fortitude
you betray your infirmity with your hanging dull ears and make them insult bear up bravely and constantly
a look you here sir what honour is done you unexpected by your nephew a wedding dinner come and a knight sewer before it for the more reputation and fine mistress otter your neighbour in the rump or tail of it
is that gorgon that medusa come
hide me hide me
i warrant you sir she will not transform you
look upon her with a good courage
pray you entertain her and conduct your guests in
mistress bride will you entreat in the ladies
your bride groom is so shame faced here
will it please your ladyship madam
with the benefit of your company mistress
servant pray you perform your duties
and glad to be commanded mistress
how like you her wit mavis
very prettily absolutely well
you shall pardon me mistress otter
why i am a collegiate
but not in ordinary
we'll dispute that within
would this had lasted a little longer
and that they had sent for the heralds
i have brought my bull bear and horse in private and yonder are the trumpeters without and the drum gentlemen
o o and we will have a rouse in each of them anon for bold britons i'faith
o o follow follow follow
a was there ever poor bridegroom so tormented
i have not read of the like in the chronicles of the land
sure he cannot but go to a place of rest after all this purgatory
he may presume it i think
the spitting the coughing the laughter the neezing the farting dancing noise of the music and her masculine and loud commanding and urging the whole family makes him think he has married a fury
and she carries it up bravely
ay she takes any occasion to speak that is the height on't
and how soberly dauphine labours to satisfy him that it was none of his plot
and has almost brought him to the faith in the article
where is he now
what's become of him dauphine
o hold me up a little i shall go away in the jest else
he has got on his whole nest of night caps and lock'd himself up in the top of the house as high as ever he can climb from the noise
i peep'd in at a cranny and saw him sitting over a cross beam of the roof like him on the sadler's horse in fleet street upright and he will sleep there
but where are your collegiates
withdrawn with the bride in private
o they are instructing her in the college grammar
if she have grace with them she knows all their secrets instantly
methinks the lady haughty looks well to day for all my dispraise of her in the morning
i think i shall come about to thee again truewit
believe it i told you right
women ought to repair the losses time and years have made in their features with dressings
and an intelligent woman if she know by herself the least defect will be most curious to hide it and it becomes her
if she be short let her sit much lest when she stands she be thought to sit
if she have an ill foot let her wear her gown the longer and her shoe the thinner
if a fat hand and scald nails let her carve the less and act in gloves
if a sour breath let her never discourse fasting and always talk at her distance
if she have black and rugged teeth let her offer the less at laughter especially if she laugh wide and open
o you shall have some women when they laugh you would think they brayed it is so rude and ay and others that will stalk in their gait like an estrich and take huge strides
i cannot endure such a sight
i love measure in the feet and number in the voice they are gentlenesses that oftentimes draw no less than the face
how camest thou to study these creatures so exactly
i would thou would'st make me a proficient
yes but you must leave to live in your chamber then a month together upon amadis de gaul or don quixote as you are wont and come abroad where the matter is frequent to court to tiltings public shows and feasts to plays and church sometimes thither they come to shew their new tires too to see and to be seen
in these places a man shall find whom to love whom to play with whom to touch once whom to hold ever
the variety arrests his judgment
a wench to please a man comes not down dropping from the ceiling as he lies on his back droning a tobacco pipe
he must go where she is
yes and be never the nearer
that diffidence makes thee worthy it should be so
he says true to you dauphine
a man should not doubt to overcome any woman
think he can vanquish them and he shall for though they deny their desire is to be tempted
penelope herself cannot hold out long
ostend you saw was taken at last
you must persever and hold to your purpose
they would solicit us but that they are afraid
howsoever they wish in their hearts we should solicit them
praise them flatter them you shall never want eloquence or trust even the chastest delight to feel themselves that way rubb'd
with praises you must mix kisses too if they take them they'll take more though they strive they would be overcome
o but a man must beware of force
it is to them an acceptable violence and has oft times the place of the greatest courtesy
she that might have been forced and you let her go free without touching though then she seem to thank you will ever hate you after and glad in the face is assuredly sad at the heart
but all women are not to be taken all ways
'tis true no more than all birds or all fishes
if you appear learned to an ignorant wench or jocund to a sad or witty to a foolish why she presently begins to mistrust herself
you must approach them in their own height their own line for the contrary makes many that fear to commit themselves to noble and worthy fellows run into the embraces of a rascal
if she love wit give verses though you borrow them of a friend or buy them to have good
if valour talk of your sword and be frequent in the mention of quarrels though you be staunch in fighting
if activity be seen on your barbary often or leaping over stools for the credit of your back
if she love good clothes or dressing have your learned council about you every morning your french tailor barber linener etc
let your powder your glass and your comb be your dearest acquaintance
take more care for the ornament of your head than the safety and wish the commonwealth rather troubled than a hair about you
that will take her
then if she be covetous and craving do you promise any thing and perform sparingly so shall you keep her in appetite still
seem as you would give but be like a barren field that yields little or unlucky dice to foolish and hoping gamesters
let your gifts be slight and dainty rather than precious
let cunning be above cost
give cherries at time of year or apricots and say they were sent you out of the country though you bought them in cheapside
admire her tires like her in all fashions compare her in every habit to some deity invent excellent dreams to flatter her and riddles or if she be a great one perform always the second parts to her like what she likes praise whom she praises and fail not to make the household and servants yours yea the whole family and salute them by their names 'tis but light cost if you can purchase them so and make her physician your pensioner and her chief woman
nor will it be out of your gain to make love to her too so she follow not usher her lady's pleasure
all blabbing is taken away when she comes to be a part of the crime
on what courtly lap hast thou late slept to come forth so sudden and absolute a courtling
good faith i should rather question you that are so harkening after these mysteries
i begin to suspect your diligence dauphine
speak art thou in love in earnest
yes by my troth am i 'twere ill dissembling before thee
with which of them i prithee
with all the collegiates
we'll keep you at home believe it in the stable if you be such a stallion
no i like him well
men should love wisely and all women some one for the face and let her please the eye another for the skin and let her please the touch a third for the voice and let her please the ear and where the objects mix let the senses so too
thou would'st think it strange if i should make them all in love with thee afore night
i would say thou had'st the best philtre in the world and couldst do more than madam medea or doctor foreman
if i do not let me play the mountebank for my meat while i live and the bawd for my drink
so be it i say
o lord gentlemen how my knights and i have mist you here
why captain what service
to see me bring up my bull bear and horse to fight
yes faith the captain says we shall be his dogs to bait them
come on let's see a course then
f i am afraid my cousin will be offended if she come
be afraid of nothing
gentlemen i have placed the drum and the trumpets and one to give them the sign when you are ready
here's my bull for myself and my bear for sir john daw and my horse for sir amorous
now set your foot to mine and yours to his and f pray god my cousin come not
saint george and saint andrew fear no cousins
et rauco strepuerunt cornua cantu
well said captain i'faith well fought at the bull
well held at the bear
o the horse has kick'd off his dog already
f i cannot drink it as i am a knight
off with his spurs somebody
f it goes against my conscience
my cousin will be angry with it
i have done mine
you fought high and fair sir john
like an excellent bear dog
you take no notice of the business i hope
not a word sir you see we are jovial
sir amorous you must not equivocate
it must be pull'd down for all my cousin
'sfoot if you take not your drink they will think you are discontented with something you'll betray all if you take the least notice
f not i i'll both drink and talk then
you must pull the horse on his knees sir amorous fear no cousins
o now he's in his vein and bold
the least hint given him of his wife now will make him rail desperately
speak to him of her
do you and i will fetch her to the hearing of it
captain he otter your she otter is coming your wife
there's no such thing in nature
i confess gentlemen i have a cook a laundress a house drudge that serves my necessary turns and goes under that title but he's an ass that will be so uxorious to tie his affections to one circle
come the name dulls appetite
here replenish again another bout
wives are nasty sluttish animalls
as ever the earth bare tribus verbis
he's slipt aside sir
but you must drink and be jovial
yes give it me
f and me too
f as jovial as you will
now you shall have the bear cousin and sir john daw the horse and i will have the bull still
sound tritons of the thames
nunc est bibendum nunc pede libero villains murderers sons of the earth and traitors what do you there
o now the trumpets have waked him we shall have his company
a wife is a scurvy clogdogdo an unlucky thing a very foresaid bear whelp without any good fashion or breeding mala bestia
why did you marry one then captain
i married with six thousand pound i was in love with that
i have not kissed my fury these forty weeks
the more to blame you captain
nay mistress otter hear him a little first
she has a breath worse than my grandmother's profecto
kiss me sweet master truewit and prove him a slandering knave
i will rather believe you lady
and she has a peruke that's like a pound of hemp made up in shoe threads
a most vile face
and yet she spends me forty pound a year in mercury and hogs bones
all her teeth were made in the black friars both her eyebrows in the strand and her hair in silver street
every part of the town owns a piece of her
she takes herself asunder still when she goes to bed into some twenty boxes and about next day noon is put together again like a great german clock and so comes forth and rings a tedious larum to the whole house and then is quiet again for an hour but for her quarters
have you done me right gentlemen
no sir i will do you right with my quarters with my quarters
o hold good princess
a battle a battle
you notorious stinkardly bearward does my breath smell
under correction dear princess look to my bear and my horse gentlemen
do i want teeth and eyebrows thou bull dog
no i protest under correction ay now you are under correction you protest but you did not protest before correction sir
thou judas to offer to betray thy princess
i will make thee an example i will have no such examples in my house lady otter
mistress mary ambree your examples are dangerous
rogues hell hounds stentors
out of my doors you sons of noise and tumult begot on an ill may day or when the galley foist is afloat to westminster
a trumpeter could not be conceived but then
what ails you sir
they have rent my roof walls and all my windows asunder with their brazen throats
best follow him dauphine
where's daw and la foole
they are both run away sir
good gentlemen help to pacify my princess and speak to the great ladies for me
now must i go lie with the bears this fortnight and keep out of the way till my peace be made for this scandal she has taken
did you not see my bull head gentlemen
is't not on captain
no but he may make a new one by that is on
o here it is
an you come over gentlemen and ask for tom otter we'll go down to ratcliff and have a course i'faith for all these disasters
there is bona spes left
away captain get off while you are well
i am glad we are rid of him
you had never been unless we had put his wife upon him
his humour is as tedious at last as it was ridiculous at first
a we wonder'd why you shriek'd so mistress otter
o lord madam he came down with a huge long naked weapon in both his hands and look'd so dreadfully
sure he's beside himself
why what made you there mistress otter
alas mistress mavis i was chastising my subject and thought nothing of him
faith mistress you must do so too learn to chastise
mistress otter corrects her husband so he dares not speak but under correction
f and with his hat off to her 'twould do you good to see
in sadness 'tis good and mature counsel practise it morose
i'll call you morose still now as i call centaure and mavis we four will be all one
and you will come to the college and live with us
make him give milk and honey
look how you manage him at first you shall have him ever after
let him allow you your coach and four horses your woman your chamber maid your page your gentleman usher your french cook and four grooms
and go with us to bedlam to the china houses and to the exchange
it will open the gate to your fame
here's centaure has immortalised herself with taming of her wild male
ay she has done the miracle of the kingdom
but ladies do you count it lawful to have such plurality of servants and do them all graces
why should women deny their favours to men
are they the poorer or the worse
is the thames the less for the dyer's water mistress
f or a torch for lighting many torches
well said la foole what a new one he has got
they are empty losses women fear in this kind
besides ladies should be mindful of the approach of age and let no time want his due use
the best of our days pass first
we are rivers that cannot be call'd back madam she that now excludes her lovers may live to lie a forsaken beldame in a frozen bed
'tis true mavis and who will wait on us to coach then
or write or tell us the news then make anagrams of our names and invite us to the cockpit and kiss our hands all the play time and draw their weapons for our honours
nay my mistress is not altogether unintelligent of these things here be in presence have tasted of her favours
what a neighing hobby horse is this
but not with intent to boast them again servant
and have you those excellent receipts madam to keep yourselves from bearing of children
o yes morose how should we maintain our youth and beauty else
many births of a woman make her old as many crops make the earth barren
o my cursed angel that instructed me to this fate
that i should be seduced by so foolish a devil as a barber will make
i would i had been worthy sir to have partaken your counsel you should never have trusted it to such a minister
would i could redeem it with the loss of an eye nephew a hand or any other member
marry god forbid sir that you should geld yourself to anger your wife
so it would rid me of her
and that i did supererogatory penance in a belfry at westminster hall in the cock pit at the fall of a stag the tower wharf what place is there else
london bridge paris garden billinsgate when the noises are at their height and loudest
nay i would sit out a play that were nothing but fights at sea drum trumpet and target
i hope there shall be no such need sir
take patience good uncle
this is but a day and 'tis well worn too now
o 'twill be so for ever nephew i foresee it for ever
strife and tumult are the dowry that comes with a wife
i told you so sir and you would not believe me
alas do not rub those wounds master truewit to blood again 'twas my negligence
add not affliction to affliction
i have perceived the effect of it too late in madam otter
how do you sir
did you ever hear a more unnecessary question
as if she did not see
why i do as you see empress empress
you are not well sir you look very ill something has distemper'd you
o horrible monstrous impertinencies
would not one of these have served do you think sir
would not one of these have served
yes sir but these are but notes of female kindness sir certain tokens that she has a voice sir
o is it so
come an't be no otherwise what say you
how do you feel yourself sir
nay look you sir you would be friends with your wife upon unconscionable terms her silence they say you are run mad sir
not for love i assure you of you do you see
lay hold on him for god's sake
what shall i do
who's his physician can you tell that knows the state of his body best that i might send for him
good sir speak i'll send for one of my doctors else
what to poison me that i might die intestate and leave you possest of all
lord how idly he talks and how his eyes sparkle
he looks green about the temples
do you see what blue spots he has
gentlemen for heaven's sake counsel me
ladies servant you have read pliny and paracelsus ne'er a word now to comfort a poor gentlewoman
ay me what fortune had i to marry a distracted man
i will tell you mistress how rarely she holds it up
what mean you gentlemen
what will you tell me servant
the disease in greek is called mania in latin insania furor vel ecstasis melancholica that is egressio when a man ex melancholico evadit fanaticus
shall i have a lecture read upon me alive
but he may be but phreneticus yet mistress
and phrenetis is only delirium or so
ay that is for the disease servant but what is this to the cure
we are sure enough of the disease
why we'll entreat her to hold her peace sir
o no labour not to stop her
she is like a conduit pipe that will gush out with more force when she opens again
i will tell you morose you must talk divinity to him altogether or moral philosophy
f ay and there's an excellent book of moral philosophy madam of raynard the fox and all the beasts called doni's philosophy
there is indeed sir amorous la foole
f i have read it my lady centaure all over to my cousin here
ay and 'tis a very good book as any is of the moderns
tut he must have seneca read to him and plutarch and the ancients the moderns are not for this disease
why you discommended them too to day sir john
ay in some cases but in these they are best and aristotle's ethics
say you so sir john
i think you are decived you took it upon trust
where's trusty my woman
i'll end this difference
i prithee otter call her
her father and mother were both mad when they put her to me
nay gentlemen i am tame
this is but an exercise i know a marriage ceremony which i must endure
and one of them i know not which was cur'd with the sick man's salve and the other with green's groat's worth of wit
a very cheap cure madam
ay 'tis very feasible
my lady call'd for you mistress trusty you must decide a controversy
o trusty which was it you said your father or your mother that was cured with the sick man's salve
my mother madam with the salve
then it was the sick woman's salve
and my father with the groat's worth of wit
but there was other means used we had a preacher that would preach folk asleep still and so they were prescribed to go to church by an old woman that was their physician thrice a week to sleep
yes forsooth and every night they read themselves asleep on those books
good faith it stands with great reason
i would i knew where to procure those books
f i can help you with one of them mistress morose the groat's worth of wit
but i shall disfurnish you sir amorous can you spare it
f o yes for a week or so i'll read it myself to him
no i must do that sir that must be my office
sure he would do well enough if he could sleep
no i should do well enough if you could sleep
have i no friend that will make her drunk
or give her a little laudanum
why sir she talks ten times worse in her sleep
do you not know that sir
never ceases all night
and snores like a porpoise
o redeem me fate redeem me fate
for how many causes may a man be divorced nephew
i know not truly sir
some divine must resolve you in that sir or canon lawyer
i will not rest i will not think of any other hope or comfort till i know
you'll make him mad indeed ladies if you pursue this
no we'll let him breathe now a quarter of an hour or so
by my faith a large truce
is that his keeper that is gone with him
it is his nephew madam
f sir dauphine eugenie
he looks like a very pitiful knight as can be
this marriage has put him out of all
f he has not a penny in his purse madam
he is ready to cry all this day
f a very shark he set me in the nick t'other night at primero
how these swabbers talk
ay otter's wine has swell'd their humours above a spring tide
good morose let us go in again
i like your couches exceeding well we will go lie and talk there
i wait on you madam
'slight i will have them as silent as signs and their post too ere i have done
do you hear lady bride
i pray thee now as thou art a noble wench continue this discourse of dauphine within but praise him exceedingly magnify him with all the height of affection thou canst i have some purpose in't and but beat off these two rooks jack daw and his fellow with any discontentment hither and i'll honour thee for ever
i was about it here
it angered me to the soul to hear them begin to talk so malepert
pray thee perform it and thou winn'st me an idolater to thee everlasting
will you go in and hear me do't
no i'll stay here
drive them out of your company 'tis all i ask which cannot be any way better done than by extolling dauphine whom they have so slighted
i warrant you you shall expect one of them presently
what a cast of kestrils are these to hawk after ladies thus
ay and strike at such an eagle as dauphine
he will be mad when we tell him
o sir you are welcome
run out of doors in his night caps to talk with a casuist about his divorce
thou wouldst have said so if thou hadst been here
the ladies have laugh'd at thee most comically since thou went'st dauphine
and ask'd if thou wert thine uncle's keeper
and the brace of baboons answer'd yes and said thou wert a pitiful poor fellow and didst live upon posts and hadst nothing but three suits of apparel and some few benevolences that lords gave thee to fool to them and swagger
let me not live i will beat them i'll bind them both to grand madam's bed posts and have them baited with monkies
thou shalt not need they shall be beaten to thy hand dauphine
i have an execution to serve upon them i warrant thee shall serve trust my plot
ay you have many plots
so you had one to make all the wenches in love with me
why if i do not yet afore night as near as 'tis and that they do not every one invite thee and be ready to scratch for thee take the mortgage of my wit
'fore god i'll be his witness thou shalt have it dauphine thou shalt be his fool for ever if thou doest not
perhaps 'twill be the better estate
do you observe this gallery or rather lobby indeed
here are a couple of studies at each end one here will i act such a tragi comedy between the guelphs and the ghibellines daw and la foole which of them comes out first will i seize on you two shall be the chorus behind the arras and whip out between the acts and speak if i do not make them keep the peace for this remnant of the day if not of the year i have failed once i hear daw coming hide and do not laugh for god's sake
which is the way into the garden trow
i am glad i have met with you
in good faith i must have this matter go no further between you
i must have it taken up
come you disguise it sir amorous and you
if you love me jack you shall make use of your philosophy now for this once and deliver me your sword
this is not the wedding the centaurs were at though there be a she one here
the bride has entreated me i will see no blood shed at her bridal you saw her whisper me erewhile
as i hope to finish tacitus i intend no murder
do you not wait for sir amorous
not i by my knighthood
and your scholarship too
and my scholarship too
go to then i return you your sword and ask you mercy but put it not up for you will be assaulted
i understood that you had apprehended it and walked here to brave him and that you had held your life contemptible in regard of your honour
no no no such thing i assure you
he and i parted now as good friends as could be
trust not you to that visor
i saw him since dinner with another face i have known many men in my time vex'd with losses with deaths and with abuses but so offended a wight as sir amorous did i never see or read of
for taking away his guests sir to day that's the cause and he declares it behind your back with such threatenings and contempts he said to dauphine you were the arrant'st ass ay he may say his pleasure
and swears you are so protested a coward that he knows you will never do him any manly or single right and therefore he will take his course
i'll give him any satisfaction sir but fighting
ay sir but who knows what satisfaction he'll take
blood he thirsts for and blood he will have and whereabouts on you he will have it who knows but himself
i pray you master truewit be you a mediator
well sir conceal yourself then in this study till i return
nay you must be content to be lock'd in for for mine own reputation i would not have you seen to receive a public disgrace while i have the matter in managing
ods so here he comes keep your breath close that he do not hear you sigh
in good faith sir amorous he is not this way i pray you be merciful do not murder him he is a christian as good as you you are arm'd as if you sought revenge on all his race
good dauphine get him away from this place
i never knew a man's choler so high but he would speak to his friends he would hear reason
within is he gone master truewit
ay did you hear him
what a quick ear fear has
but is he so arm'd as you say
did you ever see a fellow set out to take possession
that may give you some light to conceive of him but 'tis nothing to the principal
some false brother in the house has furnish'd him strangely or if it were out of the house it was tom otter
indeed he's a captain and his wife is his kinswoman
he has got some body's old two hand sword to mow you off at the knees and that sword hath spawn'd such a dagger
but then he is so hung with pikes halberds petronels calivers and muskets that he looks like a justice of peace's hall a man of two thousand a year is not cess'd at so many weapons as he has on
there was never fencer challenged at so many several foils
you would think he meant to murder all saint pulchre parish
if he could but victual himself for half a year in his breeches he is sufficiently arm'd to over run a country
what means he sir
i pray you master truewit be you a mediator
well i 'll try if he will be appeased with a leg or an arm if not you must die once
i would be loth to lose my right arm for writing madrigals
why if he will be satisfied with a thumb or a little finger all's one to me
you must think i will do my best
what hast thou done
he will let me do nothing he does all afore he offers his left arm
his left wing for a jack daw
take it by all means
maim a man for ever for a jest
what a conscience hast thou
'tis no loss to him he has no employment for his arms but to eat spoon meat
beside as good maim his body as his reputation
he is a scholar and a wit and yet he does not think so
but he loses no reputation with us for we all resolved him an ass before
to your places again
i pray thee let me be in at the other a little
look you'll spoil all these be ever your tricks
no but i could hit of some things that thou wilt miss and thou wilt say are good ones
i pray forbear i will leave it off else
whither were you going
f down into the court to make water
by no means sir you shall rather tempt your breeches
enter here if you love your life
question till you throat be cut do dally till the enraged soul find you
f who is that
daw it is will you in
f ay ay i will in what's the matter
nay if he had been cool enough to tell us that there had been some hope to atone you but he seems so implacably enraged
f 'slight let him rage
but what have you done to him within that should provoke him thus
you have broke some jest upon him afore the ladies
f not i never in my life broke jest upon any man
the bride was praising sir dauphine and he went away in snuff and i followed him unless he took offence at me in his drink erewhile that i would not pledge all the horse full
by my faith and that may be you remember well but he walks the round up and down through every room o' the house with a towel in his hand crying where's la foole
who saw la foole
and when dauphine and i demanded the cause we can force no answer from him but o revenge how sweet art thou
i will strangle him in this towel which leads us to conjecture that the main cause of his fury is for bringing your meat to day with a towel about you to his discredit
why if he be angry for that i'll stay here till his anger be blown over
a good becoming resolution sir if you can put it on o' the sudden
f yes i can put it on or i'll away into the country presently
how will you get out of the house sir
he knows you are in the house and he will watch you this se'ennight but he'll have you
he'll outwait a serjeant for you
f why then i'll stay here
you must think how to victual yourself in time then
f why sweet master truewit will you entreat my cousin otter to send me a cold venison pasty a bottle or two of wine and a chamber pot
a stool were better sir of sir ajax his invention
f ay that will be better indeed and a pallet to lie on
o i would not advise you to sleep by any means
f would you not sir
why then i will not
yet there's another fear f is there
no he cannot break open this door with his foot sure
f i'll set my back against it sir
i have a good back
but then if he should batter
if he dare i'll have an action of battery against him
cast you the worst
he has sent for powder already and what he will do with it no man knows perhaps blow up the corner of the house where he suspects you are
here he comes in quickly
i protest sir john daw he is not this way what will you do
before god you shall hang no petard here
will you not take my word
i never knew one but would be satisfied
sir amorous there's no standing out he has made a petard of an old brass pot to force your door
think upon some satisfaction or terms to offer him
f sir i will give him any satisfaction i dare give any terms
you'll leave it to me then
i'll stand to any conditions
how now what think you sirs
were't not a difficult thing to determine which of these two fear'd most
yes but this fears the bravest the other a whiniling dastard jack daw
but la foole a brave heroic coward
and is afraid in a great look and a stout accent i like him rarely
had it not been pity these two should have been concealed
shall i make a motion
briefly for i must strike while 'tis hot
shall i go fetch the ladies to the catastrophe
ay by my troth
by no mortal means
let them continue in the state of ignorance and err still think them wits and fine fellows as they have done
'twere sin to reform them
well i will have them fetch'd now i think on't for a private purpose of mine do clerimont fetch them and discourse to them all that's past and bring them into the gallery here
this is thy extreme vanity now thou think'st thou wert undone if every jest thou mak'st were not publish'd
thou shalt see how unjust thou art presently
clerimont say it was dauphine's plot
trust me not if the whole drift be not for thy good
there is a carpet in the next room put it on with this scarf over thy face and a cushion on thy head and be ready when i call amorous
what good news sir
faith i have followed and argued with him hard for you
i told him you were a knight and a scholar and that you knew fortitude did consist magis patiendo quam faciendo magis ferendo quam feriendo
it doth so indeed sir
and that you would suffer i told him so at first he demanded by my troth in my conceit too much
what was it sir
your upper lip and six of your fore teeth
nay i told him plainly you could not spare them all
so after long argument pro et con as you know i brought him down to your two butter teeth and them he would have
o did you so
why he shall have them
but he shall not sir by your leave
the conclusion is this sir because you shall be very good friends hereafter and this never to be remembered or upbraided besides that he may not boast he has done any such thing to you in his own person he is to come here in disguise give you five kicks in private sir take your sword from you and lock you up in that study during pleasure which will be but a little while we'll get it released presently
he shall have six sir to be friends
believe me you shall not over shoot yourself to send him that word by me
deliver it sir he shall have it with all my heart to be friends
nay an he should not be so and heartily too upon these terms he shall have me to enemy while i live
come sir bear it bravely
o lord sir 'tis nothing
true what's six kicks to a man that reads seneca
i have had a hundred sir
no speaking one to another or rehearsing old matters
one two three four five
i protest sir amorous you shall have six
nay i told you you should not talk
come give him six an he will needs
now return to your safe custody you shall presently meet afore the ladies and be the dearest friends one to another
give me the scarf now thou shalt beat the other bare faced
stand by sir amorous
i cannot help it without i should take the quarrel upon myself
here he has sent you his sword f i will receive none on't
and he wills you to fasten it against a wall and break your head in some few several places against the hilts
f i will not tell him roundly
i cannot endure to shed my own blood
i'll beat it against a fair flat wall if that will satisfy him if not he shall beat it himself for amorous
why this is strange starting off when a man undertakes for you
i offer'd him another condition will you stand to that
f ay what is't
that you will be beaten in private
f yes i am content at the blunt
then you must submit yourself to be hoodwinked in this scarf and be led to him where he will take your sword from you and make you bear a blow over the mouth gules and tweaks by the nose sans nombre
f i am content
but why must i be blinded
that's for your good sir because if he should grow insolent upon this and publish it hereafter to your disgrace which i hope he will not do you might swear safely and protest he never beat you to your knowledge
f o i conceive
i do not doubt but you will be perfect good friends upon't and not dare to utter an ill thought one of another in future
f not i as god help me of him
nor he of you sir
if he should come sir
all hid sir john
f o sir john sir john
oh o o o o o oh good sir john leave tweaking you'll blow his nose off
'tis sir john's pleasure you should retire into the study
why now you are friends
all bitterness between you i hope is buried you shall come forth by and by damon and pythias upon't and embrace with all the rankness of friendship that can be
i trust we shall have them tamer in their language hereafter
dauphine i worship thee
gods will the ladies have surprised us
centaure how our judgments were imposed on by these adulterate knights
nay madam mavis was more deceived than we 'twas her commendation utter'd them in the college
i commended but their wits madam and their braveries
i never look'd toward their valours
sir dauphine is valiant and a wit too it seems
and a bravery too
was this his project
so master clerimont intimates madam
good morose when you come to the college will you bring him with you
he seems a very perfect gentleman
he is so madam believe it
but when will you come morose
three or four days hence madam when i have got me a coach and horses
no to morrow good morose centaure shall send you her coach
yes faith do and bring sir dauphine with you
she has promised that mavis
he is a very worthy gentleman in his exteriors madam
ay he shews he is judicial in his clothes
and yet not so superlatively neat as some madam that have their faces set in a brake
ay and have every hair in form
that wear purer linen then ourselves and profess more neatness than the french hermaphrodite
ay ladies they what they tell one of us have told a thousand and are the only thieves of our fame that think to take us with that perfume or with that lace and laugh at us unconscionably when they have done
but sir dauphine's carelessness becomes him
i could love a man for such a nose
or such a leg
he has an exceeding good eye madam
and a very good lock
good morose bring him to my chamber first
please your honours to meet at my house madam
see how they eye thee man
they are taken i warrant thee
you have unbraced our brace of knights here master truewit
not i madam it was sir dauphine's ingine who if he have disfurnish'd your ladyship of any guard or service by it is able to make the place good again in himself
there is no suspicion of that sir
god so mavis haughty is kissing
let us go too and take part
but i am glad of the fortune beside the discovery of two such empty caskets to gain the knowledge of so rich a mine of virtue as sir dauphine
we would be all glad to style him of our friendship and see him at the college
he cannot mix with a sweeter society i'll prophesy and i hope he himself will think so
i should be rude to imagine otherwise lady
did not i tell thee dauphine
why all their actions are governed by crude opinion without reason or cause they know not why they do any thing but as they are inform'd believe judge praise condemn love hate and in emulation one of another do all these things alike
only they have a natural inclination sways them generally to the worst when they are left to themselves
but pursue it now thou hast them
shall we go in again morose
we'll entreat sir dauphine's company
stay good madam the interview of the two friends pylades and orestes i'll fetch them out to you straight
will you master truewit
ay but noble ladies do not confess in your countenance or outward bearing to them any discovery of their follies that we may see how they will bear up again with what assurance and erection
we will not sir dauphine
upon our honours sir dauphine
sir amorous sir amorous
the ladies are here
yes but slip out by and by as their backs are turn'd and meet sir john here as by chance when i call you
goes to the other
what say you sir
whip out behind me suddenly and no anger in your looks to your adversary
f noble sir john daw where have you been
to seek you sir amorous
i prevent you sir
they have forgot their rapiers
o they meet in peace man
where's your sword sir john
and yours sir amorous
my boy had it forth to mend the handle e'en now
f and my gold handle was broke too and my boy had it forth
how their excuses meet
what a consent there is in the handles
nay there is so in the points too i warrant you
madam he comes again the madman
what make these naked weapons here gentlemen
here hath like to have been murder since you went a couple of knights fallen out about the bride's favours
we were fain to take away their weapons your house had been begg'd by this time else
for manslaughter sir as being accessary
and for her favours
ay sir heretofore not present clerimont carry them their swords now
they have done all the hurt they will do
have you spoke with the lawyer sir
there is such a noise in the court that they have frighted me home with more violence then i went
such speaking and counter speaking with their several voices of citations appellations allegations certificates attachments intergatories references convictions and afflictions indeed among the doctors and proctors that the noise here is silence to't
a kind of calm midnight
why sir if you would be resolved indeed i can bring you hither a very sufficient lawyer and a learned divine that shall enquire into every least scruple for you
can you master truewit
yes and are very sober grave persons that will dispatch it in a chamber with a whisper or two
good sir shall i hope this benefit from you and trust myself into your hands
your nephew and i have been ashamed and oft times mad since you went to think how you are abused
go in good sir and lock yourself up till we call you we'll tell you more anon sir
do your pleasure with me gentlemen i believe in you and that deserves no delusion
you shall find none sir but heap'd heap'd plenty of vexation
what wilt thou do now wit
recover me hither otter and the barber if you can by any means presently
o i'll make the deepest divine and gravest lawyer out of them two for him thou canst not man these are waking dreams
do not fear me
clap but a civil gown with a welt on the one and a canonical cloak with sleeves on the other and give them a few terms in their mouths if there come not forth as able a doctor and complete a parson for this turn as may be wish'd trust not my election and i hope without wronging the dignity of either profession since they are but persons put on and for mirth's sake to torment him
the barber smatters latin i remember
yes and otter too
well then if i make them not wrangle out this case to his no comfort let me be thought a jack daw or la foole or anything worse
go you to your ladies but first send for them
a f where had you our swords master clerimont
why dauphine took them from the madman
f and he took them from our boys i warrant you
f thank you good master clerimont
sir john daw and i are both beholden to you
would i knew how to make you so gentlemen
sir amorous and i are your servants sir
gentlemen have any of you a pen and ink
i would fain write out a riddle in italian for sir dauphine to translate
not i in troth lady i am no scrivener
i can furnish you i think lady
he has it in the haft of a knife i believe
f no he has his box of instruments
f for the mathematics his square his compasses his brass pens and black lead to draw maps of every place and person where he comes
how maps of persons
f yes sir of nomentack when he was here and of the prince of moldavia and of his mistress mistress epicoene
he hath not found out her latitude i hope
f you are a pleasant gentleman sir
faith now we are in private let's wanton it a little and talk waggishly
sir john i am telling sir amorous here that you two govern the ladies wherever you come you carry the feminine gender afore you
they shall rather carry us afore them if they will sir
nay i believe that they do withal but that you are the prime men in their affections and direct all their actions not i sir amorous is
f i protest sir john is
as i hope to rise in the state sir amorous you have the person
f sir john you have the person and the discourse too
i have no discourse and then you have activity beside
f i protest sir john you come as high from tripoly as i do every whit and lift as many join'd stools and leap over them if you would use it
well agree on't together knights for between you you divide the kingdom or commonwealth of ladies' affections i see it and can perceive a little how they observe you and fear you indeed
you could tell strange stories my masters if you would i know
faith we have seen somewhat sir
f that we have velvet petticoats and wrought smocks or so
ay and nay out with it sir john do not envy your friend the pleasure of hearing when you have had the delight of tasting
why a do you speak sir amorous
f no do you sir john daw
f i'faith you shall
why we have been f in the great bed at ware together in our time
nay do you sir amorous
and these ladies with you knights
f no excuse us sir
we must not wound reputation
f no matter they were these or others
our bath cost us fifteen pound when we came home
do you hear sir john
you shall tell me but one thing truly as you love me
if i can i will sir
you lay in the same house with the bride here
yes and conversed with her hourly sir
and what humour is she of
is she coming and open free
o exceeding open sir
i was her servant and sir amorous was to be
come you have both had favours from her i know and have heard so much
f you shall excuse us sir we must not wound reputation
tut she is married now and you cannot hurt her with any report and therefore speak plainly how many times i'faith
which of you led first
f sir john had her maidenhead indeed
o it pleases him to say so sir but sir amorous knows what is what as well
dost thou i'faith amorous
f in a manner sir
why i commend you lads
little knows don bridegroom of this
nor shall he for me
hang him mad ox
speak softly here comes his nephew with the lady haughty
he'll get the ladies from you sirs if you look not to him in time
f why if he do we'll fetch them home again i warrant you
i assure you sir dauphine it is the price and estimation of your virtue only that hath embark'd me to this adventure and i could not but make out to tell you so nor can i repent me of the act since it is always an argument of some virtue in our selves that we love and affect it so in others
your ladyship sets too high a price on my weakness
sir i can distinguish gems from pebbles are you so skilful in stones
and howsover i may suffer in such a judgment as yours by admitting equality of rank or society with centaure or mavis you do not madam i perceive they are your mere foils
then are you a friend to truth sir it makes me love you the more
it is not the outward but the inward man that i affect
they are not apprehensive of an eminent perfection but love flat and dully
where are you my lady haughty
i come presently centaure
my chamber sir my page shall shew you and trusty my woman shall be ever awake for you you need not fear to communicate any thing with her for she is a fidelia
i pray you wear this jewel for my sake sir dauphine
where is mavis centaure
within madam a writing
i'll follow you presently i'll but speak a word with sir dauphine
good sir dauphine do not trust haughty nor make any credit to her whatever you do besides
sir dauphine i give you this caution she is a perfect courtier and loves nobody but for her uses and for her uses she loves all
besides her physicians give her out to be none o' the clearest whether she pay them or no heaven knows and she's above fifty too and pargets
see her in a forenoon
here comes mavis a worse face then she
you would not like this by candle light
if you'll come to my chamber one o' these mornings early or late in an evening i will tell you more
what have you there
an italian riddle for sir dauphine you shall not see it i'faith centaure
good sir dauphine solve it for me
i'll call for it anon
how dost thou quit thyself of these females
'slight they haunt me like fairies and give me jewels here i cannot be rid of them
o you must not tell though
mass i forgot that i was never so assaulted
one loves for virtue and bribes me with this another loves me with caution and so would possess me a third brings me a riddle here and all are jealous and rail each at other
pray let me see it
sir dauphine i chose this way of intimation for privacy
the ladies here i know have both hope and purpose to make a collegiate and servant of you
if i might be so honoured as to appear at any end of so noble a work i would enter into a fame of taking physic to morrow and continue it four or five days or longer for your visitation
by my faith a subtle one
call you this a riddle
what's their plain dealing trow
we lack truewit to tell us that
we lack him for somewhat else too his knights reformadoes are wound up as high and insolent as ever they were
no drunkards either with wine or vanity ever confess'd such stories of themselves
i would not give a fly's leg in balance against all the womens' reputations here if they could be but thought to speak truth and for the bride they have made their affidavit against her directly what that they have lain with her
yes and tell times and circumstances with the cause why and the place where
i had almost brought them to affirm that they had done it to day
not both of them
yes faith with a sooth or two more i had effected it
they would have set it down under their hands
why they will be our sport i see still whether we will or no
o are you here
come dauphine go call your uncle presently i have fitted my divine and my canonist dyed their beards and all
the knaves do not know themselves they are so exalted and altered
preferment changes any man
thou shalt keep one door and i another and then clerimont in the midst that he may have no means of escape from their cavilling when they grow hot once again
and then the women as i have given the bride her instructions to break in upon him in the l'enuoy
o 'twill be full and twanging
a a come master doctor and master parson look to your parts now and discharge them bravely you are well set forth perform it as well
if you chance to be out do not confess it with standing still or humming or gaping one at another but go on and talk aloud and eagerly use vehement action and only remember your terms and you are safe
let the matter go where it will you have many will do so
but at first be very solemn and grave like your garments though you loose your selves after and skip out like a brace of jugglers on a table
here he comes set your faces and look superciliously while i present you
are these the two learned men
yes sir please you salute them
i had rather do any thing than wear out time so unfruitfully sir
i wonder how these common forms as god save you and you are welcome are come to be a habit in our lives or i am glad to see you
when i cannot see what the profit can be of these words so long as it is no whit better with him whose affairs are sad and grievous that he hears this salutation
'tis true sir we'll go to the matter then
gentlemen master doctor and master parson i have acquainted you sufficiently with the business for which you are come hither and you are not now to inform yourselves in the state of the question i know
this is the gentleman who expects your resolution and therefore when you please begin
please you master doctor
please you good master parson
i would hear the canon law speak first
it must give place to positive divinity sir
nay good gentlemen do not throw me into circumstances
let your comforts arrive quickly at me those that are
be swift in affording me my peace if so i shall hope any
i love not your disputations or your court tumults
and that it be not strange to you i will tell you my father in my education was wont to advise me that i should always collect and contain my mind not suffering it to flow loosely that i should look to what things were necessary to the carriage of my life and what not embracing the one and eschewing the other in short that i should endear myself to rest and avoid turmoil which now is grown to be another nature to me
so that i come not to your public pleadings or your places of noise not that i neglect those things that make for the dignity of the commonwealth but for the mere avoiding of clamours and impertinencies of orators that know not how to be silent
and for the cause of noise am i now a suitor to you
you do not know in what a misery i have been exercised this day what a torrent of evil
my very house turns round with the tumult
i dwell in a windmill the perpetual motion is here and not at eltham
well good master doctor will you break the ice
master parson will wade after
sir though unworthy and the weaker i will presume
'tis no presumption domine doctor
your question is for how many causes a man may have divortium legitimum a lawful divorce
first you must understand the nature of the word divorce a divertendo no excursions upon words good doctor to the question briefly
i answer then the canon law affords divorce but in a few cases and the principal is in the common case the adulterous case but there are duodecim impedimenta twelve impediments as we call them all which do not dirimere contractum but irritum reddere matrimonium as we say in the canon law not take away the bond but cause a nullity therein
i understood you before good sir avoid your impertinency of translation
he cannot open this too much sir by your favour
o you must give the learned men leave sir
to your impediments master doctor
the first is impedimentum erroris
of which there are several species
ay as error personae
if you contract yourself to one person thinking her another
if she be a begger and you thought her rich
if she prove stubborn or head strong that you thought obedient
is that sir a lawful impediment
one at once i pray you gentlemen
ay ante copulam but not post copulam sir
master parson says right
nec post nuptiarum benedictionem
it doth indeed but irrita reddere sponsalia annul the contract after marriage it is of no obstancy
alas sir what a hope are we fallen from by this time
the next is conditio if you thought her free born and she prove a bond woman there is impediment of estate and condition
ay but master doctor those servitudes are sublatae now among us christians
by your favour master parson you shall give me leave master doctor
nay gentlemen quarrel not in that question it concerns not my case pass to the third
well then the third is votum if either party have made a vow of chastity
but that practice as master parson said of the other is taken away among us thanks be to discipline
the fourth is cognatio if the persons be of kin within the degrees
ay do you know what the degrees are sir
no nor i care not sir they offer me no comfort in the question i am sure
but there is a branch of this impediment may which is cognatio spiritualis if you were her godfather sir then the marriage is incestuous
that comment is absurd and superstitious master doctor i cannot endure it
are we not all brothers and sisters and as much akin in that as godfathers and god daughters
to end the controversy i never was a godfather i never was a godfather in my life sir
pass to the next
the fifth is crimen adulterii the known case
the sixth cultus disparitas difference of religion have you ever examined her what religion she is of
no i would rather she were of none than be put to the trouble of it
you may have it done for you sir
by no means good sir on to the rest shall you ever come to an end think you
yes he has done half sir
on to the rest
be patient and expect sir
the seventh is vis if it were upon compulsion or force
o no it was too voluntary mine too voluntary
the eight is ordo if ever she have taken holy orders
no matter master parson would she would go into a nunnery yet
the ninth is ligamen if you were bound sir to any other before
i thrust myself too soon into these fetters
the tenth is publica honestas which is inchoata quaedam affinitas
ay or affinitas orta ex sponsalibus and is but leve impedimentum
i feel no air of comfort blowing to me in all this
the eleventh is affinitas ex fornicatione
which is no less vera affinitas than the other master doctor
true quae oritur ex legitimo matrimonio
you say right venerable doctor and nascitur ex eo quod per conjugium duae personae efficiuntur una caro hey day now they begin
i conceive you master parson ita per fornicationem aeque est verus pater qui sic generat et vere filius qui sic generatur what's all this to me
now it grows warm
the twelfth and last is si forte coire nequibis
ay that is impedimentum gravissimum it doth utterly annul and annihilate that
if you have manifestam frigiditatem you are well sir
why there is comfort come at length sir
confess yourself but a man unable and she will sue to be divorced first
ay or if there be morbus perpetuus et insanabilis as paralysis elephantiasis or so o but frigiditas is the fairer way gentlemen
you say troth sir and as it is in the canon master doctor i conceive you sir
that a boy or child under years is not fit for marriage because he cannot reddere debitum
so your omnipotentes your impotentes you whoreson lobster
your impotentes i should say are minime apti ad contrahenda matrimonium
we shall have most unmatrimonial latin with you matrimonia and be hang'd
you put them out man
but then there will arise a doubt master parson in our case post matrimonium that frigiditate praeditus do you conceive me sir
who cannot uti uxore pro uxore may habere eam pro sorore
absurd absurd absurd and merely apostatical
you shall pardon me master parson i can prove it
you can prove a will master doctor you can prove nothing else
does not the verse of your own canon say haec socianda vetant connubia facta retractant
i grant you but how do they retractare master parson
o this was it i feared
that's false in divinity by your favour
'tis false in humanity to say so
is he not prorsus inutilis ad thorum
can he praestare fidem datam
i would fain know
yes how if he do convalere
he cannot convalere it is impossible
nay good sir attend the learned men they will think you neglect them else
or if he do simulare himself frigidum odio uxoris or so
i say he is adulter manifestus then
they dispute it very learnedly i'faith
and prostitutor uxoris and this is positive
good sir let me escape
you will not do me that wrong sir
and therefore if he be manifeste frigidus sir ay if he be manifeste frigidus i grant you why that was my conclusion
nay hear the conclusion sir
then frigiditatis causa yes causa frigiditatis o mine ears
she may have libellum divortii against you
ay divortii libellum she will sure have
if you confess it
which i would do sir i will do any thing
and clear myself in foro conscientiae because you want indeed yet more
i will not endure it any longer
ladies i beseech you help me
this is such a wrong as never was offered to poor bride before upon her marriage day to have her husband conspire against her and a couple of mercenary companions to be brought in for form's sake to persuade a separation
if you had blood or virtue in you gentlemen you would not suffer such ear wigs about a husband or scorpions to creep between man and wife
o the variety and changes of my torment
let them be cudgell'd out of doors by our grooms
i'll lend you my foot man
we'll have our men blanket them in the hall
as there was one at our house madam for peeping in at the door
stay ladies and gentlemen you'll hear before you proceed
i'd have the bridegroom blanketted too
begin with him first
yes by my troth
ladies for my sake forbear
yes for sir dauphine's sake
he shall command us
f he is as fine a gentleman of his inches madam as any is about the town and wears as good colours when he lists
be brief sir and confess your infirmity she'll be a fire to be quit of you if she but hear that named once you shall not entreat her to stay she'll fly you like one that had the marks upon him
ladies i must crave all your pardons silence ladies
for a wrong i have done to your whole sex in marrying this fair and virtuous gentlewoman hear him good ladies
being guilty of an infirmity which before i conferred with these learned men i thought i might have concealed but now being better informed in his conscience by them he is to declare it and give satisfaction by asking your public forgiveness
i am no man ladies
utterly unabled in nature by reason of frigidity to perform the duties or any the least office of a husband
now out upon him prodigious creature
and would you offer it to a young gentlewoman
a lady of her longings
tut a device a device this it smells rankly ladies
a mere comment of his own
why if you suspect that ladies you may have him search'd as the custom is by a jury of physicians
f yes faith 'twill be brave
o me must i undergo that
no let women search him madam we can do it ourselves
no ladies you shall not need i will take him with all his faults
why then 'tis no divorce doctor if she consent not
no if the man be frigidus it is de parte uxoris that we grant libellum divortii in the law
ay it is the same in theology
worse worse than worst
nay sir be not utterly disheartened we have yet a small relic of hope left as near as our comfort is blown out
clerimont produce your brace of knights
what was that master parson you told me in errore qualitatis e'en now
dauphine whisper the bride that she carry it as if she were guilty and ashamed

if he cannot prove that it is ratum conjugium notwithstanding the premisses
and they do no way impedire
and this is my sentence this i pronounce
i am of master doctor's resolution too sir if you made not that demand ante nuptias

i have been long your poor despised kinsman and many a hard thought has strengthened you against me but now it shall appear if either i love you or your peace and prefer them to all the world beside
i will not be long or grievous to you sir

and clerimont for thy unexpected bringing these two to confession wear my part of it freely
nay sir daw and sir la foole you see the gentlewoman that has done you the favours
we are all thankful to you and so should the woman kind here specially for lying on her though not with her
you meant so i am sure
but that we have stuck it upon you to day in your own imagined persons and so lately this amazon the champion of the sex should beat you now thriftily for the common slanders which ladies receive from such cuckoos as you are
you are they that when no merit or fortune can make you hope to enjoy their bodies will yet lie with their reputations and make their fame suffer
away you common moths of these and all ladies' honours
go travel to make legs and faces and come home with some new matter to be laugh'd at you deserve to live in an air as corrupted as that wherewith you feed rumour
madams you are mute upon this new metamorphosis
but here stands she that has vindicated your fames
take heed of such insectae hereafter
and let it not trouble you that you have discovered any mysteries to this young gentleman he is almost of years and will make a good visitant within this twelvemonth
in the mean time we'll all undertake for his secrecy that can speak so well of his silence
spectators if you like this comedy rise cheerfully and now morose is gone in clap your hands
it may be that noise will cure him at least please him
