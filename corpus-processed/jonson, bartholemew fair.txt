your majesty is welcome to a fair such place such men such language and such ware you must expect with these the zealous noise of your land's faction scandalised at toys as babies hobby horses puppet plays and such like rage whereof the petulant ways yourself have known and have been vext with long
these for your sport without particular wrong or just complaint of any private man who of himself or shall think well or can the maker doth present and hopes to night to give you for a fairing true delight
enter the stage keeper
gentlemen have a little patience they are e'en upon coming instantly
he that should begin the play master littlewit the proctor has a stitch new fallen in his black silk stocking 'twill be drawn up ere you can tell twenty he plays one o' the arches that dwells about the hospital and he has a very pretty part
but for the whole play will you have the truth on't
i am looking lest the poet hear me or his man master brome behind the arras it is like to be a very conceited scurvy one in plain english
when't comes to the fair once you were e'en as good go to virginia for any thing there is of smithfield
he has not hit the humours he does not know them he has not conversed with the bartholomew birds as they say he has ne'er a sword and buckler man in his fair nor a little davy to take toll o' the bawds there as in my time nor a kindheart if any body's teeth should chance to ache in his play nor a juggler with a well educated ape to come over the chain for a king of england and back again for the prince and sit still on his arse for the pope and the king of spain
none of these fine sights
nor has he the canvas cut in the night for a hobby horse man to creep into his she neighbour and take his leap there
no an some writer that i know had had but the penning o' this matter he would have made you such a jig a jog in the booths you should have thought an earthquake had been in the fair
but these master poets they will have their own absurd courses they will be informed of nothing
he has sir reverence kick'd me three or four times about the tiring house i thank him for but offering to put in with my experience
i'll be judged by you gentlemen now but for one conceit of mine would not a fine pomp upon the stage have done well for a property now
and a punk set under upon her head with her stern upward and have been soused by my witty young masters o' the inns of court
what think you of this for a show now
he will not hear o' this
i am an ass
and yet i kept the stage in master tarleton's time i thank my stars
an that man had lived to have played in bartholomew fair you should have seen him have come in and have been cozen'd in the cloth quarter so finely
and adams the rogue have leaped and capered upon him and have dealt his vermin about as though they had cost him nothing
and then a substantial watch to have stolen in upon them and taken them away with mistaking words as the fashion is in the stage practice
enter the bookholder with a scrivener
what rare discourse are you fallen upon ha
have you found any familiars here that you are so free
nothing but the understanding gentlemen o' the ground here ask'd my judgment
sweeping the stage or gathering up the broken apples for the bears within
away rogue it's come to a fine degree in these spectacles when such a youth as you pretend to a judgment
and yet he may in the most of this matter i'faith for the author has writ it just to his meridian and the scale of the grounded judgments here his play fellows in wit
gentlemen comes forward not for want of a prologue but by way of a new one i am sent out to you here with a scrivener and certain articles drawn out in haste between our author and you which if you please to hear and as they appear reasonable to approve of the play will follow presently
read scribe give me the counterpane
articles of agreement indented between the spectators or hearers at the hope on the bankside in the county of surry on the one party and the author of bartholomew fair in the said place and county on the other party the one and thirtieth day of october and in the twelfth year of the reign of our sovereign lord by the grace of god king of england france and ireland defender of the faith and of scotland the seven and fortieth
it is covenanted and agreed by and between the parties aforesaid and the said spectators and hearers as well the curious and envious as the favouring and judicious as also the grounded judgments and understandings do for themselves severally covenant and agree to remain in the places their money or friends have put them in with patience for the space of two hours and an half and somewhat more
in which time the author promiseth to present them by us with a new sufficient play called bartholomew fair merry and as full of noise as sport made to delight all and to offend none provided they have either the wit or the honesty to think well of themselves
it is further agreed that every person here have his or their free will of censure to like or dislike at their own charge the author having now departed with his right it shall be lawful for any man to judge his sixpen'worth his twelvepen'worth so to his eighteen pence two shillings half a crown to the value of his place provided always his place get not above his wit
and if he pay for half a dozen he may censure for all them too so that he will undertake that they shall be silent
he shall put in for censures here as they do for lots at the lottery marry if he drop but six pence at the door and will censure a crown's worth it is thought there is no conscience or justice in that
it is also agreed that every man here exercise his own judgment and not censure by contagion or upon trust from another's voice or face that site by him be he never so first in the commission of wit as also that he be fixed and settled in his censure that what he approves or not approves to day he will do the same to morrow and if to morrow the next day and so the next week if need be and not to be brought about by any that sits on the bench with him though they indite and arraign plays daily
he that will swear jeronimo or andronicus are the best plays yet shall pass unexcepted at here as a man whose judgment shews it is constant and hath stood still these five and twenty or thirty years
though it be an ignorance it is a virtuous and staid ignorance and next to truth a confirmed error does well such a one the author knows where to find him
it is further covenanted concluded and agreed that how great soever the expectation be no person here is to expect more than he knows or better ware than a fair will afford neither to look back to the sword and buckler age of smithfield but content himself with the present
instead of a little davy to take toll o' the bawds the author doth promise a strutting horse courser with a leer drunkard two or three to attend him in as good equipage as you would wish
and then for kindheart the tooth drawer a fine oily pig woman with her tapster to bid you welcome and a consort of roarers for musick
a wise justice of peace meditant instead of a juggler with an ape
a civil cutpurse searchant
a sweet singer of new ballads allurant and as fresh an hypocrite as ever was broached rampant
if there be never a servant monster in the fair who can help it he says nor a nest of antiques
he is loth to make nature afraid in his plays like those that beget tales tempests and such like drolleries to mix his head with other men's heels let the concupiscence of jigs and dances reign as strong as it will amongst you yet if the puppets will please any body they shall be intreated to come in
in consideration of which it is finally agreed by the aforesaid hearers and spectators that they neither in themselves conceal nor suffer by them to be concealed any state decypherer or politic pick lock of the scene so solemnly ridiculous as to search out who was meant by the gingerbread woman who by the hobby horse man who by the costard monger nay who by their wares
or that will pretend to affirm on his own inspired ignorance what mirror of magistrates is meant by the justice what great lady by the pig woman what concealed statesman by the seller of mouse traps and so of the rest
but that such person or persons so found be left discovered to the mercy of the author as a forfeiture to the stage and your laughter aforesaid
as also such as shall so desperately or ambitiously play the fool by his place aforesaid to challenge the author of scurrility because the language somewhere savours of smithfield the booth and the pigbroth or of profaneness because a madman cries god quit you or bless you
in witness whereof as you have preposterously put to your seals already which is your money you will now add the other part of suffrage your hands
the play shall presently begin
and though the fair be not kept in the same region that some here perhaps would have it yet think that therein the author hath observed a special decorum the place being as dirty as smithfield and as stinking every whit
howsoever he prays you to believe his ware is still the same else you will make him justly suspect that he that is so loth to look on a baby or an hobby horse here would be glad to take up a commodity of them at any laughter or loss in another place
i a room in house
enter with a license in his hand
a pretty conceit and worth the finding
i have such luck to spin out these fine things still and like a silk worm out of my self
here's master bartholomew cokes of harrow o' the hill in the county of middlesex esquire takes forth his license to marry mistress grace wellborn of the said place and county and when does he take it forth
the four and twentieth of august
who would have marked such a leap frog chance now
less than ames ace on two dice
well go thy ways john littlewit proctor john littlewit one of the pretty wits of paul's the littlewit of london so thou art called and something beside
when a quirk or a quiblin does 'scape thee and thou dost not watch and apprehend it and bring it afore the constable of conceit there now i speak quib too let them carry thee out o' the archdeacon's court into his kitchen and make a jack of thee instead of a john

come indeed la you are such a fool still

is there the proctor or doctor indeed in the diocese that ever had the fortune to win him such a win
there i am again
i do feel conceits coming upon me more than i am able to turn tongue to
a pox o' these pretenders to wit
your three cranes mitre and mermaid men
not a corn of true salt not a grain of right mustard amongst them all
they may stand for places or so again the next wit fall and pay two pence in a quart more for their canary than other men
but give me the man can start up a justice of wit out of six shillings beer and give the law to all the poets and poet suckers in town because they are the player's gossips
other men have wives as fine as the players and as well drest
enter why how now master littlewit
measuring of lips or moulding of kisses
troth i am a little taken with my win's dressing here does it not fine master winwife
how do you apprehend sir
she would not have worn this habit
i challenge all cheapside to shew such another moorfields pimlico path or the exchange in a summer evening with a lace to boot as this has
dear win let master winwife kiss you
he comes a wooing to our mother win and may be our father perhaps win
there's no harm in him win
none in the earth master littlewit
i envy no man my delicates sir
alas you have the garden where they grow still
a wife here with a strawberry breath cherry lips apricot cheeks and a soft velvet head like a melicotton
now dulness upon me that i had not that before him that i should not light on't as well as he
but my taste master littlewit tends to fruit of a later kind the sober matron your wife's mother
ay we know you are a suitor sir win and i both wish you well by this license here would you had her that your two names were as fast in it as here are a couple
win would fain have a fine young father i' law with a feather that her mother might hood it and chain it with mistress overdo

let me out with it dear win
i'll tell him myself

sir my mother has had her nativity water cast lately by the cunning men in cow lane and they have told her her fortune and do ensure her she shall never have happy hour unless she marry within this sen'night and when it is it must be a madman they say
ay but it must be a gentleman madman
yes so the t'other man of moorfields says
but does she believe them
yes and has been at bedlam twice since every day to inquire if any gentleman be there or to come there mad
why this is a confederacy a mere piece of practice upon her by these impostors
i tell her so or else say i that they mean some young madcap gentleman for the devil can equivocate as well as a shop keeper and therefore would i advise you to be a little madder than master quarlous hereafter
where is she stirring yet
yes and studying an old elder come from banbury a suitor that puts in here at meal tide to praise the painful brethren or pray that the sweet singers may be restored says a grace as long as his breath lasts him
some time the spirit is so strong with him it gets quite out of him and then my mother or win are fain to fetch it again with malmsey or aqua coelestis
yes indeed we have such a tedious life with him for his diet and his clothes too
he breaks his buttons and cracks seams at every saying he sobs out
he cannot abide my vocation he says
no he told my mother a proctor was a claw of the beast and that she had little less than committed abomination in marrying me so as she has done
every line he says that a proctor writes when it comes to be read in the bishop's court is a long black hair kemb'd out of the tail of antichrist
when came this proselyte
some three days since
enter o sir have you ta'en soil here
it's well a man may reach you after three hours' running yet
what an unmerciful companion art thou to quit thy lodging at such ungentlemanly hours
none but a scattered covey of fidlers or one of these rag rakers in dunghills or some marrow bone man at most would have been up when thou wert gone abroad by all description
i pray thee what ailest thou thou canst not sleep
hast thou thorns in thy eye lids or thistles in thy bed
i cannot tell it seems you had neither in your feet that took this pain to find me
no an i had all the lime hounds o' the city should have drawn after you by the scent rather
god save you sir
'twas a hot night with some of us last night john shall we pluck a hair of the same wolf to day proctor john
do you remember master quarlous what we discoursed on last night
not i john nothing that i either discourse or do at those times i forfeit all to forgetfulness
look you there she is and drest as i told you she should be hark you sir whispers him
by this head i'll beware how i keep you company john when i am drunk an you have this dangerous memory that's certain
we were all a little stained last night sprinkled with a cup or two and i agreed with proctor john here to come and do somewhat with win i know not what 'twas to day and he puts me in mind on't now he says he was coming to fetch me
before truth if you have that fearful quality john to remember when you are sober john what you promise drunk john i shall take heed of you john
for this once i am content to wink at you
do you see this john
o win fie what do you mean win
be womanly win make an outcry to your mother win
master quarlous is an honest gentleman and our worshipful good friend win and he is master winwife's friend too and master winwife comes a suitor to your mother win as i told you before win and may perhaps be our father win they'll do you no harm win they are both our worshipful good friends
you must know master quarlous win you must not quarrel with master quarlous win
no we'll kiss again and fall in
yes do good win
in faith you are a fool john
a fool john she calls me do you mark that gentlemen
pretty littlewit of velvet
she may call you an apple john if you use this
pray thee forbear for my respect somewhat
how respective you are become o' the sudden
i fear this family will turn you reformed too pray you come about again
because she is in possibility to be your daughter in law and may ask you blessing hereafter when she courts it to totenham to eat cream
well i will forbear sir but i'faith would thou wouldst leave thy exercise of widow hunting once this drawing after an old reverend smock by the splay foot
there cannot be an ancient tripe or trillibub in the town but thou art straight nosing it and 'tis a fine occupation thou'lt confine thyself to when thou hast got one scrubbing a piece of buff as if thou hadst the perpetuity of pannier ally to stink in or perhaps worse currying a carcass that thou hast bound thyself to alive
i'll be sworn some of them that thou art or hast been suitor to are so old as no chaste or married pleasure can ever become them the honest instrument of procreation has forty years since left to belong to them thou must visit them as thou wouldst do a tomb with a torch or three handfuls of link flaming hot and so thou may'st hap to make them feel thee and after come to inherit according to thy inches
a sweet course for a man to waste the brand of life for to be still raking himself a fortune in an old woman's embers
we shall have thee after thou hast been but a month married to one of them look like the quartan ague and the black jaundice met in a face and walk as if thou hadst borrow'd legs of a spinner and voice of a cricket
i would endure to hear fifteen sermons a week for her and such coarse and loud ones as some of them must be
i would e'en desire of fate i might dwell in a drum and take in my sustenance with an old broken tobacco pipe and a straw
dost thou ever think to bring thine ears or stomach to the patience of a dry grace as long as thy table cloth and droned out by thy son here that might be thy father till all the meat on thy board has forgot it was that day in the kitchen
or to brook the noise made in a question of predestination by the good labourers and painful eaters assembled together put to them by the matron your spouse who moderates with a cup of wine ever and anon and a sentence out of knox between
or the perpetual spitting before and after a sober drawn exhortation of six hours whose better part was the hum ha hum
or to hear prayers groaned out over thy iron chests as if they were charms to break them
and all this for the hope of two apostle spoons to suffer
and a cup to eat a caudle in
for that will be thy legacy
she'll have convey'd her state safe enough from thee an she be a right widow
alas i am quite off that scent now
put off by a brother of banbury one that they say is come here and governs all already
what do you call him
i knew divers of those banburians when i was in oxford
master littlewit can tell us
good win go in and if master bartholomew cokes his man come for the license the little old fellow let him speak with me
what say you gentlemen
what call you the reverend elder you told me of your banbury man
rabbi busy sir he is more than an elder he is a prophet sir
o i know him
a baker is he not
he was a baker sir but he does dream now and see visions he has given over his trade
i remember that too out of a scruple he took that in spiced conscience those cakes he made were served to bridals may poles morrices and such profane feasts and meetings
his christian name is zeal of the land
yes sir zeal of the land busy
what a name's there
o they have all such names sir he was witness for win here they will not be call'd godfathers and named her win the fight you thought her name had been winnifred did you not
he would have thought himself a stark reprobate if it had
ay for there was a blue starch woman of the name at the same time
a notable hypocritical vermin it is i know him
one that stands upon his face more than his faith at all times ever in seditious motion and reproving for vainglory of a most lunatic conscience and spleen and affects the violence of singularity in all he does he has undone a grocer here in newgate market that broke with him trusted him with currants as arrant a zeal as he that's by the way by his profession he will ever be in the state of innocence though and childhood derides all antiquity defies any other learning than inspiration and what discretion soever years should afford him it is all prevented in his original ignorance have not to do with him for he is a fellow of a most arrogant and invincible dulness i assure you
re enter with by your leave gentlemen with all my heart to you and god give you good morrow
master littlewit my business is to you is this license ready
here i have it for you in my hand master humphrey
that's well nay never open or read it to me it's labour in vain you know

now i am in haste sir i do not know and i will not know and i scorn to know and yet now i think on't i will and do know as well as another you must have a mark for your thing here and eight pence for the box i could have saved two pence in that an i had brought it myself but here's fourteen shillings for you
good lord how long your little wife stays
pray god solomon your clerk be not looking in the wrong box master proctor
no i warrant you solomon is wiser than so sir
fie fie fie by your leave master littlewit this is scurvy idle foolish and abominable with all my heart i do not like it
jack littlewit what business does thy pretty head think this fellow may have that he keeps such a coil with
more than buying of gingerbread in the cloister here for that we allow him or a gilt pouch in the fair
master quarlous do not mistake him he is his master's both hands i assure you
to pull on his boots a mornings or his stockings does he
sir if you have a mind to mock him mock him softly and look t'other way for if he apprehend you flout him once he will fly at you presently
a terrible testy old fellow and his name is waspe too

a plague o' this box and the pox too and on him that made it and her that went for't and all that should have sought it sent it or brought it
do you see sir
nay good master waspe

'twill make her spit as fine as she is for all her velvet custard on her head sir
o be civil master numps

let your little wife stale in it an she will
sir i would have you to understand and these gentlemen too if they please with all our hearts sir
that i have a charge gentlemen
they do apprehend sir
pardon me sir neither they nor you can apprehend me yet
you are an ass
i have a young master he is now upon his making and marring the whole care of his well doing is now mine
his foolish schoolmasters have done nothing but run up and down the county with him to beg puddings and cake bread of his tenants and almost spoil'd him he has learn'd nothing but to sing catches and repeat rattle bladder rattle
i dare not let him walk alone for fear of learning of vile tunes which he will sing at supper and in the sermon times
if he meet but a carman in the street and i find him not talk to keep him off on him he will whistle him and all his tunes over at night in his sleep
he has a head full of bees
i am fain now for this little time i am absent to leave him in charge with a gentlewoman 'tis true she is a justice of peace his wife and a gentlewoman of the hood and his natural sister but what may happen under a woman's government there's the doubt
gentlemen you do not know him he is another manner of piece than you think for but nineteen years old and yet he is taller than either of you by the head god bless him
well methinks this is a fine fellow
he has made his master a finer by this description i should think
'faith much about one it is cross and pile whether for a new farthing
i'll tell you gentlemen will't please you drink master waspe
why i have not talk'd so long to be dry sir
you see no dust or cobwebs come out o' my mouth do you
you'd have me gone would you
no but you were in haste e'en now master numps
what an i were
so i am still and yet i will stay too meddle you with your match your win there she has as little wit as her husband it seems i have others to talk to
she's my match indeed and as little wit as i good
we have been but a day and a half in town gentlemen 'tis true and yesterday in the afternoon we walked london to shew the city to the gentlewoman he shall marry mistress grace but afore i will endure such another half day with him i'll be drawn with a good gib cat through the great pond at home as his uncle hodge was
why we could not meet that heathen thing all the day but staid him he would name you all the signs over as he went aloud and where he spied a parrot or a monkey there he was pitched with all the little long coats about him male and female no getting him away
i thought he would have run mad o' the black boy in bucklersbury that takes the scurvy roguy tobacco there
you say true master numps there's such a one indeed
it's no matter whether there be or no what's that to you
he will not allow of john's reading at any hand
enter and o numps
are you here numps
look where i am numps and mistress grace too
nay do not look angerly numps my sister is here and all i do not come without her
what the mischief do you come with her or she with you
we came all to seek you numps
why did you all think i was lost or run away with your fourteen shillings' worth of small ware here
or that i had changed it in the fair for hobby horses
s'precious to seek me
nay good master numps do you shew discretion though he be exorbitant as master overdo says and it be but for conservation of the peace
marry gip goody she justice mistress frenchhood
turd in your teeth and turd in your frenchhood's teeth too to do you service do you see
must you quote your adam to me
you think you are madam regent still mistress overdo when i am in place no such matter
i assure you your reign is out when i am in dame
i am content to be in abeyance sir and be governed by you so should he too if he did well but 'twill be expected you should also govern your passions
will it so forsooth
good lord how sharp you are with being at bedlam yesterday
whetstone has set an edge upon you has he
nay if you know not what belongs to your dignity i do yet to mine
is this the license numps
for love's sake let me see't i never saw a license
did you not so
why you shall not see't then
an you love me good numps
sir i love you and yet i do not love you in these fooleries set your heart at rest there's nothing in it but hard words and what would you see it for
i would see the length and the breadth on't that's all and i will see it now so i will
you shall not see it here
then i'll see it at home and i'll look upon the case here
why do so a man must give way to him a little in trifles gentlemen
these are errors diseases of youth which he will mend when he comes to judgment and knowledge of matters
i pray you conceive so and i thank you and i pray you pardon him and i thank you again
well this dry nurse i say still is a delicate man
and i am for the cosset his charge did you ever see a fellow's face more accuse him for an ass
it confesses him one without accusing
what pity 'tis yonder wench should marry such a cokes
she seems to be discreet and as sober as she is handsome
ay and if you mark her what a restrained scorn she casts upon all his behaviour and speeches
well numps i am now for another piece of business more the fair numps and then bless me
nay never fidge up and down numps and vex itself
i am resolute bartholomew in this i'll make no suit on't to you 'twas all the end of my journey indeed to shew mistress grace my fair

that was mine afore gentlemen this morning
i had that i'faith upon his license believe me there he comes after me
come john this ambitious wit of yours i am afraid will do you no good in the end
you grow so insolent with it and over doing john that if you look not to it and tie it up it will bring you to some obscure place in time and there 'twill leave you
do not trust it too much john be more sparing and use it but now and then a wit is a dangerous thing in this age do not over buy it
think you so gentlemen
i'll take heed on't hereafter
a pretty little soul this same mistress littlewit would i might marry her
so would i or any body else so i might 'scape you
numps i will see it numps 'tis decreed never be melancholy for the matter
why see it sir see it do see it who hinders you
why do you not go see it
the fair numps the fair
would the fair and all the drums and rattles in it were in your belly for me
they are already in your brain
he that had the means to travel your head now should meet finer sights than any are in the fair and make a finer voyage on't to see it all hung with cockle shells pebbles fine wheat straws and here and there a chicken's feather and a cobweb
good faith he looks methinks an you mark him like one that were made to catch flies with his sir cranion legs
and his numps to flap them away
god be wi' you sir there's your bee in a box and much good do't you
gives cokes the box
why your friend and bartholomew an you be so contumacious
what mean you numps

you will not let him go brother and lose him
who can hold that will away
i had rather lose him than the fair i wusse
you do not know the inconvenience gentlemen you persuade to nor what trouble i have with him in these humours
if he go to the fair he will buy of every thing to a baby there and household stuff for that too
if a leg or an arm on him did not grow on he would lose it in the press
pray heaven i bring him off with one stone
and then he is such a ravener after fruit
you will not believe what a coil i had t'other day to compound a business between a cather'nepear woman and him about snatching 'tis intolerable gentlemen
o but you must not leave him now to these hazards numps
nay he knows too well i will not leave him and that makes him presume well sir will you go now
if you have such an itch in your feet to foot it to the fair why do you stop am i o' your tarriers
go will you go sir
why do you not go
o numps have i brought you about
come mistress grace and sister i am resolute bat i'faith still
truly i have no such fancy to the fair nor ambition to see it there's none goes thither of any quality or fashion
you shall pardon me mistress grace we are enow of ourselves to make it a fashion and for qualities let numps alone he'll find qualities
what a rogue in apprehension is this to understand her language no better
ay and offer to marry her
well i will leave the chase of my widow for to day and directly to the fair
these flies cannot this hot season but engender us excellent creeping sport
a man that has but a spoonful of brain would think so
exeunt quarlous and winwife
win you see 'tis in fashion to go to the fair win we must to the fair too you and i win
i have an affair in the fair win a puppet play of mine own making say nothing that i writ for the motion man which you must see win

i'll go in and tell her cut thy lace in the mean time and play the hypocrite sweet win
no i'll not make me unready for it i can be hypocrite enough though i were never so strait laced
you say true you have been bred in the family and brought up to't
our mother is a most elect hypocrite and has maintained us all this seven year with it like gentlefolks
ay let her alone john she is not a wise wilful widow for nothing nor a sanctified sister for a song
and let me alone too i have somewhat of the mother in me you shall see fetch her fetch her exit littlewit
re enter with now the blaze of the beauteous discipline fright away this evil from our house
how now win the fight child
sweet child speak to me
look up sweet win the fight and suffer not the enemy to enter you at this door remember that your education has been with the purest what polluted one was it that named first the unclean beast pig to you child
not i on my sincerity mother
she longed above three hours ere she would let me know it
who was it win
a profane black thing with a beard john
o resist it win the fight it is the tempter the wicked tempter you may know it by the fleshly motion of pig be strong against it and its foul temptations in these assaults whereby it broacheth flesh and blood as it were on the weaker side and pray against its carnal provocations good child sweet child pray
good mother i pray you that she may eat some pig and her belly full too and do not you cast away your own child and perhaps one of mine with your tale of the tempter
how do you do win are you not sick
yes a great deal john uh uh
what shall we do
call our zealous brother busy hither for his faithful fortification in this charge of the adversary
child my dear child you shall eat pig be comforted my sweet child
ay but in the fair mother
i mean in the fair if it can be any way made or found lawful
re enter where is our brother busy
will he not come
presently mother as soon as he has cleansed his beard
i found him fast by the teeth in the cold turkey pie in the cupboard with a great white loaf on his left hand and a glass of malmsey on his right
slander not the brethren wicked one
here he is now purified mother
enter o brother busy
your help here to edify and raise us up in a scruple my daughter win the fight is visited with a natural disease of women called a longing to eat pig
ay sir a bartholomew pig and in the fair
and i would be satisfied from you religiously wise whether a widow of the sanctified assembly or a widow's daughter may commit the act without offence to the weaker sisters
verily for the disease of longing it is a disease a carnal disease or appetite incident to women and as it is carnal and incident it is natural very natural now pig it is a meat and a meat that is nourishing and may be longed for and so consequently eaten it may be eaten very exceeding well eaten but in the fair and as a bartholomew pig it cannot be eaten for the very calling it a bartholomew pig and to eat it so is a spice of idolatry and you make the fair no better than one of the high places
this i take it is the state of the question a high place
ay but in state of necessity place should give place master busy
i have a conceit left yet
good brother zeal of the land think to make it as lawful as you can
yes sir and as soon as you can for it must be sir you see the danger my little wife is in sir
truly i do love my child dearly and i would not have her miscarry or hazard her firstfruits if it might be otherwise
surely it may be otherwise but it is subject to construction subject and hath a face of offence with the weak a great face a foul face but that face may have a veil put over it and be shadowed as it were it may be eaten and in the fair i take it in a booth the tents of the wicked the place is not much not very much we may be religious in the midst of the profane so it be eaten with a reformed mouth with sobriety and humbleness not gorged in with gluttony or greediness there's the fear for should she go there as taking pride in the place or delight in the unclean dressing to feed the vanity of the eye or lust of the palate it were not well it were not fit it were abominable and not good
nay i knew that afore and told her on't but courage win we'll be humble enough we'll seek out the homeliest booth in the fair that's certain rather than fail we'll eat it on the ground
ay and i'll go with you myself win the fight and my brother zeal of the land shall go with us too for our better consolation
ay and solomon too win the more the merrier
win we'll leave rabbi busy in a booth
enter with the cloak
in the way of comfort to the weak i will go and eat
i will eat exceedingly and prophesy there may be a good use made of it too now i think on't by the public eating of swine's flesh to profess our hate and loathing of judaism whereof the brethren stand tax'd
i will therefore eat yea i will eat exceedingly
good i'faith i will eat heartily too because i will be no jew i could never away with that stiff necked generation and truly i hope my little one will be like me that cries for pig so in the mother's belly
very likely exceeding likely very exceeding likely
a number of booths stalls etc
and others sitting by their wares
enter at a distance in disguise
well in justice name and the king's and for the commonwealth
defy all the world adam overdo for a disguise and all story for thou hast fitted thyself i swear
fain would i meet the linceus now that eagle's eye that piercing epidaurian serpent as my quintus horace calls him that could discover a justice of peace and lately of the quorum under this covering
they may have seen many a fool in the habit of a justice but never till now a justice in the habit of a fool
thus must we do though that wake for the public good and thus hath the wise magistrate done in all ages
there is a doing of right out of wrong if the way be found
never shall i enough commend a worthy worshipful man sometime a capital member of this city for his high wisdom in this point who would take you now the habit of a porter now of a carman now of the dog killer in this month of august and in the winter of a seller of tinder boxes
and what would he do in all these shapes
marry go you into every alehouse and down into every cellar measure the length of puddings take the gage of black pots and cans ay and custards with a stick and their circumference with a thread weigh the loaves of bread on his middle finger then would he send for them home give the puddings to the poor the bread to the hungry the custards to his children break the pots and burn the cans himself he would not trust his corrupt officers he would do it himself
would all men in authority would follow this worthy precedent
for alas as we are public persons what do we know
nay what can we know
we hear with other men's ears we see with other men's eyes
a foolish constable or a sleepy watchman is all our information he slanders a gentleman by the virtue of his place as he calls it and we by the vice of ours must believe him
as a while agone they made me yea me to mistake an honest zealous pursuivant for a seminary and a proper young bachelor of musick for a bawd
this we are subject to that live in high place all our intelligence is idle and most of our intelligencers knaves and by your leave ourselves thought little better if not arrant fools for believing them
i adam overdo am resolved therefore to spare spy money hereafter and make mine own discoveries
many are the yearly enormities of this fair in whose courts of pie poudres i have had the honour during the three days sometimes to sit as judge
but this is the special day for detection of those foresaid enormities

give me a drink of ale
this is the very womb and bed of enormity

enter and so walk on in the middle way fore right turn neither to the right hand nor to the left let not your eyes be drawn aside with vanity nor your ear with noises
o i know him by that start
what do you lack what do you buy mistress
a fine hobby horse to make your son a tilter
a drum to make him a soldier
a fiddle to make him a reveller
what is't you lack
little dogs for your daughters
or babies male or female
look not toward them hearken not the place is smithfield or the field of smiths the grove of hobby horses and trinkets the wares are the wares of devils and the whole fair is the shop of satan they are hooks and baits very baits that are hung out on every side to catch you and to hold you as it were by the gills and by the nostrils as the fisher doth therefore you must not look nor turn toward them
the heathen man could stop his ears with wax against the harlot of the sea do you the like with your fingers against the bells of the beast
what flashes come from him
o he has those of his oven a notable hot baker 'twas when he plied the peel he is leading his flock into the fair now
rather driving them to the pens for he will let them look upon nothing
enter and from booth
gentlewomen the weather's hot whither walk you
have a care of your fine velvet caps the fair is dusty
take a sweet delicate booth with boughs here in the way and cool yourselves in the shade you and your friends
the best pig and bottle ale in the fair sir
old ursula is cook there you may read points to the sign a pig's head with a large writing under it
the pig's head speaks it
poor soul she has had a string halt the maryhinchco but she's prettily amended
a delicate show pig little mistress with shweet sauce and crackling like de bay leaf i' de fire la
tou shalt ha' de clean side o' de table clot and di glass vash'd with phatersh of dame annesh cleare
gazing at the inscription
this is fine verily
here be the best pigs and she does roast them as well as ever she did the pig's head says
excellent excellent mistress with fire o' juniper and rosemary branches
the oracle of the pig's head that sir
son were you not warn'd of the vanity of the eye
have you forgot the wholesome admonition so soon
good mother how shall we find a pig if we do not look about for't will it run off o' the spit into our mouths think you as in lubberland and cry wee wee
no but your mother religiously wise conceiveth it may offer itself by other means to the sense as by way of steam which i think it doth here in this place huh huh yes it doth
he scents after it like a hound
and it were a sin of obstinacy great obstinacy high and horrible obstinacy to decline or resist the good titillation of the famelic sense which is the smell
therefore be bold huh huh huh follow the scent enter the tents of the unclean for once and satisfy your wife's frailty
let your frail wife be satisfied your zealous mother and my suffering self will also be satisfied
come win as good winny here as go farther and see nothing
we scape so much of the other vanities by our early entering
it is an edifying consideration
this is scurvy that we must come into the fair and not look on't
win have patience win i'll tell you more anon
exeunt into the booth littlewit mrs
littlewit busy and purecraft
mooncalf entertain within there the best pig in the booth a pork like pig
these are banbury bloods o' the sincere stud come a pig hunting
whit wait whit look to your charge
a pig prepare presently let a pig be prepared to us
enter and 'slight who be these
is this the good service jordan you'd do me
why urse why urse
thou'lt have vapours i' thy leg again presently pray thee go in it may turn to the scratches else
hang your vapours they are stale and stink like you
are these the guests o' the game you promised to fill my pit withal to day
ay what ail they urse
they are all sippers sippers o' the city they look as they would not drink off two pen'orth of bottle ale amongst 'em
a body may read that in their small printed ruffs
away thou art a fool urse and thy mooncalf too in your ignorant vapours now
good guests i say right hypocrites good gluttons
in and set a couple o' pigs on the board and half a dozen of the biggest bottles afore 'em and call whit
i do not love to hear innocents abused fine ambling hypocrites
and a stone puritan with a sorrel head and beard
good mouth'd gluttons two to a pig away
are you sure they are such
the right breed thou shalt try 'em by the teeth urse where's this whit
re enter behold man and see what a worthy man am ee
with the fury of my sword and the shaking of my beard i will make ten thousand men afeard
well said brave whit
in and fear the ale out o' the bottles into the bellies of the brethren and
the sisters drink to the cause and pure vapours
exeunt knockem whit and ursula
my roarer is turn'd tapster methinks
now were a fine time for thee winwife to lay aboard thy widow thou'lt never be master of a better season or place she that will venture herself into the fair and a pig box will admit any assault be assured of that
i love not enterprises of that suddenness though
i'll warrant thee then no wife out of the widow's hundred if i had but as much title to her as to have breathed once on that straight stomacher of hers i would now assure myself to carry her yet ere she went out of smithfield or she should carry me which were the fitter sight i confess
but you are a modest undertaker by circumstances and degrees come 'tis disease in thee not judgment i should offer at all together
enter look here's the poor fool again that was stung by the waspe erewhile
i will make no more orations shall draw on these tragical conclusions
and i begin now to think that by a spice of collateral justice adam overdo deserved this beating for i the said adam was one cause a by cause why the purse was lost and my wife's brother's purse too which they know not of yet
but i shall make very good mirth with it at supper that will be the sport and put my little friend master humphrey waspe's choler quite out of countenance when sitting at the upper end of my table as i use and drinking to my brother cokes and mistress alice overdo as i will my wife for their good affection to old bradley i deliver to them it was i that was cudgeled and shew them the marks
to see what bad events may peep out o' the tail of good purposes
the care i had of that civil young man i took fancy to this morning and have not left it yet drew me to that exhortation which drew the company indeed which drew the cut purse which drew the money which drew my brother cokes his loss which drew on waspe's anger which drew on my beating a pretty gradation
and they shall have it in their dish i'faith at night for fruit i love to be merry at my table
i had thought once at one special blow he gave me to have revealed myself but then i thank thee fortitude i remembered that a wise man and who is ever so great a part of the commonwealth in himself for no particular disaster ought to abandon a public good design
the husbandman ought not for one unthankful year to forsake the plough the shepherd ought not for one scabbed sheep to throw by his tar box the pilot ought not for one leak in the poop to quit the helm nor the alderman ought not for one custard more at a meal to give up his cloke the constable ought not to break his staff and forswear the watch for one roaring night nor the piper of the parish ut parvis componere magna solebam to put up his pipes for one rainy sunday
these are certain knocking conclusions out of which i am resolved come what come can come beating come imprisonment come infamy come banishment nay come the rack come the hurdle welcome all i will not discover who i am till my due time and yet still all shall be as i said ever in justice name and the king's and for the commonwealth
what does he talk to himself and act so seriously poor fool

i am beholden to you sir and to your bartholomew wit
you do not mean this do you
is this your first purchase
yes faith and i do not think numps but thou'lt say it was the wisest act that ever i did in my wardship
i shall say any thing enter and people followed at a distance by i cannot beget a project with all my political brain yet my project is how to fetch off this proper young man from his debauched company
i have followed him all the fair over and still i find him with this songster and i begin shrewdly to suspect their familiarity and the young man of a terrible taint poetry
with which idle disease if he be infected there's no hope of him in a state course
actum est of him for a commonwealth's man if he go to't in rhyme once
yonder he is buying of gingerbread set in quickly before he part with too much of his money
my masters and friends and good people draw near runs to the ballad man
pray thee fellow stay a little good numps look to the goods
what ballads hast thou
let me see let me see myself
he's flown to another lime bush there he will flutter as long more till he have ne'er a feather left
is there a vexation like this gentlemen
will you believe me now hereafter shall i have credit with you
yes faith shalt thou numps and thou art worthy on't for thou sweatest for't
i never saw a young pimp errant and his squire better match'd
faith the sister comes after them well too
nay if you saw the justice her husband my guardian you were fitted for the mess he is such a wise one his way i wonder we see him not here
he is too serious for this place and yet better sport then than the other three i assure you gentlemen wherever he is though it be on the bench
how dost thou call it
a caveat against cut purses
a good jest i'faith i would fain see that demon your cut purse you talk of that delicate handed devil they say he walks hereabout i would see him walk now
look you sister here here he shews his purse boastingly let him come sister and welcome
ballad man does any cut purses haunt hereabout
pray thee raise me one or two begin and shew me one
sir this is a spell against them spick and span new and 'tis made as 'twere in mine own person and i sing it in mine own defence
but 'twill cost a penny alone if you buy it
no matter for the price thou dost not know me i see i am an odd bartholomew
has it a fine picture brother
o sister do you remember the ballads over the nursery chimney at home o' my own pasting up
there be brave pictures other manner of pictures than these friend
yet these will serve to pick the pictures out of your pockets you shall see
so i heard them say
pray thee mind him not fellow he'll have an oar in every thing
it was intended sir as if a purse should chance to be cut in my presence now i may be blameless though as by the sequel will more plainly appear
we shall find that in the matter pray thee begin
to the tune of paggington's pound sir
fa la la la la la la fa la la la
nay i'll put thee in tune and all mine own country dance
it is a gentle admonition you must know sir both to the purse cutter and the purse bearer
not a word more out of the tune an thou lov'st me fa la la la la la la fa la la la
my masters and friends and good people draw near and look to your purses for that i do say ha ha this chimes
good counsel at first dash
and tho' little money in them you do bear it costs more to get than to lose in a day
you oft have been told both the young and the old and bidden beware of the cut purse so bold well said
he were to blame that would not i'faith
then if you take heed not free me from the curse who both give you warning for and the cut purse
youth youth thou had'st better been starved by thy nurse than live to be hanged for cutting a purse
good i'faith how say you numps is there any harm in this
it hath been upbraided to men of my trade that oftentimes we are the cause of this crime the more coxcombs they that did it i wusse
alack and for pity why should it be said
as if they regarded or places or time
examples have been of some that were seen in westminster hall yea the pleaders between then why should the judges be free from this curse more than my poor self for cutting the purse
god a mercy for that
why should they be more free indeed
youth youth thou had'st better been starved by thy nurse than live to be hanged for cutting a purse
that again good ballad man that again
he sings the burden with him
i would fain rub mine elbow now but i dare not pull out my hand
on i pray thee he that made this ballad shall be poet to my masque
at worc'ster 'tis known well and even in the jail a knight of good worship did there shew his face against the foul sinners in zeal for to rail and lost ipso facto his purse in the place
nay once from the seat of judgment so great a judge there did lose a fair pouch of velvéte
o lord for thy mercy how wicked or worse are those that so venture their necks for a purse
youth youth thou had'st better been starv'd by thy nurse than lived to be hanged for cutting a purse
pray thee stay a little friend
yet o' thy conscience numps speak is there any harm in this
to tell you true 'tis too good for you less you had grace to follow it
it doth discover enormity i'll mark it more i have not liked a paltry piece of poetry so well a good while
where's this youth now
a man must call upon him for his own good and yet he will not appear
look here here's for him shews his purse
handy dandy which hand will he have
on i pray thee with the rest i do hear of him but i cannot see him this master youth the cut purse
at plays and at sermons and at the sessions 'tis daily their practice such booty to make
yea under the gallows at executions they stick not the stare abouts' purses to take
nay one without grace at a far better place at court and in christmas before the king's face
that was a fine fellow
i would have him now
alack then for pity must i bear the curse that only belongs to the cunning cut purse
but where's their cunning now when they should use it
they are all chain'd now i warrant you
youth youth thou had'st better the rat catchers' charms are all fools and asses to this a pox on them that they will not come
that a man should have such a desire to a thing and want it
'fore god i'd give half the fair an 'twere mine for a cut purse for him to save his longing
look you sister shews his purse again here here where is't now
which pocket is't in for a wager
i beseech you leave your wagers and let him end his matter an't may be
o are you edified numps
indeed he does interrupt him too much there numps spoke to purpose
sister i am an ass i cannot keep my purse
shews it again and puts it up
on on i pray thee friend
youth youth thou hadst better been starv'd by thy nurse than live to be hanged for cutting a purse
as nightingale sings edgworth gets up to cokes and tickles him in the ear with a straw twice to draw his hand out of his pocket
will you see sport
look there's a fellow gathers up to him mark
o he has lighted on the wrong pocket
'fore god he is a brave fellow pity he should be detected
but o you vile nation of cut purses all relent and repent and amend and be sound and know that you ought not by honest men's fall advance your own fortunes to die above ground and though you go gay in silks as you may it is not the highway to heaven as they say
repent then repent you for better for worse and kiss not the gallows for cutting a purse
youth youth thou had'st better been starv'd by thy nurse than live to be hang'd for cutting a purse
friend let me have the first let me have the first i pray you
as nightingale reaches out the ballad edgworth slips the purse into his hand
pardon me sir first come first serv'd and i'll buy the whole bundle too
that conveyance was better than all did you see't
he has given the purse to the ballad singer
sir i cry you mercy i'll not hinder the poor man's profit pray you mistake me not
sir i take you for an honest gentleman if that be mistaking i met you to day afore ha
my purse is gone my purse my purse my purse
come do not make a stir and cry yourself an ass thorough the fair afore your time
why hast thou it numps
good numps how came you by it i marle
i pray you seek some other gamester to play the fool with you may lose it time enough for all your fair wit
by this good hand glove and all i have lost it already if thou hast it not feel else and mistress grace's handkerchief too out of the t'other pocket
why 'tis well very well exceeding pretty and well
are you sure you have lost it sir
yes as i am an honest man i had it but e'en now at youth youth
i hope you suspect not me sir
that were a jest indeed
dost thou think the gentleman is foolish
where hadst thou hands i pray thee
i shall be beaten again if i be spied
sir i suspect an odd fellow yonder is stealing away
brother it is the preaching fellow you shall suspect him
he was at your t'other purse you know
nay stay sir and view the work you have done an you be beneficed at the gallows and preach there thank your own handy work
sir you shall take no pride in your preferment you shall be silenced quickly
what do you mean sweet buds of gentility
to have my pennyworths out on you bud
no less than two purses a day serve you
i thought you a simple fellow when my man numps beat you in the morning and pitied you
so did i'll be sworn brother but now i see he is a lewd and pernicious enormity as master overdo calls him
mine own words turn'd upon me like swords
cannot a man's purse be at quiet for you in the master's pocket but you must entice it forth and debauch it
overdo is carried off
sir sir keep your debauch and your fine bartholomew terms to yourself and make as much on 'em as you please
but give me this from you in the mean time i beseech you see if i can look to this
because you are an ass sir there's a reason the shortest way an you will needs have it now you have got the trick of losing you'd lose your breech an 'twere loose
i know you sir come deliver takes the box from him you'll go and crack the vermin you breed now will you
'tis very fine will you have the truth on't
they are such retchless flies as you are that blow cut purses abroad in every corner your foolish having of money makes them
an there were no wiser than i sir the trade should lie open for you sir it should i'faith sir
i would teach your wit to come to your head sir as well as your land to come into your hand i assure you sir
nay gentlemen never pity me
i am not worth it lord send me at home once to harrow o' the hill again if i travel any more call me coriat with all my heart
exeunt waspe cokes and mrs
overdo followed by edgworth
stay sir i must have a word with you in private
what's your pleasure good sir
do not deny it you are a cut purse sir this gentleman here and i saw you nor do we mean to detect you though we can sufficiently inform ourselves toward the danger of concealing you but you must do us a piece of service
good gentlemen do not undo me i am a civil young man and but a beginner indeed
sir your beginning shall bring on your ending for us we are no catchpoles nor constables
that you are to undertake is this you saw the old fellow with the black box here
the little old governor sir
that same i see you have flown him to a mark already
i would have you get away that box from him and bring it us
wou'd you have the box and all sir or only that that is in't
i'll get you that and leave him the box to play with still which will be the harder of the two because i would gain your worship's good opinion of me
he says well 'tis the greater mastery and 'twill make the more sport when 'tis mist
ay and 'twill be the longer a missing to draw on the sport
but look you do it now sirrah and keep your word or sir if ever i break my word with a gentleman may i never read word at my need
where shall i find you
somewhere i' the fair hereabouts dispatch it quickly
i would fain see the careful fool deluded
of all beasts i love the serious ass he that takes pains to be one and plays the fool with the greatest diligence that can be
then you would not choose sir but love my guardian justice overdo who is answerable to that description in every hair of him
so i have heard
but how came you mistress wellborn to be his ward or have relation to him at first
faith through a common calamity he bought me sir and now he will marry me to his wife's brother this wise gentleman that you see or else i must pay value o' my land

enter and sir i will take your counsel and cut my hair and leave vapours i see that tobacco and bottle ale and pig and whit and very ursla herself is all vanity
only pig was not comprehended in my admonition the rest were for long hair it is an ensign of pride a banner and the world is full of those banners very full of banners
and bottle ale is a drink of satan's a diet drink of satan's devised to puff us up and make us swell in this latter age of vanity as the smoke of tobacco to keep us in mist and error but the fleshly woman which you call ursla is above all to be avoided having the marks upon her of the three enemies of man the world as being in the fair the devil as being in the fire and the flesh as being herself
enter brother zeal of the land
what shall we do
my daughter win the fight is fallen into her fit of longing again
there is no more is there

a very good vapour

see you not goldylocks the purple strumpet there in her yellow gown and green sleeves
the profane pipes the tinkling timbrels
a shop of relicks

exeunt officers with busy followed by dame purecraft

exeunt littlewit and mrs
let's away i counsell'd you to pack up afore joan
a pox of his bedlam purity
he has spoiled half my ware but the best is we lose nothing if we miss our first merchant
it shall be hard for him to find or know us when we are translated joan
booths stalls a pair of stocks etc
enter and with followed by my masters i do make no doubt but you are officers
and the king's loving and obedient subjects
take heed what you speak i advise you oliver bristle advises you
his loving subjects we grant you but not his obedient at this time by your leave we know ourselves a little better than so we are to command sir and such as you are to be obedient
here's one of his obedient subjects going to the stocks and we'll make you such another if you talk
you are all wise enough in your places i know
if you know it sir why do you bring it in question
i question nothing pardon me
i do only hope you have warrant for what you do and so quit you and so multiply you
bring him up to the stocks there
why bring you him not up
overdo is brought forward
re enter if you have justice overdo's warrant 'tis well you are safe that is the warrant of warrants
i'll not give this button for any man's warrant else
like enough sir but let me tell you an you play away your buttons thus you will want them ere night for any store i see about you you might keep them and save pins i wuss
what should he be that doth so esteem and advance my warrant
he seems a sober and discreet person it is a comfort to a good conscience to be followed with a good fame in his sufferings
the world will have a pretty taste by this how i can bear adversity and it will beget a kind of reverence towards me hereafter even from mine enemies when they shall see i carry my calamity nobly and that it doth neither break me nor bend me
come sir here's a place for you to preach in
will you put in your leg
that i will cheerfully
they put him in the stocks
my conscience a seminary
he kisses the stocks
well my masters i'll leave him with you now i see him bestowed i'll go look for my goods and numps
you may sir i warrant you where's the t'other bawler
fetch him too you shall find them both fast enough
in the midst of this tumult i will yet be the author of mine own rest and not minding their fury sit in the stocks in that calm as shall be able to trouble a triumph
re enter do you assure me upon your words
may i undertake for you if i be asked the question that you have this warrant
what's this fellow for god's sake
do but shew me adam overdo and i am satisfied
he is a fellow that is distracted they say one troubleall he was an officer in the court of pie poudres here last year and put out of his place by justice overdo
upon which he took an idle conceit and is run mad upon't so that ever since he will do nothing but by justice overdo's warrant he will not eat a crust nor drink a little nor make him in his apparel ready
his wife sir reverence cannot get him make his water or shift his shirt without his warrant
if this be true this is my greatest disaster
how am i bound to satisfy this poor man that is of so good a nature to me out of his wits
where there is no room left for dissembling
re enter if you cannot shew me adam overdo i am in doubt of you i am afraid you cannot answer it
before me neighbour bristle and now i think on't better justice overdo is a very parantory person
o are you advised of that
and a severe justicer by your leave
do i hear ill o' that side too
he will sit as upright on the bench an you mark him as a candle in the socket and give light to the whole court in every business
but he will burn blue and swell like a boil god bless us an he be angry
ay and he will be angry too when he lists that's more and when he is angry be it right or wrong he has the law on's side ever i mark that too
i will be more tender hereafter
i see compassion may become a justice though it be a weakness i confess and nearer a vice than a virtue
well take him out o' the stocks again we'll go a sure way to work we'll have the ace of hearts of our side if we can
they take overdo out
enter and officers with followed by come bring him away to his fellow there
master busy we shall rule your legs i hope though we cannot rule your tongue
no minister of darkness no thou canst not rule my tongue my tongue it is mine own and with it i will both knock and mock down your bartholomew abominations till you be made a hissing to the neighbouring parishes round about
let him alone we have devised better upon't
and shall he not into the stocks then
no mistress we'll have them both to justice overdo and let him do over 'em as is fitting then i and my gossip haggise and my beadle pocher are discharged
o i thank you blessed honest men
nay never thank us but thank this madman that comes here
he put it in our heads
re enter is he mad
now heaven increase his madness and bless it and thank it
sir your poor handmaid thanks you
have you a warrant

yes i have a warrant out of the word to give thanks for removing any scorn intended to the brethren
exeunt all but troubleall
it is justice overdo's warrant that i look for if you have not that keep your word i'll keep mine
quit ye and multiply ye
enter and come away nightingale i pray thee
for what you go about you know how fit it is an you have no warrant bless you i'll pray for you that's all i can do
a madman that haunts the fair do you not know him
it's marvel he has not more followers after his ragged heels
beshrew him he startled me i thought he had known of our plot
guilt's a terrible thing
have you prepared the costard monger
yes and agreed for his basket of pears he is at the corner here ready
and your prize he comes down sailing that way all alone without his protector he is rid of him it seems
ay i know i should have followed his protectorship for a feat i am to do upon him but this offered itself so in the way i could not let scape here he comes whistle be this sport call'd dorring the dotterel
re enter wh wh wh wh etc
by this light i cannot find my gingerbread wife nor my hobby horse man in all the fair now to have my money again and i do not know the way out on't to go home for more
do you hear friend you that whistle
what tune is that you whistle
a new tune i am practising sir
dost thou know where i dwell i pray thee
nay on with thy tune i have no such haste for an answer i'll practise with thee
enter with a basket of pears

nightingale sets his foot afore him and he falls with his basket

a delicate great boy
methinks he out scrambles them all
i cannot persuade myself but he goes to grammar school yet and plays the truant to day
would he had another purse to cut zekiel
a man might cut out his kidneys i think and he never feel 'em he is so earnest at the sport
his soul is half way out on's body at the game
away nightingale that way
nightingale runs off with his sword cloke and hat
i think i am furnish'd for cather'ne pears for one under meal give me my cloke
good gentleman give me my ware

my cloke and my hat ha
ods 'lid is he gone
help me to cry gentlemen
away costard monger come to us to ursula's
talk of him to have a soul
'heart if he have any more than a thing given him instead of salt only to keep him from stinking i'll be hang'd afore my time presently where should it be trow
he has not so much toward it in his whole body as will maintain a good flea
and if he take this course he will not have so much land left as to rear a calf within this twelvemonth
was there ever green plover so pull'd
that his little overseer had been here now and been but tall enough to see him steal pears in exchange for his beaver hat and his cloke thus
i must go find him out next for his black box and his patent it seems he has of his place which i think the gentleman would have a reversion of that spoke to me for it so earnestly
re enter would i might lose my doublet and hose too as i am an honest man and never stir if i think there be any thing but thieving and cozening in this whole fair
bartholomew fair quoth he
an ever any bartholomew had that luck in't that i have had i'll be martyr'd for him and in smithfield too
i have paid for my pears a rot on 'em
i'll keep them no longer throws away his pears
you were choke pears to me i had been better have gone to mum chance for you i wuss
methinks the fair should not have used me thus an 'twere but for my name's sake i would not have used a dog o' the name so
o numps will triumph now
enter friend do you know who i am or where i lie
i do not myself i'll be sworn
do but carry me home and i'll please thee i have money enough there
i have lost myself and my cloke and my hat and my fine sword and my sister and numps and mistress grace a gentlewoman that i should have married and a cut work handkerchief she gave me and two purses to day and my bargain of hobby horses and gingerbread which grieves me worst of all
by whose warrant sir have you done all this
thou art a wise fellow indeed as if a man need a warrant to lose any thing with
yes justice overdo's warrant a man may get and lose with i'll stand to't
dost thou know him
i lie there he is my brother in law he married my sister pray thee shew me the way dost thou know the house
sir shew me your warrant i know nothing without a warrant pardon me
why i warrant thee come along thou shalt see i have wrought pillows there and cambric sheets and sweet bags too
pray thee guide me to the house
sir i'll tell you go you thither yourself first alone tell your worshipful brother your mind and but bring me three lines of his hand or his clerk's with adam overdo underneath here i'll stay you i'll obey you and i'll guide you presently
'slid this is an ass i have found him pox upon me what do i talking to such a dull fool
you are a very coxcomb do you hear
i think i am if justice overdo sign to it i am and so we are all he'll quit us all multiply us all
another part of the fair
enter and with their swords drawn
gentlemen this is no way that you take you do but breed one another trouble and offence and give me no contentment at all
i am not she that affects to be quarrell'd for or have my name or fortune made the question of men's swords
'sblood we love you
if you both love me as you pretend your own reason will tell you but one can enjoy me and to that point there leads a directer line than by my infamy which must follow if you fight
'tis true i have profest it to you ingenuously that rather than to be yoked with this bridegroom is appointed me i would take up any husband almost upon any trust though subtlety would say to me i know he is a fool and has an estate and i might govern him and enjoy a friend beside but these are not my aims i must have a husband i must love or i cannot live with him
i shall ill make one of these politic wives
why if you can like either of us lady say which is he and the other shall swear instantly to desist
content i accord to that willingly
sure you think me a woman of an extreme levity gentlemen or a strange fancy that meeting you by chance in such a place as this both at one instant and not yet of two hours' acquaintance neither of you deserving afore the other of me i should so forsake my modesty though i might affect one more particularly as to say this is he and name him
why wherefore should you not
what should hinder you
if you would not give it to my modesty allow it yet to my wit give me so much of woman and cunning as not to betray myself impertinently
how can i judge of you so far as to a choice without knowing you more
you are both equal and alike to me yet and so indifferently affected by me as each of you might be the man if the other were away for you are reasonable creatures you have understanding and discourse and if fate send me an understanding husband i have no fear at all but mine own manners shall make him a good one
would i were put forth to making for you then
it may be you are you know not what is toward you will you consent to a motion of mine gentlemen
whatever it be we'll presume reasonableness coming from you
i saw one of you buy a pair of tables e'en now
yes here they be and maiden ones too unwritten in
the fitter for what they may be employed in
you shall write either of you here a word or a name what you like best but of two or three syllables at most and the next person that comes this way because destiny has a high hand in business of this nature i'll demand which of the two words he or she doth approve and according to that sentence fix my resolution and affection without change
agreed my word is conceived already
and mine shall not be long creating after
but you shall promise gentlemen not to be curious to know which of you it is taken but give me leave to conceal that till you have brought me either home or where i may safely tender myself
why that's but equal
because i will bind both your endeavours to work together friendly and jointly each to the other's fortune and have myself fitted with some means to make him that is forsaken a part of amends
these conditions are very courteous
well my word is out of the arcadia then argalus
and mine out of the play palemon
enter have you any warrant for this gentlemen
there must be a warrant had believe it
for whatsoever it is any thing indeed no matter what
'slight here's a fine ragged prophet dropt down i' the nick
heaven quit you gentlemen
nay stay a little good lady put him to the question
you are content then
sir here are two names written is justice overdo one
i pray you read them to yourself it is for a wager between these gentlemen and with a stroke or any difference mark which you approve best
they may be both worshipful names for aught i know mistress but adam overdo had been worth three of them i assure you in this place that's in plain english
this man amazes me i pray you like one of them sir
i do like him there that has the best warrant mistress to save your longing and multiply him it may be this
but i am still for justice overdo that's my conscience and quit you

he'll go near to form to her what a debauched rascal i am and fright her out of all good conceit of me i should do so by him i am sure if i had the opportunity
but my hope is in her temper yet and it must needs be next to despair that is grounded on any part of a woman's discretion
i would give by my troth now all i could spare to my clothes and my sword to meet my tatter'd soothsayer again who was my judge in the question to know certainly whose word he has damn'd or saved for till then i live but under a reprieve

how now all 'scaped
her velvet hat is a witch o' my conscience or my key
the madman was a devil and i am an ass so bless me my place and mine office
v the fair as before
dressed as a puppet show man and with a flag
well luck and saint bartholomew
out with the sign of our invention in the name of wit and do you beat the drum the while all the foul i' the fair i mean all the dirt in smithfield that's one of master littlewit's carwhitchets now will be thrown at our banner to day if the matter does not please the people
o the motions that i lanthorn leatherhead have given light to in my time since my master pod died
jerusalem was a stately thing and so was nineveh and the city of norwich and sodom and gomorrah with the rising of the prentices and pulling down the bawdy houses there upon shrove tuesday but the gun powder plot there was a get penny
i have presented that to an eighteen or twenty pence audience nine times in an afternoon
your home born projects prove ever the best they are so easy and familiar they put too much learning in their things now o' days and that i fear will be the spoil of this
if not too mickle
look to your gathering there goodman filcher
i warrant you sir
an there come any gentlefolks take two pence apiece sharkwell
i warrant you sir three pence an we can
another part of the fair
enter disguised like a porter
this latter disguise i have borrow'd of a porter shall carry me out to all my great and good ends which however interrupted were never destroyed in me neither is the hour of my severity yet come to reveal myself wherein cloud like i will break out in rain and hail lightning and thunder upon the head of enormity
two main works i have to prosecute first one is to invent some satisfaction for the poor kind wretch who is out of his wits for my sake and yonder i see him coming i will walk aside and project for it
enter and i wonder where tom quarlous is that he returns not it may be he is struck in here to seek us
see here's our madman again
enter in clothes followed by i have made myself as like him as his gown and cap will give me leave
sir i love you and would be glad to be mad with you in truth
my widow in love with a madman
verily i can be as mad in spirit as you
gentlewoman have i found you
save ye quit ye and multiply ye
'twas a sufficient name i mark'd let me see't be not afraid to shew't me
what would you with it sir
mark it again and again at your service
here it is sir this was it you mark'd
fare you well fare you well
yes faith he has discovered it to you now and therefore 'twere vain to disguise it longer i am yours sir by the benefit of your fortune
and you have him mistress believe it that shall never give you cause to repent her benefit but make you rather to think that in this choice she had both her eyes
i desire to put it to no danger of protestation
exeunt grace and winwife
palemon the word and winwife the man
good sir vouchsafe a yoke fellow in your madness shun not one of the sanctified sisters that would draw with you in truth
away you are a herd of hypocritical proud ignorants rather wild than mad fitter for woods and the society of beasts than houses and the congregation of men
you are the second part of the society of canters outlaws to order and discipline and the only privileged church robbers of christendom
let me alone palemon the word and winwife the man
i must uncover myself unto him or i shall never enjoy him for all the cunning men's promises
good sir hear me i am worth six thousand pound my love to you is become my rack i'll tell you all and the truth since you hate the hypocrisy of the party coloured brotherhood
these seven years i have been a wilful holy widow only to draw feasts and gifts from my entangled suitors i am also by office an assisting sister of the deacons and a devourer instead of a distributor of the alms
i am a special maker of marriages for our decayed brethren with our rich widows for a third part of their wealth when they are married for the relief of the poor elect as also our poor handsome young virgins with our wealthy bachelors or widowers to make them steal from their husbands when i have confirmed them in the faith and got all put into their custodies
and if i have not my bargain they may sooner turn a scolding drab into a silent minister than make me leave pronouncing reprobation and damnation unto them
our elder zeal of the land would have had me but i know him to be the capital knave of the land making himself rich by being made a feoffee in trust to deceased brethren and cozening their heirs by swearing the absolute gift of their inheritance
and thus having eased my conscience and utter'd my heart with the tongue of my love enjoy all my deceits together i beseech you
i should not have revealed this to you but that in time i think you are mad and i hope you'll think me so too sir
stand aside i'll answer you presently
why should i not marry this six thousand pound now i think on't and a good trade too that she has beside ha
the t'other wench winwife is sure of there's no expectation for me there
here i may make myself some saver yet if she continue mad there's the question
it is money that i want why should not i marry the money when 'tis offer'd me
i have a license and all it is but razing out one name and putting in another
there's no playing with a man's fortune
i am resolved i were truly mad an i would not
well come your ways follow me an you will be mad i'll shew you a warrant
takes her along with him
most zealously it is that i zealously desire
sir let me speak with you
the warrant that you tender and respect so justice overdo's
i am the man friend troubleall though thus disguised as the careful magistrate ought for the good of the republic in the fair and the weeding out of enormity
do you want a house or meat or drink or clothes
speak whatsoever it is it shall be supplied you what want you
nothing but your warrant
to be gone sir
nay i pray thee stay i am serious and have not many words nor much time to exchange with thee
think what may do thee good
your hand and seal will do me a great deal of good nothing else in the whole fair that i know
if it were to any end thou shouldst have it willingly
why it will satisfy me that's end enough to look on an you will not give it me let me go
thou shalt have it presently i'll but step into the scrivener's here by and bring it
do not go away
why this madman's shape will prove a very fortunate one i think
can a ragged robe produce these effects
if this be the wise justice and he bring me his hand i shall go near to make some use on't
re enter he is come already
here is my hand and seal adam overdo if there be any thing to be written above in that paper that thou want'st now or at any time hereafter think on't it is my deed
i deliver it so can your friend write
her hand for a witness and all is well
with all my heart
he urges her to sign it
why should not i have the conscience to make this a bond of a thousand pound now or what i would else
look you there it is and i deliver it as my deed again
let us now proceed in madness
exeunt quarlous and dame purecraft
well my conscience is much eased i have done my part though it doth him no good yet adam hath offered satisfaction
the sting is removed from hence
poor man he is much altered with his affliction it has brought him low
now for my other work reducing the young man i have followed so long in love from the brink of his bane to the centre of safety
here or in some such like vain place i shall be sure to find him
i will wait the good time

these be players minors indeed

they are actors sir and as good as any none dispraised for dumb shows indeed i am the mouth of them all

and this is lovely hero this with the beard damon and this pretty pythias this is the ghost of king dionysius in the habit of a scrivener as you shall see anon at large
well they are a civil company i like 'em for that they offer not to fleer nor jeer nor break jests as the great players do and then there goes not so much charge to the feasting of them or making them drunk as to the other by reason of their littleness
do they use to play perfect
are they never fluster'd
no sir i thank my industry and policy for it they are as well govern'd a company though i say it and here is young leander is as proper an actor of his inches and shakes his head like an hostler
but do you play it according to the printed book
i have read that

a better way sir that is too learned and poetical for our audience what do they know what hellespont is guilty of true love's blood
or what abydos is
or the other sestos hight
thou art in the right i do not know myself
no i have entreated master littlewit to take a little pains to reduce it to a more familiar strain for our people
how i pray thee good master littlewit
it pleases him to make a matter of it sir but there is no such matter i assure you i have only made it a little easy and modern for the times sir that's all

you whore master knave
thou art a whore master
see cupid with a word has tane up the brawl
these be fine vapours
by this good day they fight bravely do they not numps
yes they lack'd but you to be their second all this while
this tragical encounter falling out thus to busy us it raises up the ghost of their friend dionysius not like a monarch but the master of a school in a scrivener's furr'd gown which shews he is no fool for therein he hath wit enough to keep himself warm
o damon he cries and pythias what harm hath poor dionysius done you in his grave that after his death you should fall out thus and rave and call amorous leander whore master knave
i cannot i will not i promise you endure it
'tis i i will no longer endure your profanations
what mean you sir
i will remove dagon there i say that idol that heathenish idol that remains as i may say a beam a very beam not a beam of the sun nor a beam of the moon nor a beam of a balance neither a house beam nor a weaver's beam but a beam in the eye in the eye of the brethren a very great beam an exceeding great beam such as are your stage players rimers and morrice dancers who have walked hand in hand in contempt of the brethren and the cause and been born out by instruments of no mean countenance
sir i present nothing but what is licensed by authority
thou art all license even licentiousness itself shimei
i have the master of the revels' hand for't sir
the master of the rebels' hand thou hast
hold thy peace thy scurrility shut up thy mouth thy profession is damnable and in pleading for it thou dost plead for baal
i have long opened my mouth wide and gaped i have gaped as the oyster for the tide after thy destruction but cannot compass it by suit or dispute so that i look for a bickering ere long and then a battle
friend you'd have an ill match on't if you bicker with him here though he be no man of the fist he has friends that will to cuffs for him
numps will not you take our side
sir it shall not need in my mind he offers him a fairer course to end it by disputation hast thou nothing to say for thyself in defence of thy quality
faith sir i am not well studied in these controversies between the hypocrites and us
but here's one of my motion puppet dionysius shall undertake him and i'll venture the cause on't
who my hobby horse
will he dispute with him
yes sir and make a hobby ass of him i hope
indeed he looks like the best scholar of them all
come sir you must be as good as your word now
i will not fear to make my spirit and gifts known assist me zeal fill me fill me that is make me full
what a desperate profane wretch is this
is there any ignorance or impudence like his to call his zeal to fill him against a puppet
i know no fitter match than a puppet to commit with an hypocrite
first i say unto thee idol thou hast no calling
you lie i am call'd dionysius
the motion says you lie he is call'd dionysius in the matter and to that calling he answers
i mean no vocation idol no present lawful calling
is yours a lawful calling
the motion asketh if yours be a lawful calling
yes mine is of the spirit
then idol is a lawful calling
he says then idol is a lawful calling for you call'd him idol and your calling is of the spirit
well disputed hobby horse
take not part with the wicked young gallant he neigheth and hinnieth all is but hinnying sophistry
i call him idol again yet i say his calling his profession is profane it is profane idol
it is not profane
it is not profane he says
it is not profane
it is not profane
well said confute him with not still
you cannot bear him down with your base noise sir
nor he me with his treble creeking though he creek like the chariot wheels of satan i am zealous for the cause as a dog for a bone
and i say it is profane as being the page of pride and the waiting woman of vanity
what say you to your tire women then
or feather makers in the friers that are of your faction of faith
are not they with their perukes and their puffs their fans and their huffs as much pages of pride and waiters upon vanity
what say you what say you what say you
i will not answer for them
because you cannot because you cannot
is a bugle maker a lawful calling
or the confect makers
such you have there or your french fashioner
you would have all the sin within yourselves would you not would you not
is a puppet worse than these
yes and my main argument against you is that you are an abomination for the male among you putteth on the apparel of the female and the female of the male
you lie you lie you lie abominably
good by my troth he has given him the lie thrice
it is your old stale argument against the players but it will not hold against the puppets for we have neither male nor female amongst us
and that thou may'st see if thou wilt like a malicious purblind zeal as thou art
takes up his garment
by my faith there he has answer'd you friend a plain demonstration
nay i'll prove against e'er a rabbin of them all that my standing is as lawful as his that i speak by inspiration as well as he that i have as little to do with learning as he and do scorn her helps as much as he
i am confuted the cause hath failed me
then be converted be converted
be converted i pray you and let the play go on
let it go on for i am changed and will become a beholder with you
