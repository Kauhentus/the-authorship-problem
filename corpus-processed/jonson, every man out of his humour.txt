the author's friend a man inly acquainted with the scope and drift of his plot of a discreet and understanding judgment and has the place of a moderator
is a person of no action and therefore we afford him no character
after the second sounding
nay my dear asper
who is so patient of this impious world that he can check his spirit or rein his tongue
or who hath such a dead unfeeling sense that heaven's horrid thunders cannot wake
to see the earth crack'd with the weight of sin hell gaping under us and o'er our heads black ravenous ruin with her sail stretch'd wings ready to sink us down and cover us
who can behold such prodigies as these and have his lips seal'd up
not i my soul was never ground into such oily colours to flatter vice and daub iniquity but with an armed and resolved hand i'll strip the ragged follies of the time naked as at their birth be not too bold
you trouble me and with a whip of steel print wounding lashes in their iron ribs
i fear no mood stamp'd in a private brow when i am pleased t'unmask a public vice
i fear no strumpet's drugs nor ruffian's stab should i detect their hateful luxuries no broker's usurer's or lawyer's gripe were i disposed to say they are all corrupt
i fear no courtier's frown should i applaud the easy flexure of his supple hams
tut these are so innate and popular that drunken custom would not shame to laugh in scorn at him that should but dare to tax 'em and yet not one of these but knows his works knows what damnation is the devil and hell yet hourly they persist grow rank in sin puffing their souls away in perjurous air to cherish their extortion pride or lusts
forbear good asper be not like your name
o but to such whose faces are all zeal and with the words of hercules invade such crimes as these
that will not smell of sin but seem as they were made of sanctity
religion in their garments and their hair cut shorter than their eye brows
when the conscience is vaster than the ocean and devours more wretches than the counters
gentle asper contain our spirits in more stricter bounds and be not thus transported with the violence of your strong thoughts
unless your breath had power to melt the world and mould it new again it is in vain to spend it in these moods
i not observed this thronged round till now
gracious and kind spectators you are welcome apollo and muses feast your eyes with graceful objects and may our minerva answer your hopes unto their largest strain
yet here mistake me not judicious friends i do not this to beg your patience or servilely to fawn on your applause like some dry brain despairing in his merit
let me be censured by the austerest brow where i want art or judgment tax me freely
let envious censors with their broadest eyes look through and through me i pursue no favour only vouchsafe me your attentions and i will give you music worth your ears
o how i hate the monstrousness of time where every servile imitating spirit plagued with an itching leprosy of wit in a mere halting fury strives to fling his ulcerous body in the thespian spring and straight leaps forth a poet
but as lame as vulcan or the founder of cripplegate
in faith this humour will come ill to some you will be thought to be too peremptory
and why this humour mitis
nay do not turn but answer
i will not stir your patience pardon me i urged it for some reasons and the rather to give these ignorant well spoken days some taste of their abuse of this word humour
o do not let your purpose fall good asper it cannot but arrive most acceptable chiefly to such as have the happiness daily to see how the poor innocent word is rack'd and tortured
ay i pray you proceed
for the abuse of humour
o i crave pardon i had lost my thoughts
why humour as 'tis 'ens' we thus define it to be a quality of air or water and in itself holds these two properties moisture and fluxure as for demonstration pour water on this floor 'twill wet and run likewise the air forced through a horn or trumpet flows instantly away and leaves behind a kind of dew and hence we do conclude that whatsoe'er hath fluxure and humidity as wanting power to contain itself is humour
so in every human body the choler melancholy phlegm and blood by reason that they flow continually in some one part and are not continent receive the name of humours
now thus far it may by metaphor apply itself unto the general disposition as when some one peculiar quality doth so possess a man that it doth draw all his affects his spirits and his powers in their confluctions all to run one way this may be truly said to be a humour but that a rook by wearing a pyed feather the cable hat band or the three piled ruff a yard of shoe tye or the switzer's knot on his french garters should affect a humour
o it is more than most ridiculous
he speaks pure truth now if an idiot have but an apish or fantastic strain it is his humour
well i will scourge those apes and to these courteous eyes oppose a mirror as large as is the stage whereon we act where they shall see the time's deformity anatomised in every nerve and sinew with constant courage and contempt of fear
asper i urge it as your friend take heed the days are dangerous full of exception and men are grown impatient of reproof
you might as well have told me yond' is heaven this earth these men and all had moved alike
do not i know the time's condition
yes mitis and their souls and who they be that either will or can except against me
none but a sort of fools so sick in taste that they contemn all physic of the mind and like gall'd camels kick at every touch
good men and virtuous spirits that loath their vices will cherish my free labours love my lines and with the fervour of their shining grace make my brain fruitful to bring forth more objects worthy their serious and intentive eyes
but why enforce i this
if any here chance to behold himself let him not dare to challenge me of wrong for if he shame to have his follies known first he should shame to act 'em my strict hand was made to seize on vice and with a gripe squeeze out the humour of such spongy souls as lick up every idle vanity
why this is right furor poeticus
kind gentlemen we hope your patience will yet conceive the best or entertain this supposition that a madman speaks
what are you ready there
mitis sit down and my cordatus
i leave you two as censors to sit here observe what i present and liberally speak your opinions upon every scene as it shall pass the view of these spectators
nay now y'are tedious sirs for shame begin
and mitis note me if in all this front you can espy a gallant of this mark who to be thought one of the judicious sits with his arms thus wreath'd his hat pull'd here cries mew and nods then shakes his empty head will shew more several motions in his face than the new london rome or niniveh and now and then breaks a dry biscuit jest which that it may more easily be chew'd he steeps in his own laughter
why will that make it be sooner swallowed
or if it did not yet as horace sings mean cates are welcome still to hungry guests
'tis true but why should we observe them asper
o i would know 'em for in such assemblies they are more infectious than the pestilence and therefore i would give them pills to purge and make them fit for fair societies
how monstrous and detested is't to see a fellow that has neither art nor brain sit like an aristarchus or start ass taking men's lines with a tobacco face in snuff still spitting using his wry'd looks in nature of a vice to wrest and turn the good aspect of those that shall sit near him from what they do behold
o 'tis most vile
peace mitis i do know your thought you'll say your guests here will except at this pish
you are too timorous and full of doubt
then he a patient shall reject all physic 'cause the physician tells him you are sick or if i say that he is vicious you will not hear of virtue
come you are fond
shall i be so extravagant to think that happy judgments and composed spirits will challenge me for taxing such as these
nay but good pardon us we must not bear this peremptory sail but use our best endeavours how to please
why therein i commend your careful thoughts and i will mix with you in industry to please but whom
attentive auditors such as will join their profit with their pleasure and come to feed their understanding parts for these i'll prodigally spread myself and speak away my spirit into air for these i'll melt my brain into invention coin new conceits and hang my richest words as polish'd jewels in their bounteous ears
but stay i lose myself and wrong their patience if i dwell here they'll not begin i see
friends sit you still and entertain this troop with some familiar and by conference i'll hast them sound
now gentlemen i go to turn an actor and a humorist where ere i do resume my present person we hope to make the circles of your eyes flow with distilled laughter if we fail we must impute it to this only chance art hath an enemy call'd ignorance
how do you like his spirit mitis
i should like it much better if he were less confident
why do you suspect his merit
no but i fear this will procure him much envy
o that sets the stronger seal on his desert if he had no enemies i should esteem his fortunes most wretched at this instant
you have seen his play cordatus pray you how is it
faith sir i must refrain to judge only this i can say of it 'tis strange and of a particular kind by itself somewhat like 'vetus comoedia' a work that hath bounteously pleased me how it will answer the general expectation i know not
does he observe all the laws of comedy in it
what laws mean you
why the equal division of it into acts and scenes according to the terentian manner his true number of actors the furnishing of the scene with grex or chorus and that the whole argument fall within compass of a day's business
o no these are too nice observations
they are such as must be received by your favour or it cannot be authentic
troth i can discern no such necessity
no i assure you signior
if those laws you speak of had been delivered us 'ab initio' and in their present virtue and perfection there had been some reason of obeying their powers but 'tis extant that that which we call 'comoedia' was at first nothing but a simple and continued song sung by one only person till susario invented a second after him epicharmus a third phormus and chionides devised to have four actors with a prologue and chorus to which cratinus long after added a fifth and sixth eupolis more aristophanes more than they every man in the dignity of his spirit and judgment supplied something
and though that in him this kind of poem appeared absolute and fully perfect yet how is the face of it changed since in menander philemon cecilius plautus and the rest
who have utterly excluded the chorus altered the property of the persons their names and natures and augmented it with all liberty according to the elegancy and disposition of those times wherein they wrote
i see not then but we should enjoy the same license or free power to illustrate and heighten our invention as they did and not be tied to those strict and regular forms which the niceness of a few who are nothing but form would thrust upon us
well we will not dispute of this now but what's his scene
marry 'insula fortunata' sir
o the fortunate island mass he has bound himself to a strict law there
he cannot lightly alter the scene without crossing the seas
he needs not having a whole island to run through i think
how comes it then that in some one play we see so many seas countries and kingdoms passed over with such admirable dexterity
o that but shews how well the authors can travel in their vocation and outrun the apprehension of their auditory
but leaving this i would they would begin at once this protraction is able to sour the best settled patience in the theatre
they have answered your wish sir they sound
o here comes the prologue
now sir if you had staid a little longer i meant to have spoke your prologue for you i'faith
marry with all my heart sir you shall do it yet and i thank you
nay nay stay stay hear you
you could not have studied to have done me a greater benefit at the instant for i protest to you i am unperfect and had i spoke it i must of necessity have been out
why but do you speak this seriously
ay wit's my help do i and esteem myself indebted to your kindness for it
why for undertaking the prologue for me
did i undertake it for you
i appeal to all these gentlemen whether you did or no
come come it pleases you to cast a strange look on't now but 'twill not serve
'fore me but it must serve and therefore speak your prologue
an i do let me die poisoned with some venomous hiss and never live to look as high as the two penny room again
he has put you to it sir
'sdeath what a humorous fellow is this
gentlemen good faith i can speak no prologue howsoever his weak wit has had the fortune to make this strong use of me here before you but i protest a come come leave these fustian protestations away come i cannot abide these grey headed ceremonies
boy fetch me a glass quickly i may bid these gentlemen welcome give them a health here
i mar'le whose wit it was to put a prologue in yond' sackbut's mouth they might well think he'd be out of tune and yet you'd play upon him too
hang him dull block
o good words good words a well timber'd fellow he would have made a good column an he had been thought on when the house was a building o art thou come
well said give me boy fill so
here's a cup of wine sparkles like a diamond
gentlewomen i am sworn to put them in first and gentlemen around in place of a bad prologue i drink this good draught to your health here canary the very elixir and spirit of wine
this is that our poet calls castalian liquor when he comes abroad now and then once in a fortnight and makes a good meal among players where he has 'caninum appetitum' marry at home he keeps a good philosophical diet beans and butter milk an honest pure rogue he will take you off three four five of these one after another and look villainously when he has done like a one headed cerberus
he does not hear me i hope
and then when his belly is well ballaced and his brain rigged a little he snails away withal as though he would work wonders when he comes home
he has made a play here and he calls it 'every man out of his humour' but an he get me out of the humour he has put me in i'll trust none of his tribe again while i live
gentles all i can say for him is you are welcome
i could wish my bottle here amongst you but there's an old rule no pledging your own health
marry if any here be thirsty for it their best way that i know is sit still seal up their lips and drink so much of the play in at their ears
what may this fellow be cordatus
faith if the time will suffer his description i'll give it you
he is one the author calls him carlo buffone an impudent common jester a violent railer and an incomprehensible epicure one whose company is desired of all men but beloved of none he will sooner lose his soul than a jest and profane even the most holy things to excite laughter no honourable or reverend personage whatsoever can come within the reach of his eye but is turned into all manner of variety by his adulterate similes
you paint forth a monster
he will prefer all countries before his native and thinks he can never sufficiently or with admiration enough deliver his affectionate conceit of foreign atheistical policies
but stay observe these he'll appear himself anon
o this is your envious man macilente i think
a "viri est fortunae caecitatem facile ferre
" 'tis true but stoic where in the vast world doth that man breathe that can so much command his blood and his affection
well i see i strive in vain to cure my wounded soul for every cordial that my thoughts apply turns to a corsive and doth eat it farther
there is no taste in this philosophy 'tis like a potion that a man should drink but turns his stomach with the sight of it
i am no such pill'd cynick to believe that beggary is the only happiness or with a number of these patient fools to sing "my mind to me a kingdom is" when the lank hungry belly barks for food i look into the world and there i meet with objects that do strike my blood shot eyes into my brain where when i view myself having before observ'd this man is great mighty and fear'd that lov'd and highly favour'd a third thought wise and learn'd a fourth rich and therefore honour'd a fifth rarely featur'd a sixth admired for his nuptial fortunes when i see these i say and view myself i wish the organs of my sight were crack'd and that the engine of my grief could cast mine eyeballs like two globes of wildfire forth to melt this unproportion'd frame of nature
oh they are thoughts that have transfix'd my heart and often in the strength of apprehension made my cold passion stand upon my face like drops of dew on a stiff cake of ice
this alludes well to that of the poet "invidus suspirat gemit incutitque dentes sudat frigidus intuens quod odit
" o peace you break the scene
soft who be these
i'll lay me down awhile till they be past
signior note this gallant i pray you
a tame rook you'll take him presently list
nay look you carlo this is my humour now
i have land and money my friends left me well and i will be a gentleman whatsoever it cost me
a most gentlemanlike resolution
an i take an humour of a thing once i am like your tailor's needle i go through but for my name signior how think you
will it not serve for a gentleman's name when the signior is put to it ha
let me hear how is it
signior insulso sogliardo methinks it sounds well
an all fitted to your name you might very well stand for a gentleman i know many sogliardos gentlemen
why and for my wealth i might be a justice of peace
ay and a constable for your wit
all this is my lordship you see here and those farms you came by
good steps to gentility too marry but sogliardo if you affect to be a gentleman indeed you must observe all the rare qualities humours and compliments of a gentleman
i know it signior and if you please to instruct i am not too good to learn i'll assure you
i'll make admirable use in the projection of my medicine upon this lump of copper here
i'll bethink me for you sir
signior i will both pay you and pray you and thank you and think on you
is this not purely good
s'blood why should such a prick ear'd hind as this be rich ha
such a transparent gull that may be seen through
wherefore should he have land houses and lordships
o i could eat my entrails and sink my soul into the earth with sorrow
first to be an accomplished gentleman that is a gentleman of the time you must give over housekeeping in the country and live altogether in the city amongst gallants where at your first appearance 'twere good you turn'd four or five hundred acres of your best land into two or three trunks of apparel you may do it without going to a conjurer and be sure you mix yourself still with such as flourish in the spring of the fashion and are least popular study their carriage and behaviour in all learn to play at primero and passage and ever when you lose have two or three peculiar oaths to swear by that no man else swears but above all protest in your play and affirm "upon your credit as you are a true gentleman" at every cast you may do it with a safe conscience i warrant you
he cannot choose but be a gentleman that has these excellent gifts more more i beseech you
you must endeavour to feed cleanly at your ordinary sit melancholy and pick your teeth when you cannot speak and when you come to plays be humorous look with a good starch'd face and ruffle your brow like a new boot laugh at nothing but your own jests or else as the noblemen laugh
that's a special grace you must observe
i warrant you sir
ay and sit on the stage and flout provided you have a good suit
o i'll have a suit only for that sir
you must talk much of your kindred and allies
no signior i shall not need to do so i have kindred in the city to talk of i have a niece is a merchant's wife and a nephew my brother sordido's son of the inns of court
o but you must pretend alliance with courtiers and great persons and ever when you are to dine or sup in any strange presence hire a fellow with a great chain though it be copper it's no matter to bring you letters feign'd from such a nobleman or such a knight or such a lady "to their worshipful right rare and nobly qualified friend and kinsman signior insulso sogliardo" give yourself style enough
and there while you intend circumstances of news or enquiry of their health or so one of your familiars whom you must carry about you still breaks it up as 'twere in a jest and reads it publicly at the table at which you must seem to take as unpardonable offence as if he had torn your mistress's colours or breath'd upon her picture and pursue it with that hot grace as if you would advance a challenge upon it presently
stay i do not like that humour of challenge it may be accepted but i'll tell you what's my humour now i will do this i will take occasion of sending one of my suits to the tailor's to have the pocket repaired or so and there such a letter as you talk of broke open and all shall be left o the tailor will presently give out what i am upon the reading of it worth twenty of your gallants
but then you must put on an extreme face of discontentment at your man's negligence
o so i will and beat him too i'll have a man for the purpose
you may you have land and crowns o partial fate
mass well remember'd you must keep your men gallant at the first fine pied liveries laid with good gold lace there's no loss in it they may rip it off and pawn it when they lack victuals
by 'r lady that is chargeable signior 'twill bring a man in debt
why that's the more for your credit sir it's an excellent policy to owe much in these days if you note it
as how good signior
i would fain be a politician
look where you are indebted any great sum your creditor observes you with no less regard than if he were bound to you for some huge benefit and will quake to give you the least cause of offence lest he lose his money
i assure you in these times no man has his servant more obsequious and pliant than gentlemen their creditors to whom if at any time you pay but a moiety or a fourth part it comes more acceptably than if you gave them a new year's gift
i perceive you sir i will take up and bring myself in credit sure
marry this always beware you commerce not with bankrupts or poor needy ludgathians they are impudent creatures turbulent spirits they care not what violent tragedies they stir nor how they play fast and loose with a poor gentleman's fortunes to get their own
marry these rich fellows that have the world or the better part of it sleeping in their counting houses they are ten times more placable they either fear hope or modesty restrains them from offering any outrages but this is nothing to your followers you shall not run a penny more in arrearage for them an you list yourself
how should i keep 'em then
'sblood let them keep themselves they are no sheep are they
what you shall come in houses where plate apparel jewels and divers other pretty commodities lie negligently scattered and i would have those mercuries follow me i trow should remember they had not their fingers for nothing
that's not so good methinks
why after you have kept them a fortnight or so and shew'd them enough to the world you may turn them away and keep no more but a boy it's enough
nay my humour is not for boys i'll keep men an i keep any and i'll give coats that's my humour but i lack a cullisen
why now you ride to the city you may buy one i'll bring you where you shall have your choice for money
o ay you shall have one take measure of you and make you a coat of arms to fit you of what fashion you will
by word of mouth i thank you signior i'll be once a little prodigal in a humour i'faith and have a most prodigious coat
break head and brain at once to be deliver'd of your fighting issue
who can endure to see blind fortune dote thus
to be enamour'd on this dusty turf this clod a whoreson puck fist
i could run wild with grief now to behold the rankness of her bounties that doth breed such bulrushes these mushroom gentlemen that shoot up in a night to place and worship
let him alone some stray some stray
nay i will examine him before i go sure
the lord of the soil has all wefts and strays here has he not
faith then i pity the poor fellow he's fallen into a fool's hands
sirrah who gave you a commission to lie in my lordship
do you know me sir
i do know you sir
he answers him like an echo
why who am i sir
one of those that fortune favours
the periphrasis of a fool
i'll observe this better
how mean you that friend
i mean simply that you are one that lives not by your wits
no sir i scorn to live by my wits i have better means i tell thee than to take such base courses as to live by my wits
what dost thou think i live by my wits
methinks jester you should not relish this well
does he know me
though yours be the worst use a man can put his wit to of thousands to prostitute it at every tavern and ordinary yet methinks you should have turn'd your broadside at this and have been ready with an apology able to sink this hulk of ignorance into the bottom and depth of his contempt
signior you are well encountered how is it
o we must not regard what he says man a trout a shallow fool he has no more brain than a butterfly a mere stuft suit he looks like a musty bottle new wicker'd his head's the cork light light
i am glad to see you so well return'd signior
is he one of your acquaintance
i love him the better for that
od's precious come away man what do you mean
an you knew him as i do you'd shun him as you would do the plague
o he's a black fellow take heed of him
is he a scholar or a soldier
both both a lean mongrel he looks as if he were chop fallen with barking at other men's good fortunes 'ware how you offend him he carries oil and fire in his pen will scald where it drops his spirit is like powder quick violent he'll blow a man up with a jest i fear him worse than a rotten wall does the cannon shake an hour after at the report
away come not near him
for god's sake let's be gone an he be a scholar you know i cannot abide him i had as lieve see a cockatrice specially as cockatrices go now
what you'll stay signior
this gentleman sogliardo and i are to visit the knight puntarvolo and from thence to the city we shall meet there
ay when i cannot shun you we will meet
of all the creatures i have seen i envy not this buffone for indeed neither his fortunes nor his parts deserve it but i do hate him as i hate the devil or that brass visaged monster barbarism
o 'tis an open throated black mouth'd cur that bites at all but eats on those that feed him
a slave that to your face will serpent like creep on the ground as he would eat the dust and to your back will turn the tail and sting more deadly than the scorpion stay who's this
now for my soul another minion of the old lady chance's
good good good good good
i thank my stars i thank my stars for it
said i not true
doth not his passion speak out of my divination
o my senses why lost you not your powers and become dull'd if not deaded with this spectacle
i know him it is sordido the farmer a boor and brother to that swine was here
as i would wish as i would wish
see how the strumpet fortune tickles him and makes him swoon with laughter o o ha ha ha

" inclining to rain" inclining to rain

'slid stay this is worse and worse what says he of st
turn back look "saint swithin's no rain
" o here's a precious dirty damned rogue that fats himself with expectation of rotten weather and unseason'd hours and he is rich for it an elder brother

o 'tis well ha ha ha
a plague consume thee and thy house
swithin's the day variable weather for the most part rain" good
"for the most part rain" why it should rain forty days after now more or less it was a rule held afore i was able to hold a plough and yet here are two days no rain ha

blest be the hour wherein i bought this book his studies happy that composed the book and the man fortunate that sold the book
sleep with this charm and be as true to me as i am joy'd and confident in thee a a ha ha ha
is not this good
is not pleasing this
is't possible that such a spacious villain should live and not be plagued
or lies be hid within the wrinkled bosom of the world where heaven cannot see him
methinks 'tis rare and strange that he should breathe and walk feed with digestion sleep enjoy his health and like a boisterous whale swallowing the poor still swim in wealth and pleasure
unless his house and skin were thunder proof i wonder at it
methinks now the hectic gout leprosy or some such loath'd disease might light upon him of that fire from heaven might fall upon his barns or mice and rats eat up his grain or else that it might rot within the hoary ricks even as it stands methinks this might be well and after all the devil might come and fetch him
meantime he surfeits in prosperity and thou in envy of him gnaw'st thyself peace fool get hence and tell thy vexed spirit wealth in this age will scarcely look on merit
who brought this same sirrah
marry sir one of the justice's men he says 'tis a precept and all their hands be at it
ay and the prints of them stick in my flesh deeper than in their letters they have sent me pills wrapt in paper here that should i take them would poison all the sweetness of my book and turn my honey into hemlock juice
but i am wiser than to serve their precepts or follow their prescriptions
here's a device to charge me bring my grain unto the markets ay much
when i have neither barn nor garner nor earth to hid it in i'll bring 't till then each corn i send shall be as big as paul's
o but say some the poor are like to starve
why let 'em starve what's that to me
are bees bound to keep life in drones and idle moths
no why such are these that term themselves the poor only because they would be pitied but are indeed a sort of lazy beggars licentious rogues and sturdy vagabonds bred by the sloth of a fat plenteous year like snakes in heat of summer out of dung and this is all that these cheap times are good for whereas a wholesome and penurious dearth purges the soil of such vile excrements and kills the vipers up
o but master take heed they hear you not
they will exclaim against you
ay their exclaims move me as much as thy breath moves a mountain
poor worms they hiss at me whilst i at home can be contented to applaud myself to sit and clap my hands and laugh and leap knocking my head against my roof with joy to see how plump my bags are and my barns
sirrah go hie you home and bid your fellows get all their flails ready again i come
i'll instantly set all my hinds to thrashing of a whole rick of corn which i will hide under the ground and with the straw thereof i'll stuff the outsides of my other mows that done i'll have them empty all my garners and in the friendly earth bury my store that when the searchers come they may suppose all's spent and that my fortunes were belied
and to lend more opinion to my want and stop that many mouthed vulgar dog which else would still be baying at my door each market day i will be seen to buy part of the purest wheat as for my household where when it comes it shall increase my heaps 'twill yield me treble gain at this dear time promised in this dear book i have cast all
till then i will not sell an ear i'll hang first
o i shall make my prices as i list my house and i can feed on peas and barley
what though a world of wretches starve the while he that will thrive must think no courses vile
now signior how approve you this
have the humourists exprest themselves truly or no
yes if it be well prosecuted 'tis hitherto happy enough but methinks macilente went hence too soon he might have been made to stay and speak somewhat in reproof of sordido's wretchedness now at the last
o no that had been extremely improper besides he had continued the scene too long with him as 'twas being in no more action
you may inforce the length as a necessary reason but for propriety the scene wou'd very well have borne it in my judgment
o worst of both why you mistake his humour utterly then
how do i mistake it
is it not envy
yes but you must understand signior he envies him not as he is a villain a wolf in the commonwealth but as he is rich and fortunate for the true condition of envy is 'dolor alienae felicitatis' to have our eyes continually fixed upon another man's prosperity that is his chief happiness and to grieve at that
whereas if we make his monstrous and abhorr'd actions our object the grief we take then comes nearer the nature of hate than envy as being bred out of a kind of contempt and loathing in ourselves
so you'll infer it had been hate not envy in him to reprehend the humour of sordido
right for what a man truly envies in another he could always love and cherish in himself but no man truly reprehends in another what he loves in himself therefore reprehension is out of his hate
and this distinction hath he himself made in a speech there if you marked it where he says envy not this buffone but i hate him
" why might he not as well have hated sordido as him
no sir there was subject for his envy in sordido his wealth so was there not in the other
he stood possest of no one eminent gift but a most odious and fiend like disposition that would turn charity itself into hate much more envy for the present
you have satisfied me sir
o here comes the fool and the jester again methinks
'twere pity they should be parted sir
what bright shining gallant's that with them
the knight they went to
no sir this is one monsieur fastidious brisk otherwise called the fresh frenchified courtier
as humorous as quicksilver do but observe him the scene is the country still remember
cinedo watch when the knight comes and give us word
how lik'st thou my boy carlo
he looks like a colonel of the pigmies horse or one of these motions in a great antique clock he would shew well upon a haberdasher's stall at a corner shop rarely
'sheart what a damn'd witty rogue's this
how he confounds with his similes
better with similes than smiles and whither were you riding now signior
who what a silly jest's that
whither should i ride but to the court
o pardon me sir twenty places more your hot house or your whore house by the virtue of my soul this knight dwells in elysium here
he's gone now i thought he would fly out presently
these be our nimble spirited catsos that have their evasions at pleasure will run over a bog like your wild irish no sooner started but they'll leap from one thing to another like a squirrel heigh
dance and do tricks in their discourse from fire to water from water to air from air to earth as if their tongues did but e'en lick the four elements over and away
sirrah carlo thou never saw'st my gray hobby yet didst thou
no have you such a one
the best in europe my good villain thou'lt say when thou seest him
but when shall i see him
there was a nobleman in the court offered me a hundred pound for him by this light a fine little fiery slave he runs like a oh excellent excellent
with the very sound of the spur
the sound of the spur
o it's your only humour now extant sir a good gingle a good gingle
you shall see him turn morrice dancer he has got him bells a good suit and a hobby horse
signior now you talk of a hobby horse i know where one is will not be given for a brace of angels
how is that sir
marry sir i am telling this gentleman of a hobby horse it was my father's indeed and though i say it that should not say it on on
he did dance in it with as good humour and as good regard as any man of his degree whatsoever being no gentleman i have danc'd in it myself too
not since the humour of gentility was upon you did you
yes once marry that was but to shew what a gentleman might do in a humour
why this fellow's discourse were nothing but for the word humour
o bear with him an he should lack matter and words too 'twere pitiful
nay look you sir there's ne'er a gentleman in the country has the like humours for the hobby horse as i have i have the method for the threading of the needle and all the how the method
ay the leigerity for that and the whighhie and the daggers in the nose and the travels of the egg from finger to finger and all the humours incident to the quality
the horse hangs at home in my parlour
i'll keep it for a monument as long as i live sure
do so and when you die 'twill be an excellent trophy to hang over your tomb
mass and i'll have a tomb now i think on't 'tis but so much charges
best build it in your lifetime then your heirs may hap to forget it else
nay i mean so i'll not trust to them
no for heirs and executors are grown damnable careless 'specially since the ghosts of testators left walking
how like you him signior
'fore heavens his humour arrides me exceedingly
ay pleases me a pox on't
i am so haunted at the court and at my lodging with your refined choice spirits that it makes me clean of another garb another sheaf i know not how
i cannot frame me to your harsh vulgar phrase 'tis against my genius
this is right to that of horace "dum vitant stulti vitia in contraria currunt" so this gallant labouring to avoid popularity falls into a habit of affectation ten thousand times hatefuller than the former
a gull a fool no salt in him i' the earth man he looks like a fresh salmon kept in a tub he'll be spent shortly
his brain's lighter than his feather already and his tongue more subject to lye than that is to wag he sleeps with a musk cat every night and walks all day hang'd in pomander chains for penance he has his skin tann'd in civet to make his complexion strong and the sweetness of his youth lasting in the sense of his sweet lady a good empty puff he loves you well signior
there shall be no love lost sir i'll assure you
nay carlo i am not happy in thy love i see pray thee suffer me to enjoy thy company a little sweet mischief by this air i shall envy this gentleman's place in thy affections if you be thus private i'faith
is the knight arrived
no sir but 'tis guess'd he will arrive presently by his fore runners
by minerva an excellent figure a good boy
you should give him a french crown for it the boy would find two better figures in that and a good figure of your bounty beside
tut the boy wants no crowns
no crown speak in the singular number and we'll believe you
nay thou are so capriciously conceited now
sirrah damnation i have heard this knight puntarvolo reported to be a gentleman of exceeding good humour thou know'st him prithee how is his disposition
i never was so favoured of my stars as to see him yet
boy do you look to the hobby
ay sir the groom has set him up
'tis well i rid out of my way of intent to visit him and take knowledge of his nay good wickedness his humour his humour
why he loves dogs and hawks and his wife well he has a good riding face and he can sit a great horse he will taint a staff well at tile when he is mounted he looks like the sign of the george that's all i know save that instead of a dragon he will brandish against a tree and break his sword as confidently upon the knotty bark as the other did upon the scales of the beast
o but this is nothing to that's delivered of him
they say he has dialogues and discourses between his horse himself and his dog and that he will court his own lady as she were a stranger never encounter'd before
ay that he will and make fresh love to her every morning this gentleman has been a spectator of it signior insulso
i am resolute to keep a page
you have seen signior puntarvolo accost his lady
and how is the manner of it prithee good signior
faith sir in very good sort he has his humours for it sir at first suppose he were now to come from riding or hunting or so he has his trumpet to sound and then the waiting gentlewoman she looks out and then he speaks and then she speaks very pretty i'faith gentlemen
why but do you remember no particulars signior
o yes sir first the gentlewoman she looks out at the window
after the trumpet has summon'd a parle not before
no sir not before and then says he ha ha ha ha
be not rapt so
says he ha ha ha ha
says he god save you says he ha ha
was this the ridiculous motive to all this passion
nay that that comes after is ha ha ha ha
doubtless he apprehends more than he utters this fellow or else a list list they are come from hunting stand by close under this terras and you shall see it done better than i can show it
so it had need 'twill scarce poise the observation else
faith i remember all but the manner of it is quite out of my head
o withdraw withdraw it cannot be but a most pleasing object
a forester give wind to thy horn
enough by this the sound hath touch'd the ears of the inclos'd depart leave the dog and take with thee what thou has deserved the horn and thanks
ay marry there is some taste in this
ah peace now above now above
a stay mine eye hath on the instant through the bounty of the window received the form of a nymph
i will step forward three paces of the which i will barely retire one and after some little flexure of the knee with an erected grace salute her one two and three
sweet lady god save you
no forsooth i am but the waiting gentlewoman
he knew that before
pardon me 'humanum est errare'
he learn'd that of his chaplain
to the perfection of compliment which is the dial of the thought and guided by the sun of your beauties are required these three specials the gnomon the puntilios and the superficies the superficies is that we call place the puntilios circumstance and the gnomon ceremony in either of which for a stranger to err 'tis easy and facile and such am true not knowing her horizon he must needs err which i fear he knows too well
what call you the lord of the castle sweet face
the lord of the castle is a knight sir signior puntarvolo
o now must he ruminate
does the wench know him all this while then
o do you know me man
why therein lies the syrup of the jest it's a project a designment of his own a thing studied and rehearst as ordinarily at his coming from hawking or hunting as a jig after a play
ay e'en like your jig sir
'tis a most sumptuous and stately edifice
of what years is the knight fair damsel
faith much about your years sir
what complexion or what stature bears he
of your stature and very near upon your complexion
mine is melancholy so is the dog's just
and doth argue constancy chiefly in love
what are his endowments
o the most courteous knight in christian land sir
as the skin between your brows sir
'slud he takes an inventory of his own good parts
ay sir i would you should know it the poor are served at his gate early and late sir
o ay sir he can speak the french and italian
then he has travelled
ay forsooth he hath been beyond seas once or twice
as far as paris to fetch over a fashion and come back again
i know not what you call religious but he goes to church i am sure
'slid methinks these answers should offend him
tut no he knows they are excellent and to her capacity that speaks them
would i might but see his face
she should let down a glass from the window at that word and request him to look in't
doubtless the gentleman is most exact and absolutely qualified doth the castle contain him
no sir he is from home but his lady is within
what is she fair splendidious and amiable
prithee dear nymph intreat her beauties to shine on this side of the building
that he may erect a new dial of compliment with his gnomons and his puntilios
nay thou art such another cynic now a man had need walk uprightly before thee
heart can any man walk more upright than he does
look look as if he went in a frame or had a suit of wainscot on and the dog watching him lest he should leap out on't
well an e'er i meet him in the city i'll have him jointed i'll pawn him in eastcheap among the butchers else
peace who be these carlo
yonder's your godfather do your duty to him son
a poor elder brother of mine sir a yeoman may dispend some seven or eight hundred a year that's his son my nephew there
you are not ill come neighbour sordido though i have not yet said well come what my godson is grown a great proficient by this
i hope he will grow great one day sir
what does he study
ay sir he is a gentleman though his father be but a yeoman
what call you your nephew signior
marry his name is fungoso
o he look'd somewhat like a sponge in that pink'd yellow doublet methought well make much of him i see he was never born to ride upon a mule
my lady will come presently sir
stand by retire yourselves a space nay pray you forget not the use of your hat the air is piercing
will not their presence prevail against the current of his humour
o no it's a mere flood a torrent carries all afore it
what more than heavenly pulchritude is this
what magazine or treasury of bliss
dazzle you organs to my optic sense to view a creature of such eminence o i am planet struck and in yon sphere a brighter star than venus doth appear
an extacy an extacy man
is your desire to speak with me sir knight
he will tell you that anon neither his brain nor his body are yet moulded for an answer
most debonair and luculent lady i decline me as low as the basis of your altitude
he makes congies to his wife in geometrical proportions
is it possible there should be any such humorist
very easily possible sir you see there is
i have scarce collected my spirits but lately scattered in the administration of your form to which if the bounties of your mind be any way responsible i doubt not but my desires shall find a smooth and secure passage
i am a poor knight errant lady that hunting in the adjacent forest was by adventure in the pursuit of a hart brought to this place which hart dear madam escaped by enchantment the evening approaching myself and servant wearied my suit is to enter your fair castle and refresh me
sir knight albeit it be not usual with me chiefly in the absence of a husband to admit any entrance to strangers yet in the true regard of those innated virtues and fair parts which so strive to express themselves in you i am resolved to entertain you to the best of my unworthy power which i acknowledge to be nothing valued with what so worthy a person may deserve
please you but stay while i descend
most admired lady you astonish me
with speaking a speech of your own penning
nay look prithee peace
i am impatient of such foppery
o let us hear the rest
a tedious chapter of courtship after sir lancelot and queen guenever
i marle in what dull cold nook he found this lady out that being a woman she was blest with no more copy of wit but to serve his humour thus
'slud i think he feeds her with porridge i she could never have such a thick brain else
why is porridge so hurtful signior
o nothing under heaven more prejudicial to those ascending subtle powers or doth sooner abate that which we call 'acumen ingenii' than your gross fare why i'll make you an instance your city wives but observe 'em you have not more perfect true fools in the world bred than they are generally and yet you see by the fineness and delicacy of their diet diving into the fat capons drinking your rich wines feeding on larks sparrows potato pies and such good unctuous meats how their wits are refined and rarified and sometimes a very quintessence of conceit flows from them able to drown a weak apprehension
peace here comes the lady
gad's me here's company
'slight our presence has cut off the convoy of the jest
all the better i am glad on't for the issue was very perspicuous
come let's discover and salute the knight
stay who be these that address themselves towards us
now by the sincerity of my soul welcome welcome gentlemen and how dost thou thou 'grand scourge' or 'second untruss of the time'
faith spending my metal in this reeling world here and there as the sway of my affection carries me and perhaps stumble upon a yeoman feuterer as i do now or one of fortune's mules laden with treasure and an empty cloak bag following him gaping when a gab will untie
peace you bandog peace
what brisk nymphadoro is that in the white virgin boot there
marry sir one that i must interest you to take a very particular knowledge of and with more than ordinary respect monsieur fastidious
sir i could wish that for the time of your vouchsafed abiding here and more real entertainment this is my house stood on the muses hill and these my orchards were those of the hesperides
i possess as much in your wish sir as if i were made lord of the indies and i pray you believe it
i have a better opinion of his faith than to think it will be so corrupted
come brother i'll bring you acquainted with gentlemen and good fellows such as shall do you more grace than brother i hunger not for such acquaintance do you take heed lest husht
my brother sir for want of education sir somewhat nodding to the boor the clown but i request you in private sir
by heaven it is a very fine suit of clothes
do you observe that signior
there's another humour has new crack'd the shell
he is enamour'd of the fashion is he
o you forestall the jest
i marle what it might stand him in
'fore me it's an excellent suit and as neatly becomes him
what said you uncle
when saw you my niece
marry yesternight i supp'd there
that kind of boot does very rare too
and what news hear you
the gilt spur and all
would i were hang'd but 'tis exceeding good
your mind is carried away with somewhat else i ask what news you hear
troth we hear none
in good faith i was never so pleased with a fashion days of my life
o an i might have but my wish i'd ask no more of heaven now but such a suit such a hat such a band such a doublet such a hose such a boot and such a they say there's a new motion of the city of nineveh with jonas and the whale to be seen at fleet bridge
you can tell cousin
here's such a world of questions with him now
yes i think there be such a thing i saw the picture
would he would once be satisfied
let me see the doublet say fifty shillings the doublet and between three or four pound the hose then boots hat and band some ten or eleven pound will do it all and suit me for the heavens
i'll see all those devices an i come to london once
ods 'slid an i could compass it 'twere rare hark you uncle
what says my nephew
faith uncle i would have desired you to have made a motion for me to my father in a thing that walk aside and i'll tell you sir no more but this there's a parcel of law books some twenty pounds worth that lie in a place for a little more than half the money they cost and i think for some twelve pound or twenty mark i could go near to redeem them there's plowden dyar brooke and fitz herbert divers such as i must have ere long and you know i were as good save five or six pound as not uncle
i pray you move it for me
that i will when would you have me do it
o ay i pray you good uncle send me good luck lord an't be thy will prosper it
o my stars now now if it take now i am made for ever
shall i tell you sir
by this air i am the most beholden to that lord of any gentleman living he does use me the most honourably and with the greatest respect more indeed than can be utter'd with any opinion of truth
then have you the count gratiato
as true noble a gentleman too as any breathes i am exceedingly endear'd to his love by this hand i protest to you signior i speak it not gloriously nor out of affectation but there's he and the count frugale signior illustre signior luculento and a sort of 'em that when i am at court they do share me amongst them happy is he can enjoy me most private
i do wish myself sometime an ubiquitary for their love in good faith
there's ne'er a one of them but might lie a week on the rack ere they could bring forth his name and yet he pours them out as familiarly as if he had seen them stand by the fire in the presence or ta'en tobacco with them over the stage in the lord's room
then you must of necessity know our court star there that planet of wit madona saviolina
o lord sir my mistress
is she your mistress
faith here be some slight favours of hers sir that do speak it she is as this scarf sir or this ribbon in my ear or so this feather grew in her sweet fan sometimes though now it be my poor fortune to wear it as you see sir slight slight a foolish toy
well she is the lady of a most exalted and ingenious spirit
did you ever hear any woman speak like her
or enriched with a more plentiful discourse
nothing but sound sound a mere echo she speaks as she goes tired in cobweb lawn light thin good enough to catch flies withal
o manage your affections
well if thou be'st not plagued for this blasphemy one day come regard not a jester it is in the power of my purse to make him speak well or ill of me
sir i affirm it to you upon my credit and judgment she has the most harmonious and musical strain of wit that ever tempted a true ear and yet to see
a rude tongue would profane heaven if it could
i am not ignorant of it sir
oh it flows from her like nectar and she doth give it that sweet quick grace and exornation in the composure that by this good air as i am an honest man would i might never stir sir but she does observe as pure a phrase and use as choice figures in her ordinary conferences as any be in the 'arcadia'
or rather in green's works whence she may steal with more security
well if ten pound will fetch 'em you shall have it but i'll part with no more
i'll try what that will do if you please
do so and when you have them study hard
an i could study to get forty shillings more now
well i will put myself into the fashion as far as this will go presently
i wonder it rains not the almanack says we should have a store of rain to day
why sir to morrow i will associate you to court myself and from thence to the city about a business a project i have i will expose it to you sir carlo i am sure has heard of it
i do intend this year of jubilee coming on to travel and because i will not altogether go upon expense i am determined to put forth some five thousand pound to be paid me five for one upon the return of myself my wife and my dog from the turk's court in constantinople
if all or either of us miscarry in the journey 'tis gone if we be successful why there will be five and twenty thousand pound to entertain time withal
nay go not neighbour sordido stay to night and help to make our society the fuller
i was thinking on your project sir an you call it so
is this the dog goes with you
this is the dog sir
he does not go barefoot does he
away you traitor away
nay afore god i speak simply he may prick his foot with a thorn and be as much as the whole venture is worth
besides for a dog that never travell'd before it's a huge journey to constantinople
i'll tell you now an he were mine i'd have some present conference with a physician what antidotes were good to give him preservatives against poison for assure you if once your money be out there'll be divers attempts made against the life of the poor animal
thou art still dangerous
is signior deliro's wife your kinswoman
ay sir she is my niece my brother's daughter here and my nephew's sister
do you know her sir
signior deliro her husband is my merchant
ay i have seen this gentleman there often
i cry you mercy sir let me crave your name pray you
good signior fungoso i shall request to know you better sir
i am her brother sir
in fair time sir
come gentlemen i will be your conduct
nay pray you sir we shall meet at signior deliro's often
you shall have me at the herald's office sir for some week or so at my first coming up
methinks cordatus he dwelt somewhat too long on this scene it hung in the hand
i see not where he could have insisted less and to have made the humours perspicuous enough
true as his subject lies but he might have altered the shape of his argument and explicated them better in single scenes
that had been single indeed
why be they not the same persons in this as they would have been in those
and is it not an object of more state to behold the scene full and relieved with variety of speakers to the end than to see a vast empty stage and the actors come in one by one as if they were dropt down with a feather into the eye of the spectators
nay you are better traded with these things than i and therefore i'll subscribe to your judgment marry you shall give me leave to make objections
it is the special intent of the author you should do so for thereby others that are present may as well be satisfied who haply would object the same you would do
so sir but when appears macilente again
marry he stays but till our silence give him leave here he comes and with him signior deliro a merchant at whose house he is come to sojourn make your own observation now only transfer your thoughts to the city with the scene where suppose they speak
a i'll tell you by and by sir welcome good macilente to my house to sojourn even for ever if my best in cates and every sort of good entreaty may move you stay with me
i thank you sir
and yet the muffled fates had it pleased them might have supplied me from their own full store
without this word thank you' to a fool
i see no reason why that dog call'd chance should fawn upon this fellow more than me i am a man and i have limbs flesh blood bones sinews and a soul as well as he my parts are every way as good as his if i said better why i did not lie
nath'less his wealth but nodding on my wants must make me bow and cry thank you sir'
take heed your mistress see you not
i warrant you sir i'll steal by her softly
nay gentle friend be merry raise your looks out of your bosom i protest by heaven you are the man most welcome in the world
i thank you sir
i know my cue i think
where will you have them burn sir
what she did not see thee
that is well strew strew good fido the freshest flowers so
what means this signior deliro
cast in more frankincense yet more well said
o macilente i have such a wife
so passing fair unkind
but of such worth and right to be unkind since no man can be worthy of her kindness what can there not
no that is as sure as death no man alive
i do not say is not but cannot possibly be worth her kindness nay it is certain let me do her right
how said do her right
as though i could as though this dull gross tongue of mine could utter the rare the true the pure the infinite rights
that sit as high as i can look within her
this is such dotage as was never heard
well this must needs be granted
nay macilente do not so discredit the goodness of your judgment to deny it
for i do speak the very least of her and i would crave and beg no more of heaven for all my fortunes here but to be able to utter first in fit terms what she is and then the true joys i conceive in her
is't possible she should deserve so well as you pretend
ay and she knows so well her own deserts that when i strive t'enjoy them she weighs the things i do with what she merits and seeing my worth out weigh'd so in her graces she is so solemn so precise so froward that no observance i can do to her can make her kind to me if she find fault i mend that fault and then she says i faulted that i did mend it
now good friend advise me how i may temper this strange spleen in her
you are too amorous too obsequious and make her too assured she may command you
when women doubt most of their husbands' loves they are most loving
husbands must take heed they give no gluts of kindness to their wives but use them like their horses whom they feed but half a peck at once and keep them so still with an appetite to that they give them
he that desires to have a loving wife must bridle all the show of that desire be kind not amorous nor bewraying kindness as if love wrought it but considerate duty
offer no love rites but let wives still seek them for when they come unsought they seldom like them
believe me macilente this is gospel
o that a man were his own man so much to rule himself thus
i will strive i'faith to be more strange and careless yet i hope i have now taken such a perfect course to make her kind to me and live contented that i shall find my kindness well return'd and have no need to fight with my affections
she late hath found much fault with every room within my house one was too big she said another was not furnish'd to her mind and so through all all which now i have alter'd
then here she hath a place on my back side wherein she loves to walk and that she said had some ill smells about it now this walk have i before she knows it thus perfumed with herbs and flowers and laid in divers places as 'twere on altars consecrate to her perfumed gloves and delicate chains of amber to keep the air in awe of her sweet nostrils this have i done and this i think will please her
here's a sweet stink indeed
what shall i ever be thus crost and plagued and sick of husband
o my head doth ache as it would cleave asunder with these savours
all my rooms alter'd and but one poor walk that i delighted in and that is made so fulsome with perfumes that i am fear'd my brain doth sweat so i have caught the plague
why gentle wife is now thy walk too sweet
thou said'st of late it had sour airs about it and found'st much fault that i did not correct it
why an i did find fault sir
nay dear wife i know thou hast said thou has loved perfumes no woman better
ay long since perhaps but now that sense is alter'd you would have me like to a puddle or a standing pool to have no motion nor no spirit within me
i am like a pure and sprightly river that moves for ever and yet still the same or fire that burns much wood yet still one flame
but yesterday i saw thee at our garden smelling on roses and on purple flowers and since i hope the humour of thy sense is nothing changed
why those were growing flowers and these within my walk are cut and strewed
but yet they have one scent
in your gross judgment
if you make no difference betwixt the scent of growing flowers and cut ones you have a sense to taste lamp oil i'faith and with such judgment have you changed the chambers leaving no room that i can joy to be in in all your house and now my walk and all you smoke me from as if i were a fox and long belike to drive me quite away well walk you there and i'll walk where i list
what shall i do
o i shall never please her
out on thee dotard
what star ruled his birth that brought him such a star
blind fortune still bestows her gifts on such as cannot use them how long shall i live ere i be so happy to have a wife of this exceeding form
would i had broke a joint when i devised this that should so dislike her
away bear all away
ay do for fear aught that is there should like her
o this man how cunningly he can conceal himself as though he loved nay honour'd and ador'd
why my sweet heart
and looking strangely as if he were as white as innocence
alas you're simple you you cannot change look pale at pleasure and then red with wonder no no not you
'tis pity o' your naturals
i did but cast an amorous eye e'en now upon a pair of gloves that somewhat liked me and straight he noted it and gave command all should be ta'en away
be they my bane then
what sirrah fido bring in those gloves again you took from hence
'sbody sir but do not bring in no gloves to spite me if you do ay me most wretched how am i misconstrued
o how she tempts my heart strings with her eye to knit them to her beauties or to break
what mov'd the heavens that they could not make me such a woman
but a man a beast that hath no bliss like others
would to heaven in wreak of my misfortunes i were turn'd to some fair water nymph that set upon the deepest whirl pit of the rav'nous seas my adamantine eyes might headlong hale this iron world to me and drown it all
behold behold the translated gallant
o he is welcome
save you brother and sister save you sir
i have commendations for you out o' the country
i wonder they take no knowledge of my suit mine uncle sogliardo is in town
sister methinks you are melancholy why are you so sad
i think you took me for master fastidious brisk sister did you not
why should i take you for him
i was lately in master fastidious's company and methinks we are very like
you have a fair suit brother 'give you joy on't
faith good enough to ride in brother i made it to ride in

troth sister i was fain to borrow these spurs i have left my gown in the gage for them pray you lend me an angel
now beshrew my heart then
good truth i'll pay you again at my next exhibition
i had but bare ten pound of my father and it would not reach to put me wholly into the fashion
i had spurs of mine own before but they were not ginglers
monsieur fastidious will be here anon sister
never lend me penny more while you live then and that i'd be loth to say in truth
when did you see him
yesterday i came acquainted with him at sir puntarvolo's nay sweet sister
i fain would know of heaven now why yond fool should wear a suit of satin
that rook that painted jay with such a deal of outside what is his inside trow
ha ha ha ha ha
good heavens give me patience patience patience
a number of these popinjays there are whom if a man confer and but examine their inward merit with such men as want lord lord what things they are
come when will you pay me again now
a save you signior deliro
how dost thou sweet lady
let me kiss thee
and how does master fastidious brisk
faith live in court signior deliro in grace i thank god both of the noble masculine and feminine
i muse speak with you in private by and by
when you please sir
why look you so pale brother
'slid all this money is cast away now
ay there's a newer edition come forth
'tis but my hard fortune
well i'll have my suit changed
i'll go fetch my tailor presently but first i'll devise a letter to my father
have you any pen and ink sister
what would you do withal
i would use it
'slight an it had come but four days sooner the fashion
there was a countess gave me her hand to kiss to day i' the presence did me more good by that light than and yesternight sent her coach twice to my lodging to intreat me accompany her and my sweet mistress with some two or three nameless ladies more o i have been graced by them beyond all aim of affection this is her garter my dagger hangs in and they do so commend and approve my apparel with my judicious wearing of it it's above wonder
indeed sir 'tis a most excellent suit and you do wear it as extraordinary
why i'll tell you now in good faith and by this chair which by the grace of god i intend presently to sit in i had three suits in one year made three great ladies in love with me i had other three undid three gentlemen in imitation and other three gat three other gentlemen widows of three thousand pound a year
o believe it sir your good face is the witch and your apparel the spells that bring all the pleasures of the world into their circle
ah the sweet grace of a courtier
well would my father had left me but a good face for my portion yet
though i had shared the unfortunate with that goes with it i had not cared i might have passed for somewhat in the world then
why assure you signior rich apparel has strange virtues it makes him that hath it without means esteemed for an excellent wit he that enjoys it with means puts the world in remembrance of his means it helps the deformities of nature and gives lustre to her beauties makes continual holiday where it shines sets the wits of ladies at work that otherwise would be idle furnisheth your two shilling ordinary takes possession of your stage at your new play and enricheth your oars as scorning to go with your scull
pray you sir add this it gives respect to your fools makes many thieves as many strumpets and no fewer bankrupts
unworthy to speak where he breatheth
a friend of mine sir
by heaven i wonder at you citizens what kind of creatures you are
that you can consort yourselves with such poor seam rent fellows
sir i will assure you however you esteem of him he's a man worthy of regard
why what has he in him of such virtue to be regarded ha
marry he is a scholar sir
and he is well travell'd
he should get him clothes i would cherish those good parts of travel in him and prefer him to some nobleman of good place
sir such a benefit should bine me to you for ever in my friend's right and i doubt not but his desert shall more than answer my praise
why an he had good clothes i'd carry him to court with me to morrow
he shall not want for those sir if gold and the whole city will furnish him
you say well sir faith signior deliro i am come to have you play the alchemist with me and change the species of my land into that metal you talk of
with all my heart sir what sum will serve you
faith some three or four hundred
troth sir i have promised to meet a gentleman this morning in paul's but upon my return i'll dispatch you
i'll accompany you thither
as you please sir but i go not thither directly
'tis no matter i have no other designment in hand and therefore as good go along
i were as good have a quartain fever follow me now for i shall ne'er be rid of him
bring me a cloak there one
still upon his grace at court i am sure to be visited i was a beast to give him any hope
well would i were in that i am out with him once and come signior macilente i must confer with you as we go
nay dear wife i beseech thee forsake these moods look not like winter thus
here take my keys open my counting houses spread all my wealth before thee choose any object that delights thee if thou wilt eat the spirit of gold and drink dissolved pearl in wine 'tis for thee
nay my sweet wife
good lord how you are perfumed in your terms and all
pray you leave us
let thy words ever sound in mine ears and thy graces disperse contentment through all my senses
o how happy is that lady above other ladies that enjoys so absolute a gentleman to her servant
countess gives him her hand to kiss" ah foolish countess
he's a man worthy if a woman may speak of a man's worth to kiss the lips of an empress
what's master fastidious gone sister
he has a face like a cherubin
'ods me what luck's this
i have fetch'd my tailor and all which way went he sister can you tell
not i in good faith and he has a body like an angel
how long is't since he went
why but e'en now did you not meet him
and a tongue able to ravish any woman in the earth
o for god's sake i'll please you for your pains but e'en now say you
come good sir 'slid i had forgot it too if any body ask for mine uncle sogliardo they shall have him at the herald's office yonder by paul's well i will not altogether despair i have heard of a citizen's wife has been beloved of a courtier and why not heigh ho
well i will into my private chamber lock the door to me and think over all his good parts one after another
well i doubt this last scene will endure some grievous torture
you fear 'twill be rack'd by some hard construction
no in good faith unless mine eyes could light me beyond sense
i see no reason why this should be more liable to the rack than the rest you'll say perhaps the city will not take it well that the merchant is made here to doat so perfectly upon his wife and she again to be so 'fastidiously' affected as she is
you have utter'd my thought sir indeed
why by that proportion the court might as well take offence at him we call the courtier and with much more pretext by how much the place transcends and goes before in dignity and virtue but can you imagine that any noble or true spirit in court whose sinewy and altogether unaffected graces very worthily express him a courtier will make any exception at the opening of such as empty trunk as this brisk is
or think his own worth impeached by beholding his motley inside
no sir i do not
no more assure you will any grave wise citizen or modest matron take the object of this folly in deliro and his wife but rather apply it as the foil to their own virtues
for that were to affirm that a man writing of nero should mean all emperors or speaking of machiavel comprehend all statesmen or in our sordido all farmers and so of the rest than which nothing can be uttered more malicious or absurd
indeed there are a sort of these narrow eyed decypherers i confess that will extort strange and abstruse meanings out of any subject be it never so conspicuous and innocently delivered
but to such where'er they sit concealed let them know the author defies them and their writing tables and hopes no sound or safe judgment will infect itself with their contagious comments who indeed come here only to pervert and poison the sense of what they hear and for nought else
stay what new mute is this that walks so suspiciously
o marry this is one for whose better illustration we must desire you to presuppose the stage the middle aisle in paul's and that the west end of it
so sir and what follows
faith a whole volume of humour and worthy the unclasping
what name do you give him first
he hath shift of names sir some call him apple john some signior whiffe marry his main standing name is cavalier shirt the rest are but as clean shirts to his natures
and what makes he in paul's now
troth as you see for the advancement of a 'si quis' or two wherein he has so varied himself that if any of 'em take he may hull up and down in the humorous world a little longer
it seems then he bears a very changing sail
o as the wind sir here comes more
this is rare i have set up my bills without discovery
what fortune has brought you into these west parts
troth signior nothing but your rheum i have been taking an ounce of tobacco hard by here with a gentleman and i am come to spit private in paul's
adieu good signior whiffe
you are well met when shall we sup together and laugh and be fat with those good wenches ha
faith sir i must now leave you upon a few humours and occasions but when you please sir
farewell sweet apple john
i wonder there are no more store of gallants here
what be these two signior
marry a couple sir that are mere strangers to the whole scope of our play only come to walk a turn or two in this scene of paul's by chance
save you good master clove
ay and they are well met for 'tis as dry an orange as ever grew nothing but salutation and lord sir
" and "it pleases you to say so sir
" one that can laugh at a jest for company with a most plausible and extemporal grade and some hour after in private ask you what it was
the other monsieur clove is a more spiced youth he will sit you a whole afternoon sometimes in a bookseller's shop reading the greek italian and spanish when he understands not a word of either if he had the tongues to his suits he were an excellent linguist
do you hear this reported for certainty
a a sirrah take my cloak and you sir knave follow me closer
if thou losest my dog thou shalt die a dog's death i will hang thee
tut fear him not he's a good lean slave he loves a dog well i warrant him i see by his looks i mass he's somewhat like him
'slud poison him make him away with a crooked pin or somewhat man thou may'st have more security of thy life and so sir what
you have not put out your whole venture yet have you
no i do want yet some fifteen or sixteen hundred pounds but my lady my wife is 'out of her humour' she does not now go
marry i am now enforced to give it out upon the return of myself my dog and my cat
my squire has her there in the bag sirrah look to her
how lik'st thou my change carlo
oh for the better sir your cat has nine lives and your wife has but one
besides she will never be sea sick which will save me so much in conserves
when saw you signior sogliardo
i came from him but now he is at the herald's office yonder he requested me to go afore and take up a man or two for him in paul's against his cognisance was ready
what has he purchased arms then
ay and rare ones too of as many colours as e'er you saw any fool's coat in your life
i'll go look among yond' bills an i can fit him with legs to his arms
with legs to his arms
i will go with you sir
come let's walk in mediterraneo i assure you sir i am not the least respected among ladies but let that pass do you know how to go into the presence sir
why on my feet sir
no on your head sir for 'tis that must bear you out i assure you as thus sir
you must first have an especial care so to wear your hat that it oppress not confusedly this your predominant or foretop because when you come at the presence door you may with once or twice stroking up your forehead thus enter with your predominant perfect that is standing up stiff
as if one were frighted
which indeed a true fear of your mistress should do rather than gum water or whites of eggs is't not so sir
give me leave to crave your name sir
his name is macilente sir
good signior macilente if this gentleman signior deliro furnish you as he says he will with clothes i will bring you to morrow by this time into the presence of the most divine and acute lady in court you shall see sweet silent rhetorick and dumb eloquence speaking in her eye but when she speaks herself such an anatomy of wit so sinewised and arterised that 'tis the goodliest model of pleasure that ever was to behold
she strikes the world into admiration of her o o i cannot express them believe me
o your only admiration is your silence sir
'fore god carlo this is good
let's read them again
"if there be any lady or gentlewoman of good carriage that is desirous to entertain to her private uses a young straight and upright gentleman of the age of five or six and twenty at the most who can serve in the nature of a gentleman usher and hath little legs of purpose and a black satin suit of his own to go before her in which suit for the more sweetening now lies in lavender and can hide his face with her fan if need require or sit in the cold at the stair foot for her as well as another gentleman let her subscribe her name and place and diligent respect shall be given
" this is above measure excellent ha
here's a fine slave
"if this city or the suburbs of the same do afford any young gentleman of the first second or third head more or less whose friends are but lately deceased and whose lands are but new come into his hands that to be as exactly qualified as the best of our ordinary gallants are is affected to entertain the most gentleman like use of tobacco as first to give it the most exquisite perfume then to know all the delicate sweet forms for the assumption of it as also the rare corollary and practice of the cuban ebolition euripus and whiff which he shall receive or take in here at london and evaporate at uxbridge or farther if it please him
if there be any such generous spirit that is truly enamoured of these good faculties may it please him but by a note of his hand to specify the place or ordinary where he uses to eat and lie and most sweet attendance with tobacco and pipes of the best sort shall be ministered
'stet quaeso candide lector
'" why this is without parallel this
well i'll mark this fellow for sogliardo's use presently
or rather sogliardo for his use
faith either of them will serve they are both good properties i'll design the other a place too that we may see him
no better place than the mitre that we may be spectators with you carlo
soft behold who enters here signior sogliardo
save you good sir puntarvolo your dog's in health sir i see how now carlo
we have ta'en simple pains to choose you out followers here
monsieur orange yon gallants observe us prithee let's talk fustian a little and gull them make them believe we are great scholars
nay prithee let us believe me you have an excellent habit in discourse
it pleases you to say so sir
by this church you have la nay come begin aristotle in his daemonologia approves scaliger for the best navigator in his time and in his hypercritics he reports him to be heautontimorumenos you understand the greek sir
for society's sake he does
o here be a couple of fine tame parrots
now sir whereas the ingenuity of the time and the soul's synderisis are but embrions in nature added to the panch of esquiline and the inter vallum of the zodiac besides the ecliptic line being optic and not mental but by the contemplative and theoric part thereof doth demonstrate to us the vegetable circumference and the ventosity of the tropics and whereas our intellectual or mincing capreal according to the metaphysicks as you may read in plato's histriomastix you conceive me sir
then coming to the pretty animal as reason long since is fled to animals you know or indeed for the more modelising or enamelling or rather diamondising of your subject you shall perceive the hypothesis or galaxia whereof the meteors long since had their initial inceptions and notions to be merely pythagorical mathematical and aristocratical for look you sir there is ever a kind of concinnity and species let us turn to our former discourse for they mark us not
mass yonder's the knight puntarvolo
and my cousin sogliardo methinks
ay and his familiar that haunts him the devil with the shining face
let 'em alone observe 'em not
nay i will have him i am resolute for that

in reasonable state sir what citizen is that you were consorted with
a merchant of any worth
'tis signior deliro sir
o what copy of fool would this place minister to one endued with patience to observe it
nay look you sir now you are a gentleman you must carry a more exalted presence change your mood and habit to a more austere form be exceeding proud stand upon your gentility and scorn every man speak nothing humbly never discourse under a nobleman though you never saw him but riding to the star chamber it's all one
love no man trust no man speak ill of no man to his face nor well of any man behind his back
salute fairly on the front and wish them hanged upon the turn
spread yourself upon his bosom publicly whose heart you would eat in private
these be principles think on them i'll come to you again presently
sirrah keep close yet not so close thy breath will thaw my ruff
o good cousin i am a little busy how does my niece
i am to walk with a knight here
o he is here look you sir that's the gentleman
what he in the blush coloured satin
ay he sir though his suit blush he blushes not look you that's the suit sir i would have mine such a suit without difference such stuff such a wing such a sleeve such a skirt belly and all therefore pray you observe it
have you a pair of tables
why do you see sir they say i am fantastical why true i know it and i pursue my humour still in contempt of this censorious age
'slight an a man should do nothing but what a sort of stale judgments about him this town will approve in him he were a sweet ass i'd beg him i'faith
i ne'er knew any more find fault with a fashion than they that knew not how to put themselves into it
for mine own part so i please mine own appetite i am careless what the fusty world speaks of me
do you mark how it hangs at the knee there
i warrant you sir
for god's sake do not all do you see the collar sir
fear nothing it shall not differ in a stitch sir
pray heaven it do not
you'll make these linings serve and help me to a chapman for the outside will you
i'll do my best sir you'll put it off presently
ay go with me to my chamber you shall have it but make haste of it for the love of a customer for i'll sit in my old suit or else lie a bed and read the 'arcadia' till you have done
o if ever you were struck with a jest gallants now now now i do usher the most strange piece of military profession that ever was discovered in 'insula paulina'
what is he for a creature
a pimp a pimp that i have observed yonder the rarest superficies of a humour he comes every morning to empty his lungs in paul's here and offers up some five or six hecatombs of faces and sighs and away again
here he comes nay walk walk be not seen to note him and we shall have excellent sport
'slid he vented a sigh e'en now i thought he would have blown up the church
o you shall have him give a number of those false fires ere he depart
see now he is expostulating with his rapier look look
did you ever in your days observe better passion over a hilt
except it were in the person of a cutlet's boy or that the fellow were nothing but vapour i should think it impossible
see again he claps his sword o' the head as who should say well go to
i wonder the blade can contain itself being so provoked
"with that the moody squire thumpt his breast and rear'd his eyen to heaven for revenge
" troth an you be good gentlemen let's make them friends and take up the matter between his rapier and him
nay if you intend that you must lay down the matter for this rapier it seems is in the nature of a hanger on and the good gentleman would happily be rid of him
by my faith and 'tis to be suspected i'll ask him
o here's rich stuff
for life's sake let us go a man would wish himself a senseless pillar rather than view these monstrous prodigies "nil habet infelix paupertas durius in se quam quod ridiculos homines facit " signior
will you sell your rapier
he is turn'd wild upon the question he looks as he had seen a serjeant
now fate bless me
you ask'd me if i would sell my rapier sir
now lord have mercy upon me
amen i say still
'slid sir what should you behold in my face sir that should move you as they say sir to ask me sir if i would sell my rapier
nay let me pray you sir be not moved i protest i would rather have been silent than any way offensive had i known your nature
nay sir for mine own part as i am a man that has serv'd in causes or so so i am not apt to injure any gentleman in the degree of falling foul but sell my rapier
i will tell you sir i have served with this foolish rapier where some of us dare not appear in haste i name no man but let that pass
death to my lungs
this rapier sir has travell'd by my side sir the best part of france and the low country i have seen flushing brill and the hague with this rapier sir in my lord of leicester's time and by god's will he that should offer to disrapier me now i would look you sir you presume to be a gentleman of sort and so likewise your friends here if you have any disposition to travel for the sight of service or so one two or all of you i can lend you letters to divers officers and commanders in the low countries that shall for my cause do you all the good offices that shall pertain or belong to gentleman of your please you to shew the bounty of your mind sir to impart some ten groats or half a crown to our use till our ability be of growth to return it and we shall think oneself 'sblood
i pray you what said he signior
he's a proper man
marry he tells me if i please to shew the bounty of my mind to impart some ten groats to his use or so break his head and give it him
i thought he had been playing o' the jew's trump my rapier
no sir my rapier is my guard my defence my revenue my honour if you cannot impart be secret i beseech you and i will maintain it where there is a grain of dust or a drop of water
hard is the choice when the valiant must eat their arms or clem
no my dear i will not be divorced from thee yet i have ever found thee true as steel and you cannot impart sir
save you gentlemen nevertheless if you have a fancy to it sir prithee away is signior deliro departed
have you seen a pimp outface his own wants better
i commend him that can dissemble them so well
true and having no better a cloak for it than he has neither
od's precious what mischievous luck is this
whither in such haste monsieur fastidious
after my merchant signior deliro sir
o hinder him not he may hap lose his title a good flounder i'faith
what was the difference between that gallant that's gone and you sir
no difference he would have given me five pound for my rapier and i refused it that's all
o was it no otherwise
we thought you had been upon some terms
no other than you saw sir
adieu good master apple john
whiffe and apple john too
heart what will you say if this be the appendix or label to both you indentures
resolve us of it janus thou that look'st every way or thou hercules that has travelled all countries
nay carlo spend not time in invocations now 'tis late
signior here's a gentleman desirous of your name sir
sir my name is cavalier shift i am known sufficiently in this walk sir
i heard your name varied even now as i take it
true sir it pleases the world as i am her excellent tobacconist to give me the style of signior whiffe as i am a poor esquire about the town here they call me master apple john
variety of good names does well sir
ay and good parts to make those good names out of which i imagine yon bills to be yours
sir if i should deny the manuscripts i were worthy to be banish'd the middle aisle for ever
i take your word sir this gentleman has subscribed to them and is most desirous to become your pupil
marry you must use expedition
signior insulso sogliardo this is the professor
in good time sir nay good sir house your head do you profess these sleights in tobacco
i do more than profess sir and if you please to be a practitioner i will undertake in one fortnight to bring you that you shall take it plausibly in any ordinary theatre or the tilt yard if need be in the most popular assembly that is
but you cannot bring him to the whiffe so soon
yes as soon sir he shall receive the first second and third whiffe if it please him and upon the receipt take his horse drink his three cups of canary and expose one at hounslow a second at stains and a third at bagshot
you will not serve me sir will you
i'll give you more than countenance
pardon me sir i do scorn to serve any man
'sblood he keeps high men and low men he
he has a fair living at fullam
but in the nature of a fellow i'll be your follower if you please
sir you shall stay and dine with me and if we can agree we'll not part in haste i am very bountiful to men of quality
where shall we go signior
your mitre is your best house
i can make this dog take as many whiffes as i list and he shall retain or effume them at my pleasure
by your patience follow me fellows
pardon me my dog shall not eat in his company for a million
nay be not you amazed signior whiffe whatever that stiff necked gentleman says
no for you do not know the humour of the dog as we do where shall we dine carlo
i would fain go to one of these ordinaries now i am a gentleman
so you may were you never at any yet
no faith but they say there resorts your most choice gallants
true and the fashion is when any stranger comes in amongst 'em they all stand up and stare at him as he were some unknown beast brought out of africk but that will be helped with a good adventurous face
you must be impudent enough sit down and use no respect when anything's propounded above your capacity smile at it make two or three faces and 'tis excellent they'll think you have travell'd though you argue a whole day in silence thus and discourse in nothing but laughter 'twill pass
only now and then give fire discharge a good full oath and offer a great wager 'twill be admirable
i warrant you i am resolute come good signior there's a poor french crown for your ordinary
it comes well for i had not so much as the least portcullis of coin before
i travail with another objection signior which i fear will be enforced against the author ere i can be deliver'd of it
that the argument of his comedy might have been of some other nature as of a duke to be in love with a countess and that countess to be in love with the duke's son and the son to love the lady's waiting maid some such cross wooing with a clown to their servingman better than to be thus near and familiarly allied to the time
you say well but i would fain hear one of these autumn judgments define once "quid sit comoedia
" if he cannot let him content himself with cicero's definition till he have strength to propose to himself a better who would have a comedy to be 'imitatio vitae speculum consuetudinis imago veritatis' a thing throughout pleasant and ridiculous and accommodated to the correction of manners if the maker have fail'd in any particle of this they may worthily tax him but if not why be you that are for them silent as i will be for him and give way to the actors
a nay god's precious if the weather and season be so respectless that beggars shall live as well as their betters and that my hunger and thirst for riches shall not make them hunger and thirst with poverty that my sleep shall be broken and their hearts not broken that my coffers shall be full and yet care their's empty and yet merry 'tis time that a cross should bear flesh and blood since flesh and blood cannot bear this cross
what will he hang himself
faith ay it seems his prognostication has not kept touch with him and that makes him despair
beshrew me he will be 'out of his humour' then indeed
tut these star monger knaves who would trust them
one says dark and rainy when 'tis as clear as chrystal another says tempestuous blasts and storms and 'twas as calm as a milk bowl here be sweet rascals for a man to credit his whole fortunes with
you sky staring coxcombs you you fat brains out upon you you are good for nothing but to sweat night caps and make rug gowns dear
you learned men and have not a legion of devils 'a votre service
' by heaven i think i shall die a better scholar than they but soft a a how now sirrah
here's a letter come from your son sir
from my son sir
what would my son sir
some good news no doubt
"sweet and dear father desiring you first to send me your blessing which is more worth to me than gold or silver i desire you likewise to be advertised that this shrove tide contrary to custom we use always to have revels which is indeed dancing and makes an excellent shew in truth especially if we gentlemen be well attired which our seniors note and think the better of our fathers the better we are maintained and that they shall know if they come up and have anything to do in the law therefore good father these are for your own sake as well as mine to re desire you that you let me not want that which is fit for the setting up of our name in the honourable volume of gentility that i may say to our calumniators with tully 'ego sum ortus domus meae tu occasus tuae
' and thus not doubting of your fatherly benevolence i humbly ask your blessing and pray god to bless you
yours if his own" how's this
"yours if his own
" is he not my son except he be his own son
belike this is some new kind of subscription the gallants use
wherefore dost thou stay knave
here's a letter indeed
is this a weather to send benevolence
or is this a season to revel in
'slid the devil and all takes part to vex me i think
this letter would never have come now else now now when the sun shines and the air thus clear
if this hold se shall shortly have an excellent crop of corn spring out of the high ways the streets and houses of the town will be hid with the rankness of the fruits that grow there in spite of good husbandry
go to i'll prevent the sight of it come as quickly as it can i will prevent the sight of it
i have this remedy heaven
a stay i'll try the pain thus a little
shall my son gain a benevolence by my death
or anybody be the better for my gold or so forth
no alive i kept it from them and dead my ghost shall walk about it and preserve it
my son and daughter shall starve ere they touch it i have hid it as deep as hell from the sight of heaven and to it i go now
ah me what pitiful sight is this
o here's a man has hang'd himself help to get him again
'slid carry him afore a justice 'tis chance medley o' my word
how now what's here to do
one has executed himself contrary to order of law and by my consent he shall answer it
would he were in case to answer it
stand by he recovers give him breath
mass 'twas well you went the footway neighbour
ay an i had not cut the halter how
ah me i am undone i am undone
marry if you had not been undone you had been hang'd
i can tell you
you thread bare horse bread eating rascals if you would needs have been meddling could you not have untied it but you must cut it and in the midst too
out on me 'tis the caterpillar sordido
how curst are the poor that the viper was blest with this good fortune
nay how accurst art thou that art cause to the curse of the poor
ay and to save so wretched a caitiff
curst be thy fingers that loos'd him
some desperate fury possess thee that thou may'st hang thyself too
never may'st thou be saved that saved so damn'd a monster
what curses breathe these men
how have my deeds made my looks differ from another man's that they should thus detest and loath my life
out on my wretched humour
it is that makes me thus monstrous in true humane eyes
pardon me gentle friends i'll make fair 'mends for my foul errors past and twenty fold restore to all men what with wrong i robb'd them my barns and garners shall stand open still to all the poor that come and my best grain be made alms bread to feed half famish'd mouths
though hitherto amongst you i have lived like an unsavoury muck hill to myself yet now my gather'd heaps being spread abroad shall turn to better and more fruitful uses
bless then this man curse him no more for the saving my life and soul together
o how deeply the bitter curses of the poor do pierce
i am by wonder changed come in with me and witness my repentance now i prove no life is blest that is not graced with love
see when a man has grace
had it not been pity so good a man should have been cast away
well i'll get our clerk put his conversion in the 'acts and monuments'
do for i warrant him he's a martyr
o god how he wept if you mark'd it
did you see how the tears trill'd
yes believe me like master vicar's bowls upon the green for all the world
o neighbour god's blessing o' your heart neighbour 'twas a good grateful deed
what's that you consider so seriously
troth that which doth essentially please me the warping condition of this green and soggy multitude but in good faith signior your author hath largely outstript my expectation in this scene i will liberally confess it
for when i saw sordido so desperately intended i thought i had had a hand of him then
you supposed he should have hung himself indeed
i did and had framed my objection to it ready which may yet be very fitly urged and with some necessity for though his purposed violence lost the effect and extended not to death yet the intent and horror of the object was more than the nature of a comedy will in any sort admit
what think you of plautus in his comedy called 'cistellaria'
there where he brings in alcesimarchus with a drum sword ready to kill himself and as he is e'en fixing his breast upon it to be restrained from his resolved outrage by silenium and the bawd
is not his authority of power to give our scene approbation
sir i have this only evasion left me to say i think it be so indeed your memory is happier than mine but i wonder what engine he will use to bring the rest out of their humours
that will appear anon never pre occupy your imagination withal
let your mind keep company with the scene still which now removes itself from the country to the court
here comes macilente and signior brisk freshly suited lose not yourself for now the epitasis or busy part of our subject is an act
a well now signior macilente you are not only welcome to the court but also to my mistress's withdrawing chamber boy get me some tobacco
i'll but go in and shew i am here and come to you presently sir
what's that he said
by heaven i mark'd him not my thoughts and i were of another world
i was admiring mine own outside here to think what privilege and palm it bears here in the court
be a man ne'er so vile in wit in judgment manners or what else if he can purchase but a silken cover he shall not only pass but pass regarded whereas let him be poor and meanly clad though ne'er so richly parted you shall have a fellow that knows nothing but his beef or how to rince his clammy guts in beer will take him by the shoulders or the throat and kick him down the stairs
such is the state of virtue in bad clothes
ha ha ha ha
that raiment should be in such high request
how long should i be ere i should put off to the lord chancellor's tomb or the shrives' poste
by heav'n i think a thousand thousand year
his gravity his wisdom and his faith to my dread sovereign graces that survive him these i could well endure to reverence but not his tomb no more than i'd commend the chapel organ for the gilt without or this base viol for the varnish'd face
i fear i have made you stay somewhat long sir but is my tobacco ready boy
give me my mistress is upon coming you shall see her presently sir
you'll say you never accosted a more piercing wit
this tobacco is not dried boy or else the pipe is defective
oh your wits of italy are nothing comparable to her her brain's a very quiver of jests and she does dart them abroad with that sweet loose and judicial aim that you would here she comes sir
'twas time his invention had been bogged else
give me my fan there
how now monsieur brisk
a kind of affectionate reverence strikes me with a cold shivering methinks
i like such tempers well as stand before their mistresses with fear and trembling and before their maker like impudent mountains
by this hand i'd spend twenty pound my vaulting horse stood here now she might see do but one trick
why does she love activity
or if you had but your long stockings on to be dancing a galliard as she comes by
o these stirring humours make ladies mad with desire she comes
my good genius embolden me boy the pipe quickly
will he give her music
a second good morrow to my fair mistress
fair servant i'll thank you a day hence when the date of your salutation comes forth
how like you that answer
i were a simple courtier if i could not admire trifles sir
troth sweet lady i shall be prepared to give you thanks for those thanks and study more officious and obsequious regards to your fair beauties
mend the pipe boy
i never knew tobacco taken as a parenthesis before
'fore god sweet lady believe it i do honour the meanest rush in this chamber for your love
ay you need not tell me that sir i do think you do prize a rush before my love
is this the wonder of nations
o by this air pardon me i said 'for' your love by this light but it is the accustomed sharpness of your ingenuity sweet mistress to mass your viol's new strung methinks
i see his ignorance will not suffer him to slander her which he had done notably if he had said wit for ingenuity as he meant it
by the soul of music lady would we might hear it once
i do more adore and admire your predominant perfections than ever i shall have power and faculty to express upon the viol de gambo you mean
it's miserably out of tune by this hand
nay rather by the fingers
it makes good harmony with her wit
sweet lady tune it
he does court his mistress with very exceeding good changes
signior macilente you take none sir
no unless i had a mistress signior it were a great indecorum for me to take tobacco
how like you her wit
her ingenuity is excellent sir
you see the subject of her sweet fingers there oh she tickles it so that she makes it laugh most divinely i'll tell you a good jest now and yourself shall say it's a good one i have wished myself to be that instrument i think a thousand times and not so few by heaven
not unlike sir but how
to be cased up and hung by on the wall
o no sir to be in use i assure you as your judicious eyes may testify
here servant if you will play come
in good faith here's most divine tobacco
nay i cannot stay to dance after your pipe
nay dear lady stay by this sweet smoke i think your wit be all fire
and he's the salamander belongs to it
is your tobacco perfumed servant that you swear by the sweet smoke
before heaven and these bright lights i think you are made of ingenuity i true as your discourse is
will your ladyship take any
o peace i pray you i love not the breath of a woodcock's head
meaning my head lady
not altogether so sir but as it were fatal to their follies that think to grace themselves with taking tobacco when they want better entertainment you see your pipe bears the true form of a woodcock's head
'tis best leaving of you in admiration sir
are these the admired lady wits that having so good a plain song can run no better division upon it
all her jests are of the stamp march was fifteen years ago
is this the comet monsieur fastidious that your gallants wonder at so
heart of a gentleman to neglect me afore the presence thus
sweet sir i beseech you be silent in my disgrace
by the muses i was never in so vile a humour in my life and her wit was at the flood too
report it not for a million good sir let me be so far endeared to your love
what follows next signior cordatus
this gallant's humour is almost spent methinks it ebbs apace with this contrary breath of his mistress
o but it will flow again for all this till there come a general drought of humour among our actors and then i fear not but his will fall as low as any
see who presents himself here
what in the old case
ay faith which makes it the more pitiful you understand where the scene is
a why are you so melancholy brother
i am not melancholy i thank you sister
why are you not merry then
there are but two of us in all the world and if we should not be comforts one to another god help us
faith i cannot tell sister but if a man had any true melancholy in him it would make him melancholy to see his yeomanly father cut his neighbours' throats to make his son a gentleman and yet when he has cut them he will see his son's throat cut too ere he make him a true gentleman indeed before death cut his own throat
i must be the first head of our house and yet he will not give me the head till i be made so
is any man termed a gentleman that is not always in the fashion
i would know but that
if you be melancholy for that brother i think i have as much cause to be melancholy as any one for i'll be sworn i live as little in the fashion as any woman in london
by the faith of a gentlewoman beast that i am to say it
i have not one friend in the world besides my husband
when saw you master fastidious brisk brother
but a while since sister i think i know not well in truth
by this hand i could fight with all my heart methinks
nay good brother be not resolute
i sent him a letter and he writes me no answer neither
oh sweet fastidious brisk
thou are he makest me sigh and say how blessed is that woman that hath a courtier to her husband and how miserable a dame she is that hath neither husband nor friend in the court
how comely he bows him in his court'sy
how full he hits a woman between the lips when he kisses
how upright he sits at the table
how daintily he carves
how sweetly he talks and tells news of this lord and of that lady
how cleanly he wipes his spoon at every spoonful of any whitemeat he eats
and what a neat case of pick tooths he carries about him still
a see yonder she is gentlemen
now as ever you'll bear the name of musicians touch your instruments sweetly she has a delicate ear i tell you play not a false note i beseech you
fear not signior deliro
o begin begin some sprightly thing lord how my imagination labours with the success of it
a well said good i'faith
heaven grant it please her
i'll not be seen for then she'll be sure to dislike it
i'll lay my life this is my husband's dotage
i thought so nay never play bo peep with me i know you do nothing but study how to anger me sir
anger thee sweet wife
why didst thou not send for musicians at supper last night thyself
now come up to supper i beseech you as though there were no difference between supper time when folks should be merry and this time when they should be melancholy
i would never take upon me to take a wife if i had no more judgment to please her
be pleased sweet wife and they shall have done and would to fate my life were done if i can never please thee
save you lady where is master deliro
here master macilente you are welcome from court sir no doubt you have been graced exceedingly of master brisk's mistress and the rest of the ladies for his sake
alas the poor fantastic
he's scarce known to any lady there and those that know him know him the simplest man of all they know deride and play upon his amorous humours though he but apishly doth imitate the gallant'st courtiers kissing ladies' pumps holding the cloth for them praising their wits and servilely observing every one may do them pleasure fearful to be seen with any man though he be ne'er so worthy that's not in grace with some that are the greatest
thus courtiers do and these he counterfeits but sets no such a sightly carriage upon their vanities as they themselves and therefore they despise him for indeed he's like the zany to a tumbler that tries tricks after him to make men laugh
here's an unthankful spiteful wretch
the good gentleman vouchsafed to make him his companion because my husband put him into a few rags and now see how the unrude rascal backbites him
is he no more graced amongst them then say you
faith like a pawn at chess fills up a room that's all
o monster of men
can the earth bear such an envious caitiff
well i repent me i ever credited him so much but now i see what he is and that his masking vizor is off i'll forbear him no longer
all his lands are mortgaged to me and forfeited besides i have bonds of his in my hand for the receipt of now fifty pounds now a hundred now two hundred still as he has had a fan but wagged at him he would be in a new suit
well i'll salute him by a serjeant the next time i see him i'faith i'll suit him
why you may soon see him sir for he is to meet signior puntarvolo at a notary's by the exchange presently where he meant to take up upon return
now out upon thee judas
canst thou not be content to backbite thy friend but thou must betray him
wilt thou seek the undoing of any man
and of such a man too
and will you sir get your living by the counsel of traitors
dear wife have patience
the house will fall the ground will open and swallow us i'll not bide here for all the gold and silver in heaven
o good macilente let's follow and appease her or the peace of my life is at an end
now pease and not peace feed that life whose head hangs so heavily over a woman's manger
ods body an you come here i'll do myself a mischief
nay hear me sweet wife unless thou wilt have me go i will not go
tut you shall never have that vantage of me to say you are undone by me
i'll not bid you stay brother sweet brother here's four angels i'll give you towards your suit for the love of gentry and as ever you came of christian creature make haste to the water side you know where master fastidious uses to land and give him warning of my husband's malicious intent and tell him of that lean rascal's treachery
o heavens how my flesh rises at him
nay sweet brother make haste you may say i would have writ to him but that the necessity of the time would not permit
he cannot choose but take it extraordinarily from me and commend me to him good brother say i sent you
let me see these four angels and then forty shillings more i can borrow on my gown in fetter lane
well i will go presently say on my suit pay as much money as i have and swear myself into credit with my tailor for the rest
o on my soul you wrong her macilente
though she be froward yet i know she is honest
well then have i no judgment
would any woman but one that were wild in her affections have broke out into that immodest and violent passion against her husband
or is't possible if you love me forbear all the arguments i' the world shall never wrest my heart to believe it
how like you the deciphering of his dotage
o strangely an of the other's envy too that labours so seriously to set debate betwixt a man and his wife
stay here comes the knight adventurer
ay and his scrivener with him
i wonder monsieur fastidious comes not
but notary if thou please to draw the indentures the while i will give thee thy instructions
with all my heart sir and i'll fall in hand with them presently
well then first the sum is to be understood
next our several appellations and character of my dog and cat must be known
shew him the cat sirrah
then that the intended bound is the turk's court in constantinople the time limited for our return a year and that if either of us miscarry the whole venture is lost
these are general conceiv'st thou
or if either of us turn turk
now for particulars that i may make my travels by sea or land to my best liking and that hiring a coach for myself it shall be lawful for my dog or cat or both to ride with me in the said coach
that i may choose to give my dog or cat fish for fear of bones or any other nutriment that by the judgment of the most authentical physicians where i travel shall be thought dangerous
that after the receipt of his money he shall neither in his own person nor any other either by direct or indirect means as magic witchcraft or other such exotic arts attempt practise or complot any thing to the prejudice of me my dog or my cat neither shall i use the help of any such sorceries or enchantments as unctions to make our skins impenetrable or to travel invisible by virtue of a powder or a ring or to hang any three forked charm about my dog's neck secretly conveyed into his collar understand you
but that all be performed sincerely without fraud or imposture
that for testimony of the performance myself am to bring thence a turk's mustachio my dog a grecian hare's lips and my cat the train or tail of a thracian rat
'tis said sir not done sir
but forward that upon my return and landing on the tower wharf with the aforesaid testimony i am to receive five for one according to the proportion of the sums put forth
provided that if before our departure or setting forth either myself or these be visited with sickness or any other casual event so that the whole course of the adventure be hindered thereby that then he is to return and i am to receive the prenominated proportion upon fair and equal terms
very good sir is this all
it is all sir and dispatch them good notary
as fast as is possible sir
welcome saw you monsieur brisk
not i did he appoint you to meet here
ay and i muse he should be so tardy he is to take an hundred pounds of me in venture if he maintain his promise
is his hour past
not yet but it comes on apace
tut be not jealous of him he will sooner break all the commandments than his hour upon my life in such a case trust him
methinks carlo you look very smooth ha
why i came but now from a hot house i must needs look smooth
from a hot house
ay do you make a wonder on't
why it is your only physic
let a man sweat once a week in a hot house and be well rubb'd and froted with a good plump juicy wench and sweet linen he shall ne'er have the pox
what the french pox
out pox we have them in as good a form as they man what
let me perish but thou art a salt one
was your new created gallant there with you sogliardo
hang him no he's a leiger at horn's ordinary yonder his villainous ganymede and he have been droning a tobacco pipe there ever since yesterday noon
signior tripartite that would give my dog the whiffe
they have hired a chamber and all private to practise in for the making of the patoun the receipt reciprocal and a number of other mysteries not yet extant
i brought some dozen or twenty gallants this morning to view them as you'd do a piece of perspective in at a key hole and there we might see sogliardo sit in a chair holding his snout up like a sow under an apple tree while the other open'd his nostrils with a poking stick to give the smoke a more free delivery
they had spit some three or fourscore ounces between 'em afore we came away
spit three or fourscore ounces
ay and preserv'd it in porrengers as a barber does his blood when he opens a vein
how dost thou open the vein of thy friend
is there any such foolish thing in the world ha
'slid i never relished it yet
thy humour is the more dangerous
no not a whit signior
tut a man must keep time in all i can oil my tongue when i meet him next and look with a good sleek forehead 'twill take away all soil of suspicion and that's enough what lynceus can see my heart
pish the title of a friend
it's a vain idle thing only venerable among fools you shall not have one that has any opinion of wit affect it
save you good sir puntarvolo
pray you sir did you see master fastidious brisk
i heard he was to meet your worship here
you heard no figment sir i do expect him at every pulse of my watch
in good time sir
there's a fellow now looks like one of the patricians of sparta marry his wit's after ten i' the hundred a good bloodhound a close mouthed dog he follows the scent well marry he's at fault now methinks
i should wonder at that creature is free from the danger of thy tongue
o i cannot abide these limbs of satin or rather satan indeed that will walk like the children of darkness all day in a melancholy shop with their pockets full of blanks ready to swallow up as many poor unthrifts as come within the verge
and what hast thou for him that is with him now
o d n me
i'll not meddle with him the pure element of fire all spirit extraction
ha what is he man
a scholar macilente do you not know him
a rank raw boned anatomy he walks up and down like a charged musket no man dares encounter him that's his rest there
why has he a forked head
pardon me that's to be suspended you are too quick too apprehensive
troth now i think on't i'll defer it till some other time
not by any means signior you shall not lose this opportunity he will be here presently now
yes faith macilente 'tis best
for look you sir i shall so exceedingly offend my wife in't that your wife
now for shame lose these thoughts and become the master of your own spirits
should i if i had a wife suffer myself to be thus passionately carried to and fro with the stream of her humour and neglect my deepest affairs to serve her affections
'slight i would geld myself first
o but signior had you such a wife as mine is you would such a wife
now hate me sir if ever i discern'd any wonder in your wife yet with all the speculation i have i have seen some that have been thought fairer than she in my time and i have seen those have not been altogether so tall esteem'd properer women and i have seen less noses grow upon sweeter faces that have done very well too in my judgment
but in good faith signior for all this the gentlewoman is a good pretty proud hard favour'd thing marry not so peerlessly to be doted upon i must confess nay be not angry
well sir however you please to forget yourself i have not deserv'd to be thus played upon but henceforth pray you forbear my house for i can but faintly endure the savour of his breath at my table that shall thus jade me for my courtesies
nay then signior let me tell you your wife is no proper woman and by my life i suspect her honesty that's more which you may likewise suspect if you please do you see
i'll urge you to nothing against your appetite but if you please you may suspect it
now horn upon horn pursue thee thou blind egregious dotard
o you shall hear him speak like envy
signior macilente you saw monsieur brisk lately i heard you were with him at court
ay buffone i was with him
and how is he respected there
i know you'll deal ingenuously with us is he made much of amongst the sweeter sort of gallants
faith ay his civet and his casting glass have helpt him to a place amongst the rest and there his seniors give him good slight looks after their garb smile and salute in french with some new compliment
what is this all
why say that they should shew the frothy fool such grace as they pretend comes from the heart he had a mighty windfall out of doubt
why all their graces are not to do grace to virtue or desert but to ride both with their gilt spurs quite breathless from themselves
'tis now esteem'd precisianism in wit and a disease in nature to be kind toward desert to love or seek good names
who feeds with a good name
who thrives with loving
who can provide feast for his own desires with serving others
'tis folly by our wisest worldlings proved if not to gain by love to be beloved
how like you him
is't not a good spiteful slave ha
i could eat his flesh now divine sweet villain
nay prithee leave what's he there
this in the starched beard
it's the dull stiff knight puntarvolo man he's to travel now presently he has a good knotty wit marry he carries little on't out of the land with him
he puts it forth in venture as he does his money upon the return of a dog and cat
ay this is he a good tough gentleman he looks like a shield of brawn at shrove tide out of date and ready to take his leave or a dry pole of ling upon easter eve that has furnish'd the table all lent as he has done the city this last vacation
come you'll never leave your stabbing similes i shall have you aiming at me with 'em by and by but o renounce me then
pure honest good devil i love thee above the love of women i could e'en melt in admiration of thee now
ods so look here man sir dagonet and his squire
save you my dear gallantos nay come approach good cavalier prithee sweet knight know this gentleman he's one that it pleases me to use as my good friend and companion and therefore do him good offices i beseech you gentles know him i know him all over
sir for signior sogliardo's sake let it suffice i know you
why as i am a gentleman i thank you knight and it shall suffice
hark you sir puntarvolo you'd little think it he's as resolute a piece of flesh as any in the world
upon my gentility sir carlo a word with you do you see that same fellow there
o you know him cry you mercy before me i think him the tallest man living within the walls of europe
the walls of europe
take heed what you say signior europe's a huge thing within the walls
'tut an 'twere as huge again i'd justify what i speak
'slid he swagger'd even now in a place where we were i never saw a man do it more resolute
nay indeed swaggering is a good argument of resolution
do you hear this signior
ay to my grief
o that such muddy flags for every drunken flourish should achieve the name of manhood whilst true perfect valour hating to shew itself goes by despised
i do know now in a fair just cause i dare do more than he a thousand times why should not they take knowledge of this ha
and give my worth allowance before his
because i cannot swagger
now the pox light on your pickt hatch prowess
why i tell you sir he has been the only 'bid stand' that ever kept new market salisbury plain hockley i' the hole gadshill and all the high places of any request he has had his mares and his geldings he have been worth forty threescore a hundred pound a horse would ha' sprung you over the hedge and ditch like your greyhound he has done five hundred robberies in his time more or less i assure you
i'faith ay he has broken the gaol when he has been in irons and irons and been out and in again and out and in forty times and not so few he
a fit trumpet to proclaim such a person
but can this be possible
pardon me my dear orestes causes have their quiddits and 'tis ill jesting with bell ropes
ay he is my pylades and i am his orestes how like you the conceit
o 'tis an old stale interlude device no i'll give you names myself look you he shall be your judas and you shall be his elder tree to hang on
nay rather let him be captain pod and this his motion for he does nothing but shew him
excellent or thus you shall be holden and he your camel
you do not mean to ride gentlemen
faith let me end it for you gallants you shall be his countenance and he your resolution
troth that's pretty how say you cavalier shall it be so
ay ay most voices
faith i am easily yielding to any good impressions
then give hands good resolution
mass he cannot say good countenance now properly to him again
yes by an irony
o sir the countenance of resolution should as he is be altogether grim and unpleasant
good hours make music with your mirth gentlemen and keep time to your humours
many a long look have i extended for you sir
good faith i must crave pardon i was invited this morning ere i was out of my bed by a bevy of ladies to a banquet whence it was almost one of hercules's labours for me to come away but that the respect of my promise did so prevail with me
i know they'll take it very ill especially one that gave me this bracelet of her hair but over night and this pearl another gave me from her forehead marry she what
are the writings ready
i will send my man to know
sirrah go you to the notary's and learn if he be ready leave the dog sir
and how does my rare qualified friend sogliardo
by these eyes i saw you not i had saluted you sooner else o' my troth
i hope sir i may presume upon you that you will not divulge my late check or disgrace indeed sir
he knows some notorious jest by this gull that he hath him so obsequious
monsieur fastidious do you see this fellow there
does he not look like a clown
would you think there were any thing in him
any thing in him
beshrew me ay the fellow hath a good ingenious face
by this element he is as ingenious a tall man as ever swagger'd about london he and i call countenance and resolution but his name is cavalier shift
cavalier you knew signior clog that was hang'd for the robbery at harrow on the hill
why 'twas he gave all the directions for the action
was it your project sir
pardon me countenance you do me some wrong to make occasions public which i imparted to you in private
here are none but friends resolution
that's all one things of consequence must have their respects where how and to whom
yes sir he shewed himself a true clog in the coherence of that affair sir for if he had managed matters as they were corroborated to him it had been better for him by a forty or fifty score of pounds sir and he himself might have lived in despight of fates to have fed on woodcocks with the rest but it was his heavy fortune to sink poor clog
and therefore talk no more of him
why had he more aiders then
ay there were some present there that were the nine worthies to him i'faith
ay sir i can satisfy you at more convenient conference but for mine own part i have now reconciled myself to other courses and profess a living out of my other qualities
nay he has left all now i assure you and is able to live like a gentleman by his qualities
by this dog he has the most rare gift in tobacco that ever you knew
he keeps more ado with this monster than ever banks did with his horse or the fellow with the elephant
he will hang out his picture shortly in a cloth you shall see
o he does manage a quarrel the best that ever you saw for terms and circumstances
good faith signior now you speak of a quarrel i'll acquaint you with a difference that happened between a gallant and myself sir puntarvolo you know him if i should name him signior luculento
what inauspicious chance interposed itself to your two loves
faith sir the same that sundered agamemnon and great thetis' son but let the cause escape sir he sent me a challenge mixt with some few braves which i restored and in fine we met
now indeed sir i must tell you he did offer at first very desperately but without judgment for look you sir i cast myself into this figure now he comes violently on and withal advancing his rapier to strike i thought to have took his arm for he had left his whole body to my election and i was sure he could not recover his guard
sir i mist my purpose in his arm rash'd his doublet sleeve ran him close by the left cheek and through his hair
he again lights me here i had on a gold cable hatband then new come up which i wore about a murey french hat i had cuts my hatband and yet it was massy goldsmith's work cuts my brims which by good fortune being thick embroidered with gold twist and spangles disappointed the force of the blow nevertheless it grazed on my shoulder takes me away six purls of an italian cut work band i wore cost me three pound in the exchange but three days before
this was a strange encounter
nay you shall hear sir with this we both fell out and breath'd
now upon the second sign of his assault i betook me to the former manner of my defence he on the other side abandon'd his body to the same danger as before and follows me still with blows but i being loth to take the deadly advantage that lay before me of his left side made a kind of stramazoun ran him up to the hilts through the doublet through the shirt and yet miss'd the skin
he making a reverse blow falls upon my emboss'd girdle i had thrown off the hangers a little before strikes off a skirt of a thick laced satin doublet i had lined with four taffatas cuts off two panes embroidered with pearl rends through the drawings out of tissue enters the linings and skips the flesh
i wonder he speaks not of his wrought shirt
here in the opinion of mutual damage we paused but ere i proceed i must tell you signior that in this last encounter not having leisure to put off my silver spurs one of the rowels catch'd hold of the ruffle of my boot and being spanish leather and subject to tear overthrows me rends me two pair of silk stockings that i put on being somewhat a raw morning a peach colour and another and strikes me some half inch deep into the side of the calf he seeing the blood come presently takes horse and away i having bound up my wound with a piece of my wrought shirt comes it in there
rid after him and lighting at the court gate both together embraced and march'dhand in hand up into the presence
was not this business well carried
yes and by this we can guess what apparel the gentleman wore
'fore valour it was a designment begun with much resolution maintain'd with as much prowess and ended with more humanity
how now what says the notary
he says he is ready sir he stays but your worship's pleasure
come we will go to him monsieur
gentlemen shall we entreat you to be witnesses
you shall entreat me sir
i follow you good countenance
come signior come come
o that there should be fortune to clothe these men so naked in desert
and that the just storm of a wretched life beats them not ragged for their wretched souls and since as fruitless even as black as coals
why but signior how comes it that fungoso appeared not with his sister's intelligence to brisk
marry long of the evil angels that she gave him who have indeed tempted the good simple youth to follow the tail of the fashion and neglect the imposition of his friends
behold here he comes very worshipfully attended and with good variety
a a gramercy good shoemaker i'll put to strings myself
now sir let me see what must you have for this hat
here's the bill sir
how does it become me well
excellent sir as ever you had any hat in your life
nay you'll say so all
in faith sir the hat's as good as any man in this town can serve you and will maintain fashion as long never trust me for a groat else
does it apply well to my suit
how lik'st thou my suit haberdasher
by my troth sir 'tis very rarely well made i never saw a suit sit better i can tell on
nay we have no art to please our friends we
here haberdasher tell this same
good faith sir it makes you have an excellent body
nay believe me i think i have as good a body in clothes as another
you lack points to bring your apparel together sir
i'll have points anon
faith sir 'tis too little' but upon farther hopes good morrow to you sir
well now master snip let me see your bill
me thinks he discharges his followers too thick
o therein he saucily imitates some great man
i warrant you though he turns off them he keeps this tailor in place of a page to follow him still
this bill is very reasonable in faith hark you master snip troth sir i am not altogether so well furnished at this present as i could wish i were but if you'll do me the favour to take part in hand you shall have all i have by this hand
sir and but give me credit for the rest till the beginning of the next term
o lord sir 'fore god and by this light i'll pay you to the utmost and acknowledge myself very deeply engaged to you by the courtesy
why how much have you there sir
marry i have here four angels and fifteen shillings of white money it's all i have as i hope to be blest you will not fail me at the next term with the rest
no an i do pray heaven i be hang'd
let me never breathe again upon this mortal stage as the philosopher calls it
by this air and as i am a gentleman i'll hold
he were an iron hearted fellow in my judgment that would not credit him upon this volley of oaths
well sir i'll not stick with any gentleman for a trifle you know what 'tis remains
ay sir and i give you thanks in good faith
o fate how happy i am made in this good fortune
well now i'll go seek out monsieur brisk
'ods so i have forgot riband for my shoes and points
'slid what luck's this
how shall i do
master snip pray let me reduct some two or three shillings for points and ribands as i am an honest man i have utterly disfurnished myself in the default of memory pray let me be beholding to you it shall come home in the bill believe me
faith sir i can hardly depart with ready money but i'll take up and send you some by my boy presently
what coloured riband would you have
what you shall think meet in your judgment sir to my suit
well i'll send you some presently
and points too sir
and points too sir
good lord how shall i study to deserve this kindness of you sir
pray let your youth make haste for i should have done a business an hour since that i doubt i shall come too late
now in good faith i am exceeding proud of my suit
do you observe the plunges that this poor gallant is put to signior to purchase the fashion
ay and to be still a fashion behind with the world that's the sport
stay o here they come from seal'd and deliver'd
a well now my whole venture is forth i will resolve to depart shortly
faith sir puntarvolo go to the court and take leave of the ladies first
i care not if it be this afternoon's labour
faith gallants i am persuading this gentleman to turn courtier
he is a man of fair revenue and his estate will bear the charge well
besides for his other gifts of the mind or so why they are as nature lent him them pure simple without any artificial drug or mixture of these two threadbare beggarly qualities learning and knowledge and therefore the more accommodate and genuine
now for the life itself o the most celestial and full of wonder and delight that can be imagined signior beyond thought and apprehension of pleasure
a man lives there in that divine rapture that he will think himself i' the ninth heaven for the time and lose all sense of mortality whatsoever when he shall behold such glorious and almost immortal beauties hear such angelical and harmonious voices discourse with such flowing and ambrosial spirits whose wits are as sudden as lightning and humorous as nectar oh it makes a man all quintessence and flame and lifts him up in a moment to the very crystal crown of the sky where hovering in the strength of his imagination he shall behold all the delights of the hesperides the insulae fortunatae adonis' gardens tempe or what else confined within the amplest verge of poesy to be mere umbrae and imperfect figures conferred with the most essential felicity of your court
well this ecomium was not extemporal it came too perfectly off
besides sir you shall never need to go to a hot house you shall sweat there with courting your mistress or losing your money at primero as well as in all the stoves in sweden
marry this sir you must ever be sure to carry a good strong perfume about you that your mistress's dog may smell you out amongst the rest and in making love to her never fear to be out for you may have a pipe of tobacco or a bass viol shall hang o' the wall of purpose will put you in presently
the tricks your resolution has taught you in tobacco the whiffe and those sleights will stand you in very good ornament there
ay to some perhaps but an he should come to my mistress with tobacco this gentleman knows she'd reply upon him i'faith
o by this bright sun she has the most acute ready and facetious wit that tut there's no spirit able to stand her
you can report it signior you have seen her
then can he report no less out of his judgment i assure him
troth i like her well enough but she's too self conceited methinks
ay indeed she's a little too self conceited an 'twere not for that humour she were the most to be admired lady in the world
indeed it is a humour that takes from her other excellences
why it may easily be made to forsake her in my thought
then are all impossibilities easy
you conclude too quick upon me signior
what will you say if i make it so perspicuously appear now that yourself shall confess nothing more possible
marry i will say i will both applaud and admire you for it
and i will second him in the admiration
why i'll show you gentlemen
good faith i have a great humour to the court
what thinks my resolution
troth countenance as you please the place is a place of good reputation and capacity
o my tricks in tobacco as carlo says will show excellent there
why you may go with these gentlemen now and see fashions and after as you shall see correspondence
you will go with me resolution
i will meet you countenance about three or four o'clock but to say to go with you i cannot for as i am apple john i am to go before the cockatrice you saw this morning and therefore pray present me excused good countenance
farewell good resolution but fail not to meet
if you can but persuade sogliardo to court there's all now
o let me alone that's my task
now by wit macilente it's above measure excellent 'twill be the only court exploit that ever proved courtier ingenious
upon my soul it puts the lady quite out of her humour and we shall laugh with judgment
come the gentleman was of himself resolved to go with you afore i moved it
why then gallants you two and carlo go afore to prepare the jest sogliardo and i will come some while after you
pardon me i am not for the court
that's true carlo comes not at court indeed
well you shall leave it to the faculty of monsieur brisk and myself upon our lives we will manage it happily
carlo shall bespeak supper at the mitre against we come back where we will meet and dimple our cheeks with laughter at the success
ay but will you promise to come
myself shall undertake for them he that fails let his reputation lie under the lash of thy tongue
ods so look who comes here
uncle god save you did you see a gentleman one monsieur brisk a courtier
he goes in such a suit as i do
here is the gentleman nephew but not in such a suit
would you speak with me sir
ay when he has recovered himself poor poll
i am not well sir
why this it is to dog the fashion
nay come gentlemen remember your affairs his disease is nothing but the flux of apparel
sirs return to the lodging keep the cat safe i'll be the dog's guardian myself
nephew will you go to court with us
these gentlemen and i are for the court nay be not so melancholy
'slid i think no man in christendom has that rascally fortune that i have
faith you suit is well enough signior
nay not for that i protest but i had an errand to monsieur fastidious and i have forgot it
why go along to court with us and remember it come gentlemen you three take one boat and sogliardo and i will take another we shall be there instantly
content good sir vouchsafe us your pleasance
i warrant you would i had one of kemp's shoes to throw after you
good fortune will close the eyes of our jest fear not and we shall frolick
this macilente signior begins to be more sociable on a sudden methinks than he was before there's some portent in it i believe
o he's a fellow of a strange nature
now does he in this calm of his humour plot and store up a world of malicious thoughts in his brain till he is so full with them that you shall see the very torrent of his envy break forth like a land flood and against the course of all their affections oppose itself so violently that you will almost have wonder to think how 'tis possible the current of their dispositions shall receive so quick and strong an alteration
ay marry sir this is that on which my expectation has dwelt all this while for i must tell you signior though i was loth to interrupt the scene yet i made it a question in mine own private discourse how he should properly call it "every man out of his humour" when i saw all his actors so strongly pursue and continue their humours
why therein his art appears most full of lustre and approacheth nearest the life especially when in the flame and height of their humours they are laid flat it fills the eye better and with more contentment
how tedious a sight were it to behold a proud exalted tree kept and cut down by degrees when it might be fell'd in a moment
and to set the axe to it before it came to that pride and fulness were as not to have it grow
well i shall long till i see this fall you talk of
to help your longing signior let your imagination be swifter than a pair of oars and by this suppose puntarvolo brisk fungoso and the dog arrived at the court gate and going up to the great chamber
macilente and sogliardo we'll leave them on the water till possibility and natural means may land them
here come the gallants now prepare your expectations
v come gentles signior you are sufficiently instructed
but stay i take thought how to bestow my dog he is no competent attendant for the presence
mass that's true indeed knight you must not carry him into the presence
i know it and i like a dull beast forgot to bring one of my cormorants to attend me
why you were best leave him at the porter's lodge
not so his worth is too well known amongst them to be forth coming
'slight how will you do then
i must leave him with one that is ignorant of his quality if i will have him to be safe
here comes one that will carry coals ergo will hold my dog
a a my honest friend may i commit the tuition of this dog to thy prudent care
you may if you please sir
pray thee let me find thee here at my return it shall not be long till i will ease thee of thy employment and please thee
why but will you leave him with so slight command and infuse no more charge upon the fellow
no there were no policy in that that were to let him know the value of the gem he holds and so to tempt frail nature against her disposition
no pray thee let thy honesty be sweet as it shall be short
but hark you gallants and chiefly monsieur brisk when we come in eye shot or presence of this lady let not other matters carry us from our project but if we can single her forth to some place i warrant you
and be not too sudden but let the device induce itself with good circumstance
is this the way
good truth here be fine hangings
marry it shall sir doubt you not for even at this instant if one would give me twenty pounds i would not deliver him there's for the sweet but now if any man come offer me but two pence he shall have him there's for the short now
'slid what a mad humorous gentleman is this to leave his dog with me
i could run away with him now an he were worth any thing
come on signior now prepare to court this all witted lady most naturally and like yourself
faith an you say the word i'll begin to her in tobacco
no you shall begin with "how does my sweet lady" or "why are you so melancholy madam
" though she be very merry it's all one
be sure to kiss your hand often enough pray for her health and tell her how "more than most fair she is"
screw your face at one side thus and protest let her fleer and look askance and hide her teeth with her fan when she laughs a fit to bring her into more matter that's nothing you must talk forward though it be without sense so it be without blushing 'tis most court like and well
but shall i not use tobacco at all
o by no means 'twill but make your breath suspected and that you use it only to confound the rankness of that
nay i'll be advised sir by my friends
od's my life see where sir puntarvolo's dog is
i would the gentleman would return for his follower here i'll leave him to his fortunes else
'twere the only true jest in the world to poison him now ha
by this hand i'll do it if i could but get him of the fellow
signior sogliardo walk aside and think upon some device to entertain the lady with
so i do sir
a how now mine honest friend
whose dog keeper art thou
i hope i scorn that i'faith
why dost thou not keep a dog
sir now i do and now i do not i think this be sweet and short
make me his dog keeper
this is excellent above expectation
nay stay sir you'd be travelling but i'll give you a dram shall shorten your voyage here
so sir i'll be bold to take my leave of you
now to the turk's court in the devil's name for you shall never go o' god's name
i have it i'faith now will sting it
take heed you leese it not signior ere you come there preserve it
how like you this first exploit of his
o a piece of true envy but i expect the issue of the other device
here they come will make it appear
why i thought sir puntarvolo you had been gone your voyage
dear and most amiable lady your divine beauties do bind me to those offices that i cannot depart when i would
'tis most court like spoken sir but how might we do to have a sight of your dog and cat
his dog is in the court lady
and not your cat
how dare you trust her behind you sir
troth madam she hath sore eyes and she doth keep her chamber marry i have left her under sufficient guard there are two of my followers to attend her
i'll give you some water for her eyes
when do you go sir
certes sweet lady i know not
he doth stay the rather madam to present your acute judgment with so courtly and well parted a gentleman as yet your ladyship hath never seen
what is he gentle monsieur brisk
no lady this is a kinsman to justice silence
pray sir give me leave to report him
he's a gentleman lady of that rare and admirable faculty as i protest i know not his like in europe he is exceedingly valiant an excellent scholar and so exactly travelled that he is able in discourse to deliver you a model of any prince's court in the world speaks the languages with that purity of phrase and facility of accent that it breeds astonishment his wit the most exuberant and above wonder pleasant of all that ever entered the concave of this ear
'tis most true lady marry he is no such excellent proper man
his travels have changed his complexion madam
o sir puntarvolo you must think every man was not born to have my servant brisk's feature
but that which transcends all lady he doth so peerlessly imitate any manner of person for gesture action passion or whatever ay especially a rustic or a clown madam that it is not possible for the sharpest sighted wit in the world to discern any sparks of the gentleman in him when he does it
o monsieur brisk be not so tyrannous to confine all wits within the compass of your own not find the sparks of a gentleman in him if he be a gentleman
no in truth sweet lady i believe you cannot
do you believe so
why i can find sparks of a gentleman in you sir
ay he is a gentleman madam and a reveller
indeed i think i have seen your ladyship at our revels
like enough sir but would i might see this wonder you talk of may one have a sight of him for any reasonable sum
yes madam he will arrive presently
what and shall we see him clown it
i'faith sweet lady that you shall see here he comes
pray observe him lady
beshrew me he clowns it properly indeed
nay mark his courtship
how does my sweet lady
beautiful an it please you sir but not lusty
o ho lady it pleases you to say so in truth and how does my sweet lady
'bonaroba quaeso que novelles
why gallants is this he that cannot be deciphered
they were very blear witted i'faith that could not discern the gentleman in him
but you do in earnest lady
why if you had any true court judgment in the carriage of his eye and that inward power that forms his countenance you might perceive his counterfeiting as clear as the noon day alas nay if you would have tried my wit indeed you should never have told me he was a gentleman but presented him for a true clown indeed and then have seen if i could have deciphered him
'fore god her ladyship says true knight but does he not affect the clown most naturally mistress
o she cannot but affirm that out of the bounty of her judgment
nay out of doubt he does well for a gentleman to imitate but i warrant you he becomes his natural carriage of the gentleman much better than his clownery
'tis strange in truth her ladyship should see so far into him
ay is it not
faith as easily as may be not decipher him quoth you
good sadness i wonder at it why has she deciphered him gentlemen
o most miraculously and beyond admiration
she hath gather'd most infallible signs of the gentleman in him that's certain
why gallants let me laugh at you a little was this your device to try my judgment in a gentleman
nay lady do not scorn us though you have this gift of perspicacy above others
what if he should be no gentleman now but a clown indeed lady
how think you of that
would not your ladyship be out of your humour
o but she knows it is not so
what if he were not a man ye may as well say
nay if your worships could gull me so indeed you were wiser than you are taken for
in good faith lady he is a very perfect clown both by father and mother that i'll assure you
o sir you are very pleasurable
nay do but look on his hand and that shall resolve you look you lady what a palm here is
tut that was with holding the plough
did you discern any such thing in him madam
faith no she saw the gentleman as bright as noon day she she deciphered him at first
troth i am sorry your ladyship's sight should be so suddenly struck
o you are goodly beagles
what is she gone
nay stay sweet lady 'que novelles
' out you fool you
she's out of her humour i'faith
nay let's follow it while 'tis hot gentlemen
come on mine honour we shall make her blush in the presence my spleen is great with laughter
your laughter will be a child of a feeble life i believe sir
come signior your looks are too dejected methinks why mix you not mirth with the rest
od's will this suit frets me at the soul
i'll have it alter'd to morrow sure
i am come to the court to meet with my countenance sogliardo poor men must be glad of such countenance when they can get no better
well need may insult upon a man but it shall never make him despair of consequence
the world will say 'tis base tush base
'tis base to live under the earth not base to live above it by any means
the poor lady is most miserably out of her humour i'faith
there was never so witty a jest broken at the tilt of all the court wits christen'd
o this applause taints it foully
i think i did my part in courting
ay me my dog
'sprecious go seek for the fellow good signior here here i left him
why none was here when we came in now but cavalier shirt enquire of him
did you see sir puntarvolo's dog here cavalier since you came
he may look his dog sir i saw none of his dog sir
upon my life he has stolen your dog sir and been hired to it by some that have ventured with you you may guess by his peremptory answers
not unlike for he hath been a notorious thief by his own confession
sirrah where is my dog
charge me with your dog sir
i have none of your dog sir
s'blood you are but a man sir
rogue and thief restore him
take heed sir puntarvolo what you do he'll bear no coals i can tell you o' my word
it's marle he stabs you not by this light he hath stabbed forty for forty times less matter i can tell you of my knowledge
i will make thee stoop thou abject
make him stoop sir
gentlemen pacify him or he'll be kill'd
is he so tall a man
if you love his life stand betwixt them
my dog villain or i will hang thee thou hast confest robberies and other felonious acts to this gentleman thy countenance i'll bear no witness
and without my dog i will hang thee for them
kneel to thine enemies
pardon me good sir god is my witness i never did robbery in all my life
o sir puntarvolo your dog lies giving up the ghost in the wood yard
heart is he not dead yet
o my dog born to disastrous fortune
pray you conduct me sir
did you never do any robbery in your life
o this is good
so he swore sir
ay i heard him and did you swear true sir
ay as i hope to be forgiven sir i never robbed any man i never stood by the highwayside sir but only said so because i would get myself a name and be counted a tall man
now out base viliaco
by this light gentlemen he hath confest to me the most inexorable company of robberies and damn'd himself that he did 'em you never heard the like
follow me no more i command thee out of my sight go hence speak not i will not hear thee away camouccio
o how i do feed upon this now and fat myself
here were a couple unexpectedly dishumour'd
well by this time i hope sir puntarvolo and his dog are both out of humour to travel
nay gentlemen why do you not seek out the knight and comfort him
our supper at the mitre must of necessity hold to night if you love your reputations
'fore god i am so melancholy for his dog's disaster but i'll go
faith and i may go too but i know i shall be so melancholy
you must forget that now and remember you lie at the mercy of a fury carlo will rack your sinews asunder and rail you to dust if you come not
o then their fear of carlo belike makes them hold their meeting
ay here he comes conceive him but to be enter'd the mitre and 'tis enough
where be these shot sharks

and withal hear you draw me the biggest shaft you have out of the butt you wot of away you know my meaning george quick
i never hungered so much for anything in my life as i do to know our gallants' success at court now is that lean bald rib macilente that salt villain plotting some mischievous device and lies a soaking in their frothy humours like a dry crust till he has drunk 'em all up could the pummice but hold up his eyes at other men's happiness in any reasonable proportion 'slid the slave were to be loved next heaven above honour wealth rich fare apparel wenches all the delights of the belly and the groin whatever
is it right boy
ay sir i assure you 'tis right
well said my dear george depart come my small gimblet you in the false scabbard away so
now to you sir burgomaster let's taste of your bounty
what will he deal upon such quantities of wine alone
you will perceive that sir
ay marry sir here's purity o george i could bite off his nose for this now sweet rogue he has drawn nectar the very soul of the grape
i'll wash my temples with some on't presently and drink some half a score draughts 'twill heat the brain kindle my imagination i shall talk nothing but crackers and fire works to night
please you to be here sir and i here so
this is worth the observation signior
now sir here's to you and i present you with so much of my love
i take it kindly from you sir
and will return you the like proportion but withal sir remembering the merry night we had at the countess's you know where sir
by heaven you put me in mind now of a very necessary office which i will propose in your pledge sir the health of that honourable countess and the sweet lady that sat by her sir
i do vail to it with reverence and now signior with these ladies i'll be bold to mix the health of your divine mistress
do you know her sir
o lord sir ay and in the respectful memory and mention of her i could wish this wine were the most precious drug in the world
good faith sir you do honour me in't exceedingly
whom should he personate in this signior
faith i know not sir observe observe him
if it were the basest filth or mud that runs in the channel i am bound to pledge it respectively sir
and now sir here is a replenish'd bowl which i will reciprocally turn upon you to the health of the count frugale
the count frugale's health sir
i'll pledge it on my knees by this light
nay do me right sir
so i do in faith
good faith you do not mine was fuller
why believe me it was not
believe me it was and you do lie
o come stab if you have a mind to it
dost thou think i dare not
nay i beseech you gentlemen what means this
nay look for shame respect your reputations
why how now carlo
o my good mischief
where are the rest where are the rest
faith three of our ordnance are burst
but did not the train hold
o yes and the poor lady is irrecoverably blown up
why but which of the munition is miscarried ha
imprimis sir puntarvolo next the countenance and resolution
how how for the love of wit
troth the resolution is proved recreant the countenance hath changed his copy and the passionate knight is shedding funeral tears over his departed dog
is his dog dead
poison'd 'tis thought marry how or by whom that's left for some cunning woman here o' the bank side to resolve
for my part i know nothing more than that we are like to have an exceeding melancholy supper of it
'slife and i had purposed to be extraordinarily merry i had drunk off a good preparative of old sack here but will they come will they come
they will assuredly come marry carlo as thou lov'st me run over 'em all freely to night and especially the knight spare no sulphurous jest that may come out of that sweaty forge of thine but ply them with all manner of shot minion saker culverin or anything what thou wilt
i warrant thee my dear case of petrionels so i stand not in dread of thee but that thou'lt second me
why my good german tapster i will
did you call master carlo
more nectar george lomtero etc
your meat's ready sir an your company were come
is the loin pork enough
ay sir it is enough
heart what dost thou with such a greasy dish
i think thou dost varnish thy face with the fat on't it looks so like a glue pot
true my raw boned rogue and if thou wouldst farce thy lean ribs with it too they would not like ragged laths rub out so many doublets as they do but thou know'st not a good dish thou
o it's the only nourishing meat in the world
no marvel though that saucy stubborn generation the jews were forbidden it for what would they have done well pamper'd with fat pork that durst murmur at their maker out of garlick and onions
fed with it the whoreson strummel patch'd goggle eyed grumble dories would have gigantomachised well said my sweet george fill fill
this savours too much of profanation
o servetur ad imum qualis ab incoepto processerit et sibi constet
"the necessity of his vein compels a toleration for bar this and dash him out of humour before his time
" "'tis an axiom in natural philosophy what comes nearest the nature of that it feeds converts quicker to nourishment and doth sooner essentiate
" now nothing in flesh and entrails assimilates or resembles man more than a hog or swine
true and he to requite their courtesy oftentimes doffeth his own nature and puts on theirs as when he becomes as churlish as a hog or as drunk as a sow but to your conclusion
marry i say nothing resembling man more than a swine it follows nothing can be more nourishing for indeed but that it abhors from our nice nature if we fed upon one another we should shoot up a great deal faster and thrive much better i refer me to your usurous cannibals or such like but since it is so contrary pork pork is your only feed
i take it your devil be of the same diet he would never have desired to have been incorporated into swine else
o here comes the melancholy mess upon 'em carlo charge charge
'fore god sir puntarvolo i am sorry for your heaviness body o' me a shrew'd mischance
why had you no unicorn's horn nor bezoar's stone about you ha
sir i would request you be silent
nay to him again
take comfort good knight if your cat have recovered her catarrh fear nothing your dog's mischance may be holpen
say how sweet carlo for so god mend me the poor knight's moans draw me into fellowship of his misfortunes
but be not discouraged good sir puntarvolo i am content your adventure shall be performed upon your cat
i believe you musk cod i believe you for rather than thou would'st make present repayment thou would'st take it upon his own bare return from calais nay 'slife he'd be content so he were well rid out of his company to pay him five for one at his next meeting him in paul's
but for your dog sir puntarvolo if he be not out right dead there is a friend of mine a quack salver shall put life in him again that's certain
o no that comes too late

faith sir 'tist hus
your wife's brother signior fungoso being at supper to night at a tavern with a sort of gallants there happened some division amongst them and he is left in pawn for the reckoning
now if ever you look that time shall present you with an happy occasion to do your wife some gracious and acceptable service take hold of this opportunity and presently go and redeem him for being her brother and his credit so amply engaged as now it is when she shall hear as he cannot himself but he must out of extremity report it that you came and offered y ourself so kindly and with that respect of his reputation why the benefit cannot but make her dote and grow mad of your affections
now by heaven macilente i acknowledge myself exceedingly indebted to you by this kind tender of your love and i am sorry to remember that i was ever so rude to neglect a friend of your importance
bring me shoes and a cloak here
i was going to bed if you had not come
what tavern is it
good faith it cannot but please her exceedingly
come i marle what piece of night work you have in hand now that you call for a cloak and your shoes what is this your pander
o sweet wife speak lower i would not he should hear thee for a world hang him rascal i cannot abide him for his treachery with his wild quick set beard there
whither go you now with him
no whither with him dear wife i go alone to a place from whence i will return instantly
good macilente acquaint not her with it by any means it may come so much the more accepted frame some other answer
i'll come back immediately
nay an i be not worthy to know whither you go stay till i take knowledge of your coming back
hear you mistress deliro
so sir and what say you
faith lady my intents will not deserve this slight respect when you shall know them
why what may your intents be for god's sake
troth the time allows no circumstance lady therefore know this was but a device to remove your husband hence and bestow him securely whilst with more conveniency i might report to you a misfortune that hath happened to monsieur brisk nay comfort sweet lady
this night being at supper a sort of young gallants committed a riot for the which he only is apprehended and carried to the counter where if your husband and other creditors should but have knowledge of him the poor gentleman were undone for ever
now therefore if you can think upon any present means for his delivery do not foreslow it
a bribe to the officer that committed him will do it
he shall not want for a bribe pray you will you commend me to him and say i'll visit him presently
no lady i shall do you better service in protracting your husband's return that you may go with more safety
good truth so you may farewell good sir
lord how a woman may be mistaken in a man
i would have sworn upon all the testaments in the world he had not loved master brisk
bring me my keys there maid
alas good gentleman if all i have in this earthly world will pleasure him it shall be at his service
how macilente sweats in this business if you mark him
ay you shall see the true picture of spite anon here comes the pawn and his redeemer
a come brother be not discouraged for this man what
no truly i am not discouraged but i protest to you brother i have done imitating any more gallants either in purse or apparel but as shall become a gentleman for good carriage or so
this is all in the bill here is it not
there's your money tell it and brother i am glad i met with so good occasion to shew my love to you
i will study to deserve it in good truth an i live
what is it right
ay sir and i thank you
let me have a capon's leg saved now the reckoning is paid
you shall sir where's signior deliro
hark you sir have you dispatch'd this same
ay marry have well then i can tell you news brisk is in the counter
'tis true sir committed for the stir here to night
now would i have you send your brother home afore him with the report of this your kindness done him to his sister which will so pleasingly possess her and out of his mouth too that in the meantime you may clap your action on brisk and your wife being in so happy a mood cannot entertain it ill by any means
'tis very true she cannot indeed i think
why 'tis past thought you shall never meet the like opportunity i assure you
i will do it
brother pray you go home afore this gentleman and i have some private business and tell my sweet wife i'll come presently
and signior acquaint your sister how liberally and out of his bounty your brother has used you do you see
made you a man of good reckoning redeem'd that you never were possest of credit gave you as gentlemanlike terms as might be found no fault with your coming behind the fashion nor nothing
nay i am out of those humours now
well if you be out keep your distance and be not made a shot clog any more
come signior let's make haste
o master fastidious what pity is it to see so sweet a man as you are in so sour a place
as upon her lips does she mean
o this is to be imagined the counter belike
troth fair lady 'tis first the pleasure of the fates and next of the constable to have it so but i am patient and indeed comforted the more in your kind visit
nay you shall be comforted in me more than this if you please sir
i sent you word by my brother sir that my husband laid to 'rest you this morning i know now whether you received it or no
no believe it sweet creature your brother gave me no such intelligence
but has your husband any such purpose
o sweet master brisk yes and therefore be presently discharged for if he come with his actions upon you lord deliver you
you are in for one half a score year he kept a poor man in ludgate once twelve year for sixteen shillings
for love's sake call him let him take a bribe and despatch you
lord how my heart trembles
here are no spies are there
why are you in this passion
o lord master fastidious if you knew how i took up my husband to day when he said he would arrest you and how i railed at him that persuaded him to it the scholar there who on my conscience loves you now and what care i took to send you intelligence by my brother and how i gave him four sovereigns for his pains and now how i came running out hither without man or boy with me so soon as i heard on't you'd say i were in a passion indeed
your keeper for god's sake
o master brisk as 'tis in 'euphues' 'hard is the choice when one is compelled either by silence to die with grief or by speaking to live with shame'
fair lady i conceive you and may this kiss assure you that where adversity hath as it were contracted prosperity shall not od's me
why how now signior deliro
has the wolf seen you ha
hath gorgon's head made marble of you
some planet strike me dead
why look you sir i told you you might have suspected this long afore had you pleased and have saved this labour of admiration now and passion and such extremities as this frail lump of flesh is subject unto
nay why do you not doat now signior
methinks you should say it were some enchantment 'deceptio visus' or so ha
if you could persuade yourself it were a dream now 'twere excellent faith try what you can do signior it may be your imagination will be brought to it in time there's nothing impossible
did you see how ill that stale vein became him afore of 'sweet wife' and 'dear heart' and are you fallen just into the same now with 'sweet husband'
away follow him go keep state what
remember you are a woman turn impudent give him not the head though you give him the horns
and yet methinks you should take your leave of 'enfant perdu' here your forlorn hope
how now monsieur brisk
friday night and in affliction too and yet your pulpamenta your delicate morsels
i perceive the affection of ladies and gentlewomen pursues you wheresoever you go monsieur
now in good faith and as i am gentle there could not have come a thing in this world to have distracted me more than the wrinkled fortunes of this poor dame
o yes sir i can tell you a think will distract you much better believe it signior deliro has entered three actions against you three actions monsieur
marry one of them i'll put you in comfort is but three thousand and the other two some five thousand pound together trifles trifles
o i am undone
nay not altogether so sir the knight must have his hundred pound repaid that will help too and then six score pounds for a diamond you know where
these be things will weigh monsieur they will weigh
this is to 'kiss the hand of a countess' to 'have her coach sent for you' to 'hang poniards in ladies' garters' to 'wear bracelets of their hair' and for every one of these great favours to 'give some slight jewel of five hundred crowns or so' why 'tis nothing
now monsieur you see the plague that treads on the heels o' your foppery well go your ways in remove yourself to the two penny ward quickly to save charges and there set up your rest to spend sir puntarvolo's hundred pound for him
away good pomander go
why here's a change
now is my soul at peace i am as empty of all envy now as they of merit to be envied at
my humour like a flame no longer lasts than it hath stuff to feed it and their folly being now raked up in their repentant ashes affords no ampler subject to my spleen
i am so far from malicing their states that i begin to pity them
it grieves me to think they have a being
i could wish they might turn wise upon it and be saved now so heaven were pleased but let them vanish vapours
gentlemen how like you it
has't not been tedious
nay we have done censuring now
marry because we'll imitate your actors and be out of our humours
besides here are those round about you of more ability in censure than we whose judgments can give it a more satisfying allowance we'll refer you to them
ay is it even so
well gentlemen i should have gone in and return'd to you as i was asper at the first but by reason the shift would have been somewhat long and we are loth to draw your patience farther we'll entreat you to imagine it
and now that you may see i will be out of humour for company i stand wholly to your kind approbation and indeed am nothing so peremptory as i was in the beginning marry i will not do as plautus in his 'amphytrio' for all this 'summi jovis causa plaudite' beg a plaudite for god's sake but if you out of the bounty of your good liking will bestow it why you may in time make lean macilente as fat as sir john falstaff
never till now did object greet mine eyes with any light content but in her graces all my malicious powers have lost their stings
envy is fled from my soul at sight of her and she hath chased all black thoughts from my bosom like as the sun doth darkness from the world my stream of humour is run out of me and as our city's torrent bent t'infect the hallow'd bowels of the silver thames is check'd by strength and clearness of the river till it hath spent itself even at the shore so in the ample and unmeasured flood of her perfections are my passions drown'd and i have now a spirit as sweet and clear as the more rarefied and subtle air with which and with a heart as pure as fire yet humble as the earth do i implore o heaven that she whose presence hath effected this change in me may suffer most late change in her admired and happy government may still this island be call'd fortunate and rugged treason tremble at the sound when fame shall speak it with an emphasis
let foreign polity be dull as lead and pale invasion come with half a heart when he but looks upon her blessed soil
the throat of war be stopt within her land and turtle footed peace dance fairy rings about her court where never may there come suspect or danger but all trust and safety
let flattery be dumb and envy blind in her dread presence death himself admire her and may her virtues make him to forget the use of his inevitable hand
fly from her age sleep time before her throne our strongest wall falls down when she is gone
