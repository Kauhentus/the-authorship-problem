i i enter and you are welcome to your country dear antonio you have been long in france and you return a very formal frenchman in your habit how do you like the french court
i admire it in seeking to reduce both state and people to a fix'd order their judicious king begins at home quits first his royal palace of flattering sycophants of dissolute and infamous persons which he sweetly terms his master's master piece the work of heaven considering duly that a prince's court is like a common fountain whence should flow pure silver drops in general but if 't chance some curs'd example poison 't near the head death and diseases through the whole land spread
and what is 't makes this blessed government but a most provident council who dare freely inform him the corruption of the times
though some o' the court hold it presumption to instruct princes what they ought to do it is a noble duty to inform them what they ought to foresee
here comes bosola the only court gall yet i observe his railing is not for simple love of piety indeed he rails at those things which he wants would be as lecherous covetous or proud bloody or envious as any man if he had means to be so
enter and i do haunt you still
i have done you better service than to be slighted thus
miserable age where only the reward of doing well is the doing of it
you enforce your merit too much
i fell into the galleys in your service where for two years together i wore two towels instead of a shirt with a knot on the shoulder after the fashion of a roman mantle
i will thrive some way
black birds fatten best in hard weather why not i in these dog days
would you could become honest
with all your divinity do but direct me the way to it
i have known many travel far for it and yet return as arrant knaves as they went forth because they carried themselves always along with them
exit are you gone
some fellows they say are possessed with the devil but this great fellow were able to possess the greatest devil and make him worse
he hath denied thee some suit
he and his brother are like plum trees that grow crooked over standing pools they are rich and o'erladen with fruit but none but crows pies and caterpillars feed on them
could i be one of their flattering panders i would hang on their ears like a horseleech till i were full and then drop off
i pray leave me
who would rely upon these miserable dependencies in expectation to be advanc'd to morrow
what creature ever fed worse than hoping tantalus
nor ever died any man more fearfully than he that hoped for a pardon
there are rewards for hawks and dogs when they have done us service but for a soldier that hazards his limbs in a battle nothing but a kind of geometry is his last supportation
ay to hang in a fair pair of slings take his latter swing in the world upon an honourable pair of crutches from hospital to hospital
fare ye well sir and yet do not you scorn us for places in the court are but like beds in the hospital where this man's head lies at that man's foot and so lower and lower
i knew this fellow seven years in the galleys for a notorious murder and 'twas thought the cardinal suborn'd it he was releas'd by the french general gaston de foix when he recover'd naples
'tis great pity he should be thus neglected i have heard he 's very valiant
this foul melancholy will poison all his goodness for i 'll tell you if too immoderate sleep be truly said to be an inward rust unto the soul if then doth follow want of action breeds all black malcontents and their close rearing like moths in cloth do hurt for want of wearing
enter and the presence 'gins to fill you promis'd me to make me the partaker of the natures of some of your great courtiers
the lord cardinal's and other strangers' that are now in court
here comes the great calabrian duke
enter and attendants who took the ring oftenest
antonio bologna my lord
our sister duchess' great master of her household
give him the jewel
when shall we leave this sportive action and fall to action indeed
methinks my lord you should not desire to go to war in person
now for some gravity
it is fitting a soldier arise to be a prince but not necessary a prince descend to be a captain
no my lord he were far better do it by a deputy
why should he not as well sleep or eat by a deputy
this might take idle offensive and base office from him whereas the other deprives him of honour
believe my experience that realm is never long in quiet where the ruler is a soldier
thou toldest me thy wife could not endure fighting
and of a jest she broke of a captain she met full of wounds i have forgot it
she told him my lord he was a pitiful fellow to lie like the children of ismael all in tents
why there's a wit were able to undo all the chirurgeons o' the city for although gallants should quarrel and had drawn their weapons and were ready to go to it yet her persuasions would make them put up
that she would my lord
how do you like my spanish gennet
he is all fire
i am of pliny's opinion i think he was begot by the wind he runs as if he were ballass'd with quicksilver
true my lord he reels from the tilt often
why do you laugh
methinks you that are courtiers should be my touch wood take fire when i give fire that is laugh when i laugh were the subject never so witty
true my lord i myself have heard a very good jest and have scorn'd to seem to have so silly a wit as to understand it
but i can laugh at your fool my lord
he cannot speak you know but he makes faces my lady cannot abide him
nor endure to be in merry company for she says too much laughing and too much company fills her too full of the wrinkle
i would then have a mathematical instrument made for her face that she might not laugh out of compass
i shall shortly visit you at milan lord silvio
your grace shall arrive most welcome
you are a good horseman antonio you have excellent riders in france what do you think of good horsemanship
nobly my lord as out of the grecian horse issued many famous princes so out of brave horsemanship arise the first sparks of growing resolution that raise the mind to noble action
you have bespoke it worthily
your brother the lord cardinal and sister duchess
enter with and are the galleys come about
they are my lord
here 's the lord silvio is come to take his leave
now sir your promise what 's that cardinal
i mean his temper
they say he 's a brave fellow will play his five thousand crowns at tennis dance court ladies and one that hath fought single combats
some such flashes superficially hang on him for form but observe his inward character he is a melancholy churchman
the spring in his face is nothing but the engend'ring of toads where he is jealous of any man he lays worse plots for them than ever was impos'd on hercules for he strews in his way flatterers panders intelligencers atheists and a thousand such political monsters
he should have been pope but instead of coming to it by the primitive decency of the church he did bestow bribes so largely and so impudently as if he would have carried it away without heaven's knowledge
some good he hath done you have given too much of him
what 's his brother
a most perverse and turbulent nature
what appears in him mirth is merely outside if he laught heartily it is to laugh all honesty out of fashion
he speaks with others' tongues and hears men's suits with others' ears will seem to sleep o' the bench only to entrap offenders in their answers dooms men to death by information rewards by hearsay
then the law to him is like a foul black cobweb to a spider he makes it his dwelling and a prison to entangle those shall feed him
most true he never pays debts unless they be shrewd turns and those he will confess that he doth owe
last for this brother there the cardinal they that do flatter him most say oracles hang at his lips and verily i believe them for the devil speaks in them
but for their sister the right noble duchess you never fix'd your eye on three fair medals cast in one figure of so different temper
for her discourse it is so full of rapture you only will begin then to be sorry when she doth end her speech and wish in wonder she held it less vain glory to talk much than your penance to hear her
whilst she speaks she throws upon a man so sweet a look that it were able to raise one to a galliard
that lay in a dead palsy and to dote on that sweet countenance but in that look there speaketh so divine a continence as cuts off all lascivious and vain hope
her days are practis'd in such noble virtue that sure her nights nay more her very sleeps are more in heaven than other ladies' shrifts
let all sweet ladies break their flatt'ring glasses and dress themselves in her
fie antonio you play the wire drawer with her commendations
i 'll case the picture up only thus much all her particular worth grows to this sum she stains the time past lights the time to come
you must attend my lady in the gallery some half and hour hence
exeunt and sister i have a suit to you
a gentleman here daniel de bosola one that was in the galleys yes i know him
a worthy fellow he is pray let me entreat for the provisorship of your horse
your knowledge of him commends him and prefers him
we are now upon parting
good lord silvio do us commend to all our noble friends at the leaguer
you are for milan
we 'll bring you down to the haven
be sure you entertain that bosola for your intelligence
i would not be seen in 't and therefore many times i have slighted him when he did court our furtherance as this morning
antonio the great master of her household had been far fitter
you are deceiv'd in him
his nature is too honest for such business
he comes i 'll leave you
re enter i was lur'd to you
my brother here the cardinal could never abide you
never since he was in my debt
may be some oblique character in your face made him suspect you
doth he study physiognomy
there 's no more credit to be given to the face than to a sick man's urine which some call the physician's whore because she cozens him
he did suspect me wrongfully
for that you must give great men leave to take their times
distrust doth cause us seldom be deceiv'd
you see the oft shaking of the cedar tree fastens it more at root
yet take heed for to suspect a friend unworthily instructs him the next way to suspect you and prompts him to deceive you
never rain'd such showers as these without thunderbolts i' the tail of them
whose throat must i cut
your inclination to shed blood rides post before my occasion to use you
i give you that to live i' the court here and observe the duchess to note all the particulars of her haviour what suitors do solicit her for marriage and whom she best affects
she 's a young widow i would not have her marry again
do not you ask the reason but be satisfied
i say i would not
it seems you would create me one of your familiars
why a very quaint invisible devil in flesh an intelligencer
such a kind of thriving thing i would wish thee and ere long thou mayst arrive at a higher place by 't
take your devils which hell calls angels
these curs'd gifts would make you a corrupter me an impudent traitor and should i take these they'd take me to hell
sir i 'll take nothing from you that i have given
there is a place that i procur'd for you this morning the provisorship o' the horse have you heard on 't
'tis yours is 't not worth thanks
i would have you curse yourself now that your bounty which makes men truly noble e'er should make me a villain
o that to avoid ingratitude for the good deed you have done me i must do all the ill man can invent
thus the devil candies all sins o'er and what heaven terms vile that names he complimental
be yourself keep your old garb of melancholy 'twill express you envy those that stand above your reach yet strive not to come near 'em
this will gain access to private lodgings where yourself may like a politic dormouse as i have seen some feed in a lord's dish half asleep not seeming to listen to any talk and yet these rogues have cut his throat in a dream
what 's my place
the provisorship o' the horse
say then my corruption grew out of horse dung i am your creature
let good men for good deeds covet good fame since place and riches oft are bribes of shame
sometimes the devil doth preach
scene enter and we are to part from you and your own discretion must now be your director
you are a widow you know already what man is and therefore let not youth high promotion eloquence no nor anything without the addition honour sway your high blood
they are most luxurious will wed twice
their livers are more spotted than laban's sheep
diamonds are of most value they say that have pass'd through most jewellers' hands
whores by that rule are precious
will you hear me
i 'll never marry
so most widows say but commonly that motion lasts no longer than the turning of an hour glass the funeral sermon and it end both together
now hear me you live in a rank pasture here i' the court there is a kind of honey dew that 's deadly will poison your fame look to 't
be not cunning for they whose faces do belie their hearts are witches ere they arrive at twenty years ay and give the devil suck
this is terrible good counsel
hypocrisy is woven of a fine small thread subtler than vulcan's engine yet believe 't your darkest actions nay your privat'st thoughts will come to light
you may flatter yourself and take your own choice privately be married under the eaves of night think 't the best voyage that e'er you made like the irregular crab which though 't goes backward thinks that it goes right because it goes its own way but observe such weddings may more properly be said to be executed than celebrated
the marriage night is the entrance into some prison
and those joys those lustful pleasures are like heavy sleeps which do fore run man's mischief
wisdom begins at the end remember it
i think this speech between you both was studied it came so roundly off
you are my sister this was my father's poniard do you see
i 'd be loth to see 't look rusty 'cause 'twas his
i would have you give o'er these chargeable revels a visor and a mask are whispering rooms that were never built for goodness fare ye well and women like variety of courtship
what cannot a neat knave with a smooth tale make a woman believe
shall this move me
if all my royal kindred lay in my way unto this marriage i 'd make them my low footsteps
and even now even in this hate as men in some great battles by apprehending danger have achiev'd almost impossible actions i have heard soldiers say so so i through frights and threatenings will assay this dangerous venture
let old wives report i wink'd and chose a husband
cariola to thy known secrecy i have given up more than my life my fame
both shall be safe for i 'll conceal this secret from the world as warily as those that trade in poison keep poison from their children
thy protestation is ingenious and hearty i believe it
good dear soul leave me but place thyself behind the arras where thou mayst overhear us
wish me good speed for i am going into a wilderness where i shall find nor path nor friendly clue to be my guide
cariola goes behind the arras
enter i sent for you sit down take pen and ink and write are you ready
what did i say
that i should write somewhat
after these triumphs and this large expense it 's fit like thrifty husbands we inquire what 's laid up for to morrow
so please your beauteous excellence
indeed i thank you
i look young for your sake you have ta'en my cares upon you
i 'll fetch your grace the particulars of your revenue and expense
o you are an upright treasurer but you mistook for when i said i meant to make inquiry what 's laid up for to morrow i did mean what 's laid up yonder for me
i am making my will as 'tis fit princes should in perfect memory and i pray sir tell me were not one better make it smiling thus than in deep groans and terrible ghastly looks as if the gifts we parted with procur'd that violent distraction
if i had a husband now this care were quit but i intend to make you overseer
what good deed shall we first remember
begin with that first good deed began i' the world after man's creation the sacrament of marriage i 'd have you first provide for a good husband give him all
yes your excellent self
in a winding sheet
saint winifred that were a strange will
'twere stranger if there were no will in you to marry again
what do you think of marriage
i take 't as those that deny purgatory it locally contains or heaven or hell there 's no third place in 't
how do you affect it
my banishment feeding my melancholy would often reason thus
pray let 's hear it
say a man never marry nor have children what takes that from him
only the bare name of being a father or the weak delight to see the little wanton ride a cock horse upon a painted stick or hear him chatter like a taught starling
fie fie what 's all this
one of your eyes is blood shot use my ring to 't
they say 'tis very sovereign
'twas my wedding ring and i did vow never to part with it but to my second husband
you have parted with it now
yes to help your eye sight
you have made me stark blind
there is a saucy and ambitious devil is dancing in this circle
there needs small conjuration when your finger may do it thus
she puts the ring upon his finger he kneels
sir this goodly roof of yours is too low built i cannot stand upright in 't nor discourse without i raise it higher
raise yourself or if you please my hand to help you so
ambition madam is a great man's madness that is not kept in chains and close pent rooms but in fair lightsome lodgings and is girt with the wild noise of prattling visitants which makes it lunatic beyond all cure
conceive not i am so stupid but i aim whereto your favours tend but he 's a fool that being a cold would thrust his hands i' the fire to warm them
so now the ground 's broke you may discover what a wealthy mine i make your lord of
you were ill to sell yourself this dark'ning of your worth is not like that which tradesmen use i' the city their false lights are to rid bad wares off and i must tell you if you will know where breathes a complete man i speak it without flattery turn your eyes and progress through yourself
were there nor heaven nor hell i should be honest i have long serv'd virtue and ne'er ta'en wages of her
now she pays it
the misery of us that are born great
we are forc'd to woo because none dare woo us and as a tyrant doubles with his words and fearfully equivocates so we are forc'd to express our violent passions in riddles and in dreams and leave the path of simple virtue which was never made to seem the thing it is not
go go brag you have left me heartless mine is in your bosom i hope 'twill multiply love there
you do tremble make not your heart so dead a piece of flesh to fear more than to love me
sir be confident what is 't distracts you
this is flesh and blood sir 'tis not the figure cut in alabaster kneels at my husband's tomb
i do here put off all vain ceremony and only do appear to you a young widow that claims you for her husband and like a widow i use but half a blush in 't
truth speak for me i will remain the constant sanctuary of your good name
i thank you gentle love and 'cause you shall not come to me in debt being now my steward here upon your lips i sign your quietus est
this you should have begg'd now
i have seen children oft eat sweetmeats thus as fearful to devour them too soon
but for your brothers
do not think of them all discord without this circumference is only to be pitied and not fear'd yet should they know it time will easily scatter the tempest
these words should be mine and all the parts you have spoke if some part of it would not have savour'd flattery
cariola comes from behind the arras
be not amaz'd this woman 's of my counsel i have heard lawyers say a contract in a chamber per verba de presenti is absolute marriage
bless heaven this sacred gordian which let violence never untwine
and may our sweet affections like the spheres be still in motion
quickening and make the like soft music
that we may imitate the loving palms best emblem of a peaceful marriage that never bore fruit divided
what can the church force more
that fortune may not know an accident either of joy or sorrow to divide our fixed wishes
how can the church build faster
we now are man and wife and 'tis the church that must but echo this
maid stand apart i now am blind
what 's your conceit in this
i would have you lead your fortune by the hand unto your marriage bed you speak in me this for we now are one we 'll only lie and talk together and plot to appease my humorous kindred and if you please like the old tale in lay a naked sword between us keep us chaste
o let me shrowd my blushes in your bosom since 'tis the treasury of all my secrets
exeunt and whether the spirit of greatness or of woman reign most in her i know not but it shows a fearful madness
i owe her much of pity
act scene i enter and you say you would fain be taken for an eminent courtier
'tis the very main of my ambition
let me see you have a reasonable good face for 't already and your night cap expresses your ears sufficient largely
i would have you learn to twirl the strings of your band with a good grace and in a set speech at th' end of every sentence to hum three or four times or blow your nose till it smart again to recover your memory
when you come to be a president in criminal causes if you smile upon a prisoner hang him but if you frown upon him and threaten him let him be sure to scape the gallows
i would be a very merry president
do not sup o' nights 'twill beget you an admirable wit
rather it would make me have a good stomach to quarrel for they say your roaring boys eat meat seldom and that makes them so valiant
but how shall i know whether the people take me for an eminent fellow
i will teach a trick to know it give out you lie a dying and if you hear the common people curse you be sure you are taken for one of the prime night caps
enter an old lady you come from painting now
why from your scurvy face physic
to behold thee not painted inclines somewhat near a miracle
these in thy face here were deep ruts and foul sloughs the last progress
there was a lady in france that having had the small pox flayed the skin off her face to make it more level and whereas before she looked like a nutmeg grater after she resembled an abortive hedge hog
do you call this painting
no no but you call it careening of an old morphewed lady to make her disembogue again there 's rough cast phrase to your plastic
it seems you are well acquainted with my closet
one would suspect it for a shop of witchcraft to find in it the fat of serpents spawn of snakes jews' spittle and their young children's ordure and all these for the face
i would sooner eat a dead pigeon taken from the soles of the feet of one sick of the plague than kiss one of you fasting
here are two of you whose sin of your youth is the very patrimony of the physician makes him renew his foot cloth with the spring and change his high pric'd courtezan with the fall of the leaf
i do wonder you do not loathe yourselves
observe my meditation now
what thing is in this outward form of man to be belov'd
we account it ominous if nature do produce a colt or lamb a fawn or goat in any limb resembling a man and fly from 't as a prodigy man stands amaz'd to see his deformity in any other creature but himself
but in our own flesh though we bear diseases which have their true names only ta'en from beasts as the most ulcerous wolf and swinish measle though we are eaten up of lice and worms and though continually we bear about us a rotten and dead body we delight to hide it in rich tissue all our fear nay all our terror is lest our physician should put us in the ground to be made sweet
your wife 's gone to rome you two couple and get you to the wells at lucca to recover your aches
i have other work on foot
exeunt and old lady i observe our duchess is sick a days she pukes her stomach seethes the fins of her eye lids look most teeming blue she wanes i' the cheek and waxes fat i' the flank and contrary to our italian fashion wears a loose bodied gown there 's somewhat in 't
i have a trick may chance discover it a pretty one i have bought some apricocks the first our spring yields
enter and talking together apart and so long since married
let me seal your lips for ever for did i think that anything but th' air could carry these words from you i should wish you had no breath at all
now sir in your contemplation
you are studying to become a great wise fellow
o sir the opinion of wisdom is a foul tetter that runs all over a man's body if simplicity direct us to have no evil it directs us to a happy being for the subtlest folly proceeds from the subtlest wisdom let me be simply honest
i do understand your inside
because you would not seem to appear to th' world puff'd up with your preferment you continue this out of fashion melancholy leave it leave it
give me leave to be honest in any phrase in any compliment whatsoever
shall i confess myself to you
i look no higher than i can reach they are the gods that must ride on winged horses
a lawyer's mule of a slow pace will both suit my disposition and business for mark me when a man's mind rides faster than his horse can gallop they quickly both tire
you would look up to heaven but i think the devil that rules i' th' air stands in your light
o sir you are lord of the ascendant chief man with the duchess a duke was your cousin german remov'd
say you were lineally descended from king pepin or he himself what of this
search the heads of the greatest rivers in the world you shall find them but bubbles of water
some would think the souls of princes were brought forth by some more weighty cause than those of meaner persons they are deceiv'd there 's the same hand to them the like passions sway them the same reason that makes a vicar go to law for a tithe pig and undo his neighbours makes them spoil a whole province and batter down goodly cities with the cannon
enter and ladies your arm antonio do i not grow fat
i am exceeding short winded
bosola i would have you sir provide for me a litter such a one as the duchess of florence rode in
the duchess us'd one when she was great with child
i think she did
come hither mend my ruff here when
thou art such a tedious lady and thy breath smells of lemon pills would thou hadst done
shall i swoon under thy fingers
i am so troubled with the mother
i fear too much
i have heard you say that the french courtiers wear their hats on 'fore that king
i have seen it
why should not we bring up that fashion
'tis ceremony more than duty that consists in the removing of a piece of felt
be you the example to the rest o' th' court put on your hat first
you must pardon me i have seen in colder countries than in france nobles stand bare to th' prince and the distinction methought show'd reverently
i have a present for your grace
o sir where are they
i have heard of none to year aside
good her colour rises
indeed i thank you they are wondrous fair ones
what an unskilful fellow is our gardener
we shall have none this month
will not your grace pare them
no they taste of musk methinks indeed they do
i know not yet i wish your grace had par'd 'em
i forgot to tell you the knave gardener only to raise his profit by them the sooner did ripen them in horse dung
you shall judge pray taste one
indeed madam i do not love the fruit
sir you are loth to rob us of our dainties
'tis a delicate fruit they say they are restorative
'tis a pretty art this grafting
'tis so a bettering of nature
to make a pippin grow upon a crab a damson on a black thorn
how greedily she eats them
a whirlwind strike off these bawd farthingales
for but for that and the loose bodied gown i should have discover'd apparently the young springal cutting a caper in her belly
i thank you bosola they were right good ones if they do not make me sick
this green fruit and my stomach are not friends how they swell me
nay you are too much swell'd already
o i am in an extreme cold sweat
i am very sorry
lights to my chamber
o good antonio i fear i am undone
o my most trusty delio we are lost
i fear she 's fall'n in labour and there 's left no time for her remove
have you prepar'd those ladies to attend her and procur'd that politic safe conveyance for the midwife your duchess plotted
make use then of this forc'd occasion
give out that bosola hath poison'd her with these apricocks that will give some colour for her keeping close
fie fie the physicians will then flock to her
for that you may pretend she'll use some prepar'd antidote of her own lest the physicians should re poison her
i am lost in amazement i know not what to think on 't
scene enter and old lady so so there 's no question but her techiness and most vulturous eating of the apricocks are apparent signs of breeding now
i am in haste sir
there was a young waiting woman had a monstrous desire to see the glass house nay pray let me go
i will hear no more of the glass house
you are still abusing women
who no only by the way now and then mention your frailties
the orange tree bears ripe and green fruit and blossoms all together and some of you give entertainment for pure love but more for more precious reward
the lusty spring smells well but drooping autumn tastes well
if we have the same golden showers that rained in the time of jupiter the thunderer you have the same danaes still to hold up their laps to receive them
didst thou never study the mathematics
what 's that sir
why to know the trick how to make a many lines meet in one centre
go go give your foster daughters good counsel tell them that the devil takes delight to hang at a woman's girdle like a false rusty watch that she cannot discern how the time passes
enter and shut up the court gates
what 's the danger
shut up the posterns presently and call all the officers o' th' court
who keeps the key o' th' park gate
let him bring 't presently
re enter with servants o gentleman o' th' court the foulest treason
if that these apricocks should be poison'd now without my knowledge
there was taken even now a switzer in the duchess' bed chamber a switzer
with a pistol there was a cunning traitor
and all the moulds of his buttons were leaden bullets
'twas a french plot upon my life
to see what the devil can do
are all the officers here
gentlemen we have lost much plate you know and but this evening jewels to the value of four thousand ducats are missing in the duchess' cabinet
are the gates shut
'tis the duchess' pleasure each officer be lock'd into his chamber till the sun rising and to send the keys of all their chests and of their outward doors into her bed chamber
she is very sick
she entreats you take 't not ill the innocent shall be the more approv'd by it
gentlemen o' the wood yard where 's your switzer now
by this hand 'twas credibly reported by one o' the black guard
exeunt all except and how fares it with the duchess
she 's expos'd unto the worst of torture pain and fear
speak to her all happy comfort
how i do play the fool with mine own danger
you are this night dear friend to post to rome my life lies in your service
do not doubt me
o 'tis far from me and yet fear presents me somewhat that looks like danger
believe it 'tis but the shadow of your fear no more how superstitiously we mind our evils
the throwing down salt or crossing of a hare bleeding at nose the stumbling of a horse or singing of a cricket are of power to daunt whole man in us
sir fare you well i wish you all the joys of a bless'd father and for my faith lay this unto your breast old friends like old swords still are trusted best
enter sir you are the happy father of a son your wife commends him to you
for heaven' sake tend her well i 'll presently go set a figure for 's nativity
scene enter with a dark lantern sure i did hear a woman shriek list ha
and the sound came if i receiv'd it right from the duchess' lodgings
there 's some stratagem in the confining all our courtiers to their several wards i must have part of it my intelligence will freeze else
it may be 'twas the melancholy bird best friend of silence and of solitariness the owl that screamed so
enter with a candle his sword drawn i heard some noise
antonio put not your face nor body to such a forc'd expression of fear i am bosola your friend
this mole does undermine me
heard you not a noise even now
from the duchess' lodging
not i did you
i did or else i dream'd
let 's walk towards it
no it may be 'twas but the rising of the wind
methinks 'tis very cold and yet you sweat you look wildly
i have been setting a figure for the duchess' jewels
ah and how falls your question
do you find it radical
what 's that to you
'tis rather to be question'd what design when all men were commanded to their lodgings makes you a night walker
in sooth i 'll tell you now all the court 's asleep i thought the devil had least to do here i came to say my prayers and if it do offend you i do so you are a fine courtier
this fellow will undo me
you gave the duchess apricocks to day pray heaven they were not poison'd
a spanish fig for the imputation
traitors are ever confident till they are discover'd
there were jewels stol'n too in my conceit none are to be suspected more than yourself
you are a false steward
saucy slave i 'll pull thee up by the roots
may be the ruin will crush you to pieces
you are an impudent snake indeed sir are you scarce warm and do you show your sting
you libel well sir
no sir copy it out and i will set my hand to 't
one that were superstitious would count this ominous when it merely comes by chance
two letters that are wrought here for my name are drown'd in blood
for you sir i 'll take order the morn you shall be safe
'tis that must colour her lying in
sir this door you pass not i do not hold it fit that you come near the duchess' lodgings till you have quit yourself
the great are like the base nay they are the same when they seek shameful ways to avoid shame
antonio hereabout did drop a paper some of your help false friend
o here it is
a child's nativity calculated
'the duchess was deliver'd of a son 'tween the hours twelve and one in the night anno dom
' that 's this year 'decimo nono decembris' that 's this night 'taken according to the meridian of malfi' that 's our duchess happy discovery
'the lord of the first house being combust in the ascendant signifies short life and mars being in a human sign joined to the tail of the dragon in the eighth house doth threaten a violent death
' why now 'tis most apparent this precise fellow is the duchess' bawd i have it to my wish
this is a parcel of intelligency our courtiers were cas'd up for it needs must follow that i must be committed on pretence of poisoning her which i 'll endure and laugh at
if one could find the father now
but that time will discover
old castruccio th' morning posts to rome by him i 'll send a letter that shall make her brothers' galls o'erflow their livers
this was a thrifty way
though lust do mask in ne'er so strange disguise she 's oft found witty but is never wise
scene enter and sit thou art my best of wishes
prithee tell me what trick didst thou invent to come to rome without thy husband
why my lord i told him i came to visit an old anchorite here for devotion
thou art a witty false one i mean to him
you have prevail'd with me beyond my strongest thoughts i would not now find you inconstant
do not put thyself to such a voluntary torture which proceeds out of your own guilt
you fear my constancy because you have approv'd those giddy and wild turnings in yourself
did you e'er find them
sooth generally for women a man might strive to make glass malleable ere he should make them fixed
we had need go borrow that fantastic glass invented by galileo the florentine to view another spacious world i' th' moon and look to find a constant woman there
this is very well my lord
why do you weep
are tears your justification
the self same tears will fall into your husband's bosom lady with a loud protestation that you love him above the world
come i 'll love you wisely that 's jealously since i am very certain you cannot make me cuckold
i 'll go home to my husband
you may thank me lady i have taken you off your melancholy perch bore you upon my fist and show'd you game and let you fly at it
i pray thee kiss me
when thou wast with thy husband thou wast watch'd like a tame elephant still you are to thank me thou hadst only kisses from him and high feeding but what delight was that
'twas just like one that hath a little fing'ring on the lute yet cannot tune it still you are to thank me
you told me of a piteous wound i' th' heart and a sick liver when you woo'd me first and spake like one in physic
enter servant rest firm for my affection to thee lightning moves slow to 't
madam a gentleman that 's come post from malfi desires to see you
let him enter i 'll withdraw
he says your husband old castruccio is come to rome most pitifully tir'd with riding post
'tis one of my old suitors
i was bold to come and see you
sir you are welcome
do you lie here
sure your own experience will satisfy you no our roman prelates do not keep lodging for ladies
very well i have brought you no commendations from your husband for i know none by him
i hear he 's come to rome
i never knew man and beast of a horse and a knight so weary of each other
if he had had a good back he would have undertook to have borne his horse his breech was so pitifully sore
your laughter is my pity
lady i know not whether you want money but i have brought you some
no from mine own allowance
i must hear the condition ere i be bound to take it
look on 't 'tis gold hath it not a fine colour
i have a bird more beautiful
try the sound on 't
a lute string far exceeds it
it hath no smell like cassia or civet nor is it physical though some fond doctors persuade us seethe 't in cullises
i 'll tell you this is a creature bred by re enter servant your husband 's come hath deliver'd a letter to the duke of calabria that to my thinking hath put him out of his wits
sir you hear pray let me know your business and your suit as briefly as can be
with good speed i would wish you at such time as you are non resident with your husband my mistress
sir i 'll go ask my husband if i shall and straight return your answer
is this her wit or honesty that speaks thus
i heard one say the duke was highly mov'd with a letter sent from malfi
i do fear antonio is betray'd
how fearfully shows his ambition now
they pass through whirl pools and deep woes do shun who the event weigh ere the action 's done
scene v enter and with a letter i have this night digg'd up a mandrake
and i am grown mad with 't
what 's the prodigy
read there a sister damn'd she 's loose i' the hilts grown a notorious strumpet
rogues do not whisper 't now but seek to publish 't as servants do the bounty of their lords aloud and with a covetous searching eye to mark who note them
o confusion seize her
she hath had most cunning bawds to serve her turn and more secure conveyances for lust than towns of garrison for service
can this be certain
rhubarb o for rhubarb to purge this choler
here 's the cursed day to prompt my memory and here 't shall stick till of her bleeding heart i make a sponge to wipe it out
why do you make yourself so wild a tempest
would i could be one that i might toss her palace 'bout her ears root up her goodly forests blast her meads and lay her general territory as waste as she hath done her honours
shall our blood the royal blood of arragon and castile be thus attainted
apply desperate physic we must not now use balsamum but fire the smarting cupping glass for that 's the mean to purge infected blood such blood as hers
there is a kind of pity in mine eye i 'll give it to my handkercher and now 'tis here i 'll bequeath this to her bastard
why to make soft lint for his mother's wounds when i have hew'd her to pieces
unequal nature to place women's hearts so far upon the left side
foolish men that e'er will trust their honour in a bark made of so slight weak bulrush as is woman apt every minute to sink it
thus ignorance when it hath purchas'd honour it cannot wield it
methinks i see her laughing excellent hyena
talk to me somewhat quickly or my imagination will carry me to see her in the shameful act of sin
happily with some strong thigh'd bargeman or one o' th' wood yard that can quoit the sledge or toss the bar or else some lovely squire that carries coals up to her privy lodgings
you fly beyond your reason
'tis not your whore's milk that shall quench my wild fire but your whore's blood
how idly shows this rage which carries you as men convey'd by witches through the air on violent whirlwinds
this intemperate noise fitly resembles deaf men's shrill discourse who talk aloud thinking all other men to have their imperfection
have not you my palsy
yes but i can be angry without this rupture
there is not in nature a thing that makes man so deform'd so beastly as doth intemperate anger
you have divers men who never yet express'd their strong desire of rest but by unrest by vexing of themselves
come put yourself in tune
so i will only study to seem the thing i am not
i could kill her now in you or in myself for i do think it is some sin in us heaven doth revenge by her
are you stark mad
i would have their bodies burnt in a coal pit with the ventage stopp'd that their curs'd smoke might not ascend to heaven or dip the sheets they lie in in pitch or sulphur wrap them in 't and then light them like a match or else to boil their bastard to a cullis and give 't his lecherous father to renew the sin of his back
i 'll leave you
nay i have done
i am confident had i been damn'd in hell and should have heard of this it would have put me into a cold sweat
in in i 'll go sleep
till i know who loves my sister i 'll not stir that known i 'll find scorpions to string my whips and fix her in a general eclipse
act scene i enter and our noble friend my most beloved delio
o you have been a stranger long at court came you along with the lord ferdinand
i did sir and how fares your noble duchess
right fortunately well she 's an excellent feeder of pedigrees since you last saw her she hath had two children more a son and daughter
let me but wink and not behold your face which to mine eye is somewhat leaner verily i should dream it were within this half hour
you have not been in law friend delio nor in prison nor a suitor at the court nor begg'd the reversion of some great man's place nor troubled with an old wife which doth make your time so insensibly hasten
pray sir tell me hath not this news arriv'd yet to the ear of the lord cardinal
i fear it hath the lord ferdinand that 's newly come to court doth bear himself right dangerously
he is so quiet that he seems to sleep the tempest out as dormice do in winter
those houses that are haunted are most still till the devil be up
what say the common people
the common rabble do directly say she is a strumpet
and your graver heads which would be politic what censure they
they do observe i grow to infinite purchase the left hand way and all suppose the duchess would amend it if she could for say they great princes though they grudge their officers should have such large and unconfined means to get wealth under them will not complain lest thereby they should make them odious unto the people
for other obligation of love or marriage between her and me they never dream of
the lord ferdinand is going to bed
enter and attendants i 'll instantly to bed for i am weary
i am to bespeak a husband for you
pray who is 't
the great count malatesti
he 's a mere stick of sugar candy you may look quite through him
when i choose a husband i will marry for your honour
you shall do well in 't
how is 't worthy antonio
but sir i am to have private conference with you about a scandalous report is spread touching mine honour
let me be ever deaf to 't one of pasquil's paper bullets court calumny a pestilent air which princes' palaces are seldom purg'd of
yet say that it were true i pour it in your bosom my fix'd love would strongly excuse extenuate nay deny faults were they apparent in you
go be safe in your own innocency
this deadly air is purg'd
her guilt treads on hot burning coulters
enter now bosola how thrives our intelligence
sir uncertainly 'tis rumour'd she hath had three bastards but by whom we may go read i' the stars
why some hold opinion all things are written there
yes if we could find spectacles to read them
i do suspect there hath been some sorcery us'd on the duchess
to make her dote on some desertless fellow she shames to acknowledge
can your faith give way to think there 's power in potions or in charms to make us love whether we will or no
these are mere gulleries horrid things invented by some cheating mountebanks to abuse us
do you think that herbs or charms can force the will
some trials have been made in this foolish practice but the ingredients were lenitive poisons such as are of force to make the patient mad and straight the witch swears by equivocation they are in love
the witch craft lies in her rank blood
this night i will force confession from her
you told me you had got within these two days a false key into her bed chamber
as i would wish
what do you intend to do
do not ask then he that can compass me and know my drifts may say he hath put a girdle 'bout the world and sounded all her quick sands
i do not think so
what do you think then pray
that you are your own chronicle too much and grossly flatter yourself
give me thy hand i thank thee i never gave pension but to flatterers till i entertained thee
that friend a great man's ruin strongly checks who rails into his belief all his defects
scene enter and bring me the casket hither and the glass
you get no lodging here to night my lord
indeed i must persuade one
very good i hope in time 'twill grow into a custom that noblemen shall come with cap and knee to purchase a night's lodging of their wives
i must lie here
you are a lord of mis rule
indeed my rule is only in the night
i 'll stop your mouth
nay that 's but one venus had two soft doves to draw her chariot i must have another
she kisses him again
when wilt thou marry cariola
o fie upon this single life
we read how daphne for her peevish flight became a fruitless bay tree syrinx turn'd to the pale empty reed anaxarete was frozen into marble whereas those which married or prov'd kind unto their friends were by a gracious influence transhap'd into the olive pomegranate mulberry became flowers precious stones or eminent stars
this is a vain poetry but i pray you tell me if there were propos'd me wisdom riches and beauty in three several young men which should i choose
'tis a hard question
this was paris' case and he was blind in 't and there was a great cause for how was 't possible he could judge right having three amorous goddesses in view and they stark naked
'twas a motion were able to benight the apprehension of the severest counsellor of europe
now i look on both your faces so well form'd it puts me in mind of a question i would ask
i do wonder why hard favour'd ladies for the most part keep worse favour'd waiting women to attend them and cannot endure fair ones
o that 's soon answer'd
did you ever in your life know an ill painter desire to have his dwelling next door to the shop of an excellent picture maker
'twould disgrace his face making and undo him
i prithee when were we so merry
pray thee cariola let 's steal forth the room and let her talk to herself i have divers times serv'd her the like when she hath chaf'd extremely
i love to see her angry
exeunt and doth not the colour of my hair 'gin to change
when i wax gray i shall have all the court powder their hair with arras to be like me
you have cause to love me i ent'red you into my heart enter unseen before you would vouchsafe to call for the keys
we shall one day have my brothers take you napping
methinks his presence being now in court should make you keep your own bed but you 'll say love mix'd with fear is sweetest
i 'll assure you you shall get no more children till my brothers consent to be your gossips
have you lost your tongue
'tis welcome for know whether i am doom'd to live or die i can do both like a prince
giving her a poniard
virtue where art thou hid
what hideous thing is it that doth eclipse thee
pray sir hear me
or is it true thou art but a bare name and no essential thing
sir do not speak
no sir i will plant my soul in mine ears to hear you
o most imperfect light of human reason that mak'st us so unhappy to foresee what we can least prevent
pursue thy wishes and glory in them there 's in shame no comfort but to be past all bounds and sense of shame
i pray sir hear me i am married
happily not to your liking but for that alas your shears do come untimely now to clip the bird's wings that 's already flown
will you see my husband
yes if i could change eyes with a basilisk
sure you came hither by his confederacy
the howling of a wolf is music to thee screech owl prithee peace
whate'er thou art that hast enjoy'd my sister for i am sure thou hear'st me for thine own sake let me not know thee
i came hither prepar'd to work thy discovery yet am now persuaded it would beget such violent effects as would damn us both
i would not for ten millions i had beheld thee therefore use all means i never may have knowledge of thy name enjoy thy lust still and a wretched life on that condition
and for thee vile woman if thou do wish thy lecher may grow old in thy embracements i would have thee build such a room for him as our anchorites to holier use inhabit
let not the sun shine on him till he 's dead let dogs and monkeys only converse with him and such dumb things to whom nature denies use to sound his name do not keep a paraquito lest she learn it if thou do love him cut out thine own tongue lest it bewray him
why might not i marry
i have not gone about in this to create any new world or custom
thou art undone and thou hast ta'en that massy sheet of lead that hid thy husband's bones and folded it about my heart
mine bleeds for 't
what should i name 't unless a hollow bullet fill'd with unquenchable wild fire
you are in this too strict and were you not my princely brother i would say too wilful my reputation is safe
dost thou know what reputation is
i 'll tell thee to small purpose since the instruction comes now too late
upon a time reputation love and death would travel o'er the world and it was concluded that they should part and take three several ways
death told them they should find him in great battles or cities plagu'd with plagues love gives them counsel to inquire for him 'mongst unambitious shepherds where dowries were not talk'd of and sometimes 'mongst quiet kindred that had nothing left by their dead parents 'stay' quoth reputation 'do not forsake me for it is my nature if once i part from any man i meet i am never found again
' and so for you you have shook hands with reputation and made him invisible
so fare you well i will never see you more
why should only i of all the other princes of the world be cas'd up like a holy relic
i have youth and a little beauty
so you have some virgins that are witches
i will never see thee more
re enter with a pistol and you saw this apparition
yes we are betray'd
how came he hither
i should turn this to thee for that
pray sir do and when that you have cleft my heart you shall read there mine innocence
that gallery gave him entrance
i would this terrible thing would come again that standing on my guard i might relate my warrantable love
she shows the poniard
he left this with me
and it seems did wish you would use it on yourself
his action seem'd to intend so much
this hath a handle to 't as well as a point turn it towards him and so fasten the keen edge in his rank gall
i stand as if a mine beneath my feet were ready to be blown up
methinks unjust actions should wear these masks and curtains and not we
you must instantly part hence i have fashion'd it already
exit enter the duke your brother is ta'en up in a whirlwind hath took horse and 's rid post to rome
he told me as he mounted into the saddle you were undone
indeed i am very near it
what 's the matter
antonio the master of our household hath dealt so falsely with me in 's accounts
my brother stood engag'd with me for money ta'en up of certain neapolitan jews and antonio lets the bonds be forfeit
and hereupon my brother's bills at naples are protested against
call up our officers
re enter the place that you must fly to is ancona hire a house there i 'll send after you my treasure and my jewels
our weak safety runs upon enginous wheels short syllables must stand for periods
i must now accuse you of such a feigned crime as tasso calls magnanima menzogna a noble lie 'cause it must shield our honours
re enter and officers will your grace hear me
i have got well by you you have yielded me a million of loss i am like to inherit the people's curses for your stewardship
you had the trick in audit time to be sick till i had sign'd your quietus and that cur'd you without help of a doctor
gentlemen i would have this man be an example to you all so shall you hold my favour i pray let him for h'as done that alas you would not think of and because i intend to be rid of him i mean not to publish
use your fortune elsewhere
i am strongly arm'd to brook my overthrow as commonly men bear with a hard year
i will not blame the cause on 't but do think the necessity of my malevolent star procures this not her humour
o the inconstant and rotten ground of service
you may see 'tis even like him that in a winter night takes a long slumber o'er a dying fire a loth to part from 't yet parts thence as cold as when he first sat down
we do confiscate towards the satisfying of your accounts all that you have
i am all yours and 'tis very fit all mine should be so
so sir you have your pass
you may see gentlemen what 'tis to serve a prince with body and soul
here 's an example for extortion what moisture is drawn out of the sea when foul weather comes pours down and runs into the sea again
i would know what are your opinions of this antonio
he could not abide to see a pig's head gaping i thought your grace would find him a jew
i would you had been his officer for your own sake
you would have had more money
he stopped his ears with black wool and to those came to him for money said he was thick of hearing
some said he was an hermaphrodite for he could not abide a woman
how scurvy proud he would look when the treasury was full
well let him go
yes and the chippings of the buttery fly after him to scour his gold chain
what do you think of these
that these are rogues that in 's prosperity but to have waited on his fortune could have wish'd his dirty stirrup riveted through their noses and follow'd after 's mule like a bear in a ring would have prostituted their daughters to his lust made their first born intelligencers thought none happy but such as were born under his blest planet and wore his livery and do these lice drop off now
well never look to have the like again he hath left a sort of flattering rogues behind him their doom must follow
princes pay flatterers in their own money flatterers dissemble their vices and they dissemble their lies that 's justice
he hath amply fill'd his coffers
sure he was too honest
pluto the god of riches when he 's sent by jupiter to any man he goes limping to signify that wealth that comes on god's name comes slowly but when he's sent on the devil's errand he rides post and comes in by scuttles
let me show you what a most unvalu'd jewel you have in a wanton humour thrown away to bless the man shall find him
he was an excellent courtier and most faithful a soldier that thought it as beastly to know his own value too little as devilish to acknowledge it too much
both his virtue and form deserv'd a far better fortune his discourse rather delighted to judge itself than show itself his breast was fill'd with all perfection and yet it seemed a private whisp'ring room it made so little noise of 't
but he was basely descended
will you make yourself a mercenary herald rather to examine men's pedigrees than virtues
you shall want him for know an honest statesman to a prince is like a cedar planted by a spring the spring bathes the tree's root the grateful tree rewards it with his shadow you have not done so
i would sooner swim to the bermoothes on two politicians' rotten bladders tied together with an intelligencer's heart string than depend on so changeable a prince's favour
fare thee well antonio
since the malice of the world would needs down with thee it cannot be said yet that any ill happen'd unto thee considering thy fall was accompanied with virtue
o you render me excellent music
this good one that you speak of is my husband
do i not dream
can this ambitious age have so much goodness in 't as to prefer a man merely for worth without these shadows of wealth and painted honours
i have had three children by him
for you have made your private nuptial bed the humble and fair seminary of peace no question but many an unbenefic'd scholar shall pray for you for this deed and rejoice that some preferment in the world can yet arise from merit
the virgins of your land that have no dowries shall hope your example will raise them to rich husbands
should you want soldiers 'twould make the very turks and moors turn christians and serve you for this act
last the neglected poets of your time in honour of this trophy of a man rais'd by that curious engine your white hand shall thank you in your grave for 't and make that more reverend than all the cabinets of living princes
for antonio his fame shall likewise flow from many a pen when heralds shall want coats to sell to men
as i taste comfort in this friendly speech so would i find concealment
o the secret of my prince which i will wear on th' inside of my heart
you shall take charge of all my coin and jewels and follow him for he retires himself to ancona
whither within few days i mean to follow thee
let me think i would wish your grace to feign a pilgrimage to our lady of loretto scarce seven leagues from fair ancona so may you depart your country with more honour and your flight will seem a princely progress retaining your usual train about you
sir your direction shall lead me by the hand
in my opinion she were better progress to the baths at lucca or go visit the spa in germany for if you will believe me i do not like this jesting with religion this feigned pilgrimage
thou art a superstitious fool prepare us instantly for our departure
past sorrows let us moderately lament them for those to come seek wisely to prevent them
exeunt and a politician is the devil's quilted anvil he fashions all sins on him and the blows are never heard he may work in a lady's chamber as here for proof
what rests but i reveal all to my lord
o this base quality of intelligencer
why every quality i' the world prefers but gain or commendation now for this act i am certain to be rais'd and men that paint weeds to the life are prais'd
scene enter and must we turn soldier then
the emperor hearing your worth that way ere you attain'd this reverend garment joins you in commission with the right fortunate soldier the marquis of pescara and the famous lannoy
he that had the honour of taking the french king prisoner
here 's a plot drawn for a new fortification at naples
this great count malatesti i perceive hath got employment
no employment my lord a marginal note in the muster book that he is a voluntary lord
he 's no soldier
he has worn gun powder in 's hollow tooth for the tooth ache
he comes to the leaguer with a full intent to eat fresh beef and garlic means to stay till the scent be gone and straight return to court
he hath read all the late service as the city chronicle relates it and keeps two pewterers going only to express battles in model
then he 'll fight by the book
by the almanac i think to choose good days and shun the critical that 's his mistress' scarf
yes he protests he would do much for that taffeta
i think he would run away from a battle to save it from taking prisoner
he is horribly afraid gun powder will spoil the perfume on 't
i saw a dutchman break his pate once for calling him pot gun he made his head have a bore in 't like a musket
i would he had made a touch hole to 't
he is indeed a guarded sumpter cloth only for the remove of the court
what should be the business
some falling out amongst the cardinals
these factions amongst great men they are like foxes when their heads are divided they carry fire in their tails and all the country about them goes to wrack for 't
what 's that bosola
i knew him in padua a fantastical scholar like such who study to know how many knots was in hercules' club of what colour achilles' beard was or whether hector were not troubled with the tooth ache
he hath studied himself half blear eyed to know the true symmetry of caesar's nose by a shoeing horn and this he did to gain the name of a speculative man
mark prince ferdinand a very salamander lives in 's eye to mock the eager violence of fire
that cardinal hath made more bad faces with his oppression than ever michael angelo made good ones
he lifts up 's nose like a foul porpoise before a storm
the lord ferdinand laughs
like a deadly cannon that lightens ere it smokes
these are your true pangs of death the pangs of life that struggle with great statesmen
in such a deformed silence witches whisper their charms
doth she make religion her riding hood to keep her from the sun and tempest
that that damns her
methinks her fault and beauty blended together show like leprosy the whiter the fouler
i make it a question whether her beggarly brats were ever christ'ned
i will instantly solicit the state of ancona to have them banish'd
you are for loretto i shall not be at your ceremony fare you well
write to the duke of malfi my young nephew she had by her first husband and acquaint him with 's mother's honesty
a slave that only smell'd of ink and counters and never in 's life look'd like a gentleman but in the audit time
go go presently draw me out an hundred and fifty of our horse and meet me at the foot bridge
scene enter two pilgrims to the shrine of our lady of loretto i have not seen a goodlier shrine than this yet i have visited many
the cardinal of arragon is this day to resign his cardinal's hat his sister duchess likewise is arriv'd to pay her vow of pilgrimage
i expect a noble ceremony
here the ceremony of the cardinal's instalment in the habit of a soldier perform'd in delivering up his cross hat robes and ring at the shrine and investing him with sword helmet shield and spurs then the and their children having presented themselves at the shrine are by a form of banishment in dumb show expressed towards them by the and the state of ancona banished during all which ceremony this ditty is sung to very solemn music by divers churchmen and then exeunt all except the two pilgrims
arms and honours deck thy story to thy fame's eternal glory
adverse fortune ever fly thee no disastrous fate come nigh thee
i alone will sing thy praises whom to honour virtue raises and thy study that divine is bent to martial discipline is lay aside all those robes lie by thee crown thy arts with arms they 'll beautify thee
o worthy of worthiest name adorn'd in this manner lead bravely thy forces on under war's warlike banner
o mayst thou prove fortunate in all martial courses
guide thou still by skill in arts and forces
victory attend thee nigh whilst fame sings loud thy powers triumphant conquest crown thy head and blessings pour down showers
here 's a strange turn of state
who would have thought so great a lady would have match'd herself unto so mean a person
yet the cardinal bears himself much too cruel
but i would ask what power hath this state of ancona to determine of a free prince
they are a free state sir and her brother show'd how that the pope fore hearing of her looseness hath seiz'd into th' protection of the church the dukedom which she held as dowager
but by what justice
sure i think by none only her brother's instigation
what was it with such violence he took off from her finger
'twas her wedding ring which he vow'd shortly he would sacrifice to his revenge
if that a man be thrust into a well no matter who sets hand to 't his own weight will bring him sooner to th' bottom
come let 's hence
fortune makes this conclusion general all things do help th' unhappy man to fall
scene v enter children and servants banish'd ancona
yes you see what power lightens in great men's breath
is all our train shrunk to this poor remainder
these poor men which have got little in your service vow to take your fortune but your wiser buntings now they are fledg'd are gone
they have done wisely
this puts me in mind of death physicians thus with their hands full of money use to give o'er their patients
right the fashion of the world from decay'd fortunes every flatterer shrinks men cease to build where the foundation sinks
i had a very strange dream to night
methought i wore my coronet of state and on a sudden all the diamonds were chang'd to pearls
my interpretation is you 'll weep shortly for to me the pearls do signify your tears
the birds that live i' th' field on the wild benefit of nature live happier than we for they may choose their mates and carol their sweet pleasures to the spring
enter with a letter you are happily o'erta'en
yes from the lord ferdinand your brother all love and safety
thou dost blanch mischief would'st make it white
see see like to calm weather at sea before a tempest false hearts speak fair to those they intend most mischief
'send antonio to me i want his head in a business
' a politic equivocation
he doth not want your counsel but your head that is he cannot sleep till you be dead
and here 's another pitfall that 's strew'd o'er with roses mark it 'tis a cunning one reads
stand engaged for your husband for several debts at naples let not that trouble him i had rather have his heart than his money' and i believe so too
what do you believe
that he so much distrusts my husband's love he will by no means believe his heart is with him until he see it the devil is not cunning enough to circumvent us in riddles
will you reject that noble and free league of amity and love which i present you
their league is like that of some politic kings only to make themselves of strength and power to be our after ruin tell them so
and what from you
thus tell him i will not come
and what of this
my brothers have dispers'd bloodhounds abroad which till i hear are muzzl'd no truce though hatch'd with ne'er such politic skill is safe that hangs upon our enemies' will
i 'll not come at them
this proclaims your breeding
every small thing draws a base mind to fear as the adamant draws iron
fare you well sir you shall shortly hear from 's
i suspect some ambush therefore by all my love i do conjure you to take your eldest son and fly towards milan
let us not venture all this poor remainder in one unlucky bottom
best of my life farewell
since we must part heaven hath a hand in 't but no otherwise than as some curious artist takes in sunder a clock or watch when it is out of frame to bring 't in better order
i know not which is best to see you dead or part with you
farewell boy thou art happy that thou hast not understanding to know thy misery for all our wit and reading brings us to a truer sense of sorrow
in the eternal church sir i do hope we shall not part thus
o be of comfort
make patience a noble fortitude and think not how unkindly we are us'd man like to cassia is prov'd best being bruis'd
must i like to slave born russian account it praise to suffer tyranny
and yet o heaven thy heavy hand is in 't
i have seen my little boy oft scourge his top and compar'd myself to 't naught made me e'er go right but heaven's scourge stick
do not weep heaven fashion'd us of nothing and we strive to bring ourselves to nothing
farewell cariola and thy sweet armful
if i do never see thee more be a good mother to your little ones and save them from the tiger fare you well
let me look upon you once more for that speech came from a dying father
your kiss is colder than that i have seen an holy anchorite give to a dead man's skull
my heart is turn'd to a heavy lump of lead with which i sound my danger fare you well
exeunt and his son
my laurel is all withered
look madam what a troop of armed men make toward us
re enter visarded with a guard o they are very welcome when fortune's wheel is over charg'd with princes the weight makes it move swift i would have my ruin be sudden
i am your adventure am i not
you are you must see your husband no more
what devil art thou that counterfeit'st heaven's thunder
i would have you tell me whether is that note worse that frights the silly birds out of the corn or that which doth allure them to the nets
you have heark'ned to the last too much
like to a rusty o'ercharg'd cannon shall i never fly in pieces
come to what prison
i have heard that charon's boat serves to convey all o'er the dismal lake but brings none back again
your brothers mean you safety and pity
with such a pity men preserve alive pheasants and quails when they are not fat enough to be eaten
these are your children
no but i intend since they were born accurs'd curses shall be their first language
forget this base low fellow were i a man i 'd beat that counterfeit face into thy other
one of no birth
say that he was born mean man is most happy when 's own actions be arguments and examples of his virtue
a barren beggarly virtue
i prithee who is greatest
sad tales befit my woe i 'll tell you one
a salmon as she swam unto the sea
met with a dog fish who encounters her with this rough language 'why art thou so bold to mix thyself with our high state of floods being no eminent courtier but one that for the calmest and fresh time o' th' year dost live in shallow rivers rank'st thyself with silly smelts and shrimps
and darest thou pass by our dog ship without reverence
' quoth the salmon 'sister be at peace thank jupiter we both have pass'd the net
our value never can be truly known till in the fisher's basket we be shown th' market then my price may be the higher even when i am nearest to the cook and fire
' so to great men the moral may be stretched men oft are valu'd high when they're most wretched
but come whither you please
i am arm'd 'gainst misery bent to all sways of the oppressor's will there 's no deep valley but near some great hill
act scene i enter and how doth our sister duchess bear herself in her imprisonment
nobly i 'll describe her
she 's sad as one long us'd to 't and she seems rather to welcome the end of misery than shun it a behaviour so noble as gives a majesty to adversity you may discern the shape of loveliness more perfect in her tears than in her smiles she will muse for hours together and her silence methinks expresseth more than if she spake
her melancholy seems to be fortified with a strange disdain
'tis so and this restraint like english mastives that grow fierce with tying makes her too passionately apprehend those pleasures she is kept from
i will no longer study in the book of another's heart
inform her what i told you
enter and attendants all comfort to your grace
i will have none
pray thee why dost thou wrap thy poison'd pills in gold and sugar
your elder brother the lord ferdinand is come to visit you and sends you word 'cause once he rashly made a solemn vow never to see you more he comes i' th' night and prays you gently neither torch nor taper shine in your chamber
he will kiss your hand and reconcile himself but for his vow he dares not see you
take hence the lights
exeunt attendants with lights
enter where are you
this darkness suits you well
i would ask you pardon
you have it for i account it the honorabl'st revenge where i may kill to pardon
where are your cubs
call them your children for though our national law distinguish bastards from true legitimate issue compassionate nature makes them all equal
do you visit me for this
you violate a sacrament o' th' church shall make you howl in hell for 't
it had been well could you have liv'd thus always for indeed you were too much i' th' light but no more i come to seal my peace with you
here 's a hand gives her a dead man's hand
to which you have vow'd much love the ring upon 't you gave
i affectionately kiss it
pray do and bury the print of it in your heart
i will leave this ring with you for a love token and the hand as sure as the ring and do not doubt but you shall have the heart too
when you need a friend send it to him that ow'd it you shall see whether he can aid you
you are very cold i fear you are not well after your travel
let her have lights enough
what witchcraft doth he practise that he hath left a dead man's hand here
here is discovered behind a traverse the artificial figures of and his children appearing as if they were dead
look you here 's the piece from which 'twas ta'en
he doth present you this sad spectacle that now you know directly they are dead hereafter you may wisely cease to grieve for that which cannot be recovered
there is not between heaven and earth one wish i stay for after this
it wastes me more than were 't my picture fashion'd out of wax stuck with a magical needle and then buried in some foul dunghill and yon 's an excellent property for a tyrant which i would account mercy
if they would bind me to that lifeless trunk and let me freeze to death
come you must live
that 's the greatest torture souls feel in hell in hell that they must live and cannot die
portia i 'll new kindle thy coals again and revive the rare and almost dead example of a loving wife
remember you are a christian
the church enjoins fasting i 'll starve myself to death
leave this vain sorrow
things being at the worst begin to mend the bee when he hath shot his sting into your hand may then play with your eye lid
good comfortable fellow persuade a wretch that 's broke upon the wheel to have all his bones new set entreat him live to be executed again
who must despatch me
i account this world a tedious theatre for i do play a part in 't 'gainst my will
come be of comfort i will save your life
indeed i have not leisure to tend so small a business
now by my life i pity you
thou art a fool then to waste thy pity on a thing so wretched as cannot pity itself
i am full of daggers
puff let me blow these vipers from me
enter servant what are you
one that wishes you long life
i would thou wert hang'd for the horrible curse thou hast given me i shall shortly grow one of the miracles of pity
i 'll go pray exit servant
no i 'll go curse
i could curse the stars
and those three smiling seasons of the year into a russian winter nay the world to its first chaos
look you the stars shine still
o but you must remember my curse hath a great way to go
plagues that make lanes through largest families consume them
let them like tyrants never be remembered but for the ill they have done let all the zealous prayers of mortified churchmen forget them
let heaven a little while cease crowning martyrs to punish them
go howl them this and say i long to bleed it is some mercy when men kill with speed
re enter excellent as i would wish she 's plagu'd in art
these presentations are but fram'd in wax by the curious master in that quality vincentio lauriola and she takes them for true substantial bodies
why do you do this
to bring her to despair
faith end here and go no farther in your cruelty send her a penitential garment to put on next to her delicate skin and furnish her with beads and prayer books
that body of hers
while that my blood run pure in 't was more worth than that which thou wouldst comfort call'd a soul
i will send her masques of common courtezans have her meat serv'd up by bawds and ruffians and 'cause she 'll needs be mad i am resolv'd to move forth the common hospital all the mad folk and place them near her lodging there let them practise together sing and dance and act their gambols to the full o' th' moon if she can sleep the better for it let her
your work is almost ended
must i see her again
never in mine own shape that 's forfeited by my intelligence and this last cruel lie when you send me next the business shall be comfort
very likely thy pity is nothing of kin to thee antonio lurks about milan thou shalt shortly thither to feed a fire as great as my revenge which nev'r will slack till it hath spent his fuel intemperate agues make physicians cruel
scene enter and what hideous noise was that
'tis the wild consort of madmen lady which your tyrant brother hath plac'd about your lodging
this tyranny i think was never practis'd till this hour
indeed i thank him
nothing but noise and folly can keep me in my right wits whereas reason and silence make me stark mad
sit down discourse to me some dismal tragedy
o 'twill increase your melancholy
thou art deceiv'd to hear of greater grief would lessen mine
this is a prison
yes but you shall live to shake this durance off
thou art a fool the robin red breast and the nightingale never live long in cages
pray dry your eyes
what think you of madam
of nothing when i muse thus i sleep
like a madman with your eyes open
dost thou think we shall know one another in th' other world
yes out of question
o that it were possible we might but hold some two days' conference with the dead
from them i should learn somewhat i am sure i never shall know here
i 'll tell thee a miracle i am not mad yet to my cause of sorrow th' heaven o'er my head seems made of molten brass the earth of flaming sulphur yet i am not mad
i am acquainted with sad misery as the tann'd galley slave is with his oar necessity makes me suffer constantly and custom makes it easy
who do i look like now
like to your picture in the gallery a deal of life in show but none in practice or rather like some reverend monument whose ruins are even pitied
very proper and fortune seems only to have her eye sight to behold my tragedy
what noise is that
enter servant i am come to tell you your brother hath intended you some sport
a great physician when the pope was sick of a deep melancholy presented him with several sorts of madmen which wild object being full of change and sport forc'd him to laugh and so the imposthume broke the self same cure the duke intends on you
let them come in
there 's a mad lawyer and a secular priest a doctor that hath forfeited his wits by jealousy an astrologian that in his works said such a day o' the month should be the day of doom and failing of 't ran mad an english tailor craz'd i' the brain with the study of new fashions a gentleman usher quite beside himself with care to keep in mind the number of his lady's salutations or 'how do you' she employ'd him in each morning a farmer too an excellent knave in grain mad 'cause he was hind'red transportation and let one broker that 's mad loose to these you'd think the devil were among them
let them loose when you please for i am chain'd to endure all your tyranny
enter madman here by a madman this song is sung to a dismal kind of music o let us howl some heavy note some deadly dogged howl sounding as from the threatening throat of beasts and fatal fowl
as ravens screech owls bulls and bears we 'll bell and bawl our parts till irksome noise have cloy'd your ears and corrosiv'd your hearts
at last whenas our choir wants breath our bodies being blest we 'll sing like swans to welcome death and die in love and rest
doom's day not come yet
i 'll draw it nearer by a perspective or make a glass that shall set all the world on fire upon an instant
i cannot sleep my pillow is stuffed with a litter of porcupines
hell is a mere glass house where the devils are continually blowing up women's souls on hollow irons and the fire never goes out
i have skill in heraldry
you do give for your crest a woodcock's head with the brains picked out on 't you are a very ancient gentleman
greek is turned turk we are only to be saved by the helvetian translation
come on sir i will lay the law to you
o rather lay a corrosive the law will eat to the bone
he that drinks but to satisfy nature is damn'd
if i had my glass here i would show a sight should make all the women here call me mad doctor
no no no a snuffling knave that while he shows the tombs will have his hand in a wench's placket
woe to the caroche that brought home my wife from the masque at three o'clock in the morning
it had a large feather bed in it
i have pared the devil's nails forty times roasted them in raven's eggs and cured agues with them
get me three hundred milch bats to make possets to procure sleep
all the college may throw their caps at me i have made a soap boiler costive it was my masterpiece
here the dance consisting of eight madmen with music answerable thereunto after which like an old man enters
is he mad too
i 'll leave you
exeunt servant and madmen
i am come to make thy tomb
thou speak'st as if i lay upon my death bed gasping for breath
dost thou perceive me sick
yes and the more dangerously since thy sickness is insensible
thou art not mad sure dost know me
who am thou art a box of worm seed at best but a salvatory of green mummy
what 's this flesh
a little crudded milk fantastical puff paste
our bodies are weaker than those paper prisons boys use to keep flies in more contemptible since ours is to preserve earth worms
didst thou ever see a lark in a cage
such is the soul in the body this world is like her little turf of grass and the heaven o'er our heads like her looking glass only gives us a miserable knowledge of the small compass of our prison
am not i thy duchess
thou art some great woman sure for riot begins to sit on thy forehead clad in gray hairs twenty years sooner than on a merry milk maid's
thou sleepest worse than if a mouse should be forced to take up her lodging in a cat's ear a little infant that breeds its teeth should it lie with thee would cry out as if thou wert the more unquiet bedfellow
i am duchess of malfi still
that makes thy sleep so broken glories like glow worms afar off shine bright but look'd to near have neither heat nor light
thou art very plain
my trade is to flatter the dead not the living i am a tomb maker
and thou comest to make my tomb
let me be a little merry of what stuff wilt thou make it
nay resolve me first of what fashion
why do we grow fantastical on our deathbed
do we affect fashion in the grave
princes' images on their tombs do not lie as they were wont seeming to pray up to heaven but with their hands under their cheeks as if they died of the tooth ache
they are not carved with their eyes fix'd upon the stars but as their minds were wholly bent upon the world the selfsame way they seem to turn their faces
let me know fully therefore the effect of this thy dismal preparation this talk fit for a charnel
now i shall enter executioners with a coffin cords and a bell here is a present from your princely brothers and may it arrive welcome for it brings last benefit last sorrow
let me see it i have so much obedience in my blood i wish it in their veins to do them good
this is your last presence chamber
o my sweet lady
peace it affrights not me
i am the common bellman that usually is sent to condemn'd persons the night before they suffer
even now thou said'st thou wast a tomb maker
'twas to bring you by degrees to mortification
hark now everything is still the screech owl and the whistler shrill call upon our dame aloud and bid her quickly don her shroud
much you had of land and rent your length in clay 's now competent a long war disturb'd your mind here your perfect peace is sign'd
of what is 't fools make such vain keeping
sin their conception their birth weeping their life a general mist of error their death a hideous storm of terror
strew your hair with powders sweet don clean linen bathe your feet and the foul fiend more to check a crucifix let bless your neck
'tis now full tide 'tween night and day end your groan and come away
hence villains tyrants murderers
what will you do with my lady
to our next neighbours
they are mad folks
in my last will i have not much to give a many hungry guests have fed upon me thine will be a poor reversion
i will die with her
i pray thee look thou giv'st my little boy some syrup for his cold and let the girl say her prayers ere she sleep
cariola is forced out by the executioners
now what you please what death
strangling here are your executioners
i forgive them the apoplexy catarrh or cough o' th' lungs would do as much as they do
doth not death fright you
who would be afraid on 't knowing to meet such excellent company in th' other world
yet methinks the manner of your death should much afflict you this cord should terrify you
not a whit what would it pleasure me to have my throat cut with diamonds
or to be smothered with cassia
or to be shot to death with pearls
i know death hath ten thousand several doors for men to take their exits and 'tis found they go on such strange geometrical hinges you may open them both ways any way for heaven sake so i were out of your whispering
tell my brothers that i perceive death now i am well awake best gift is they can give or i can take
i would fain put off my last woman's fault i 'd not be tedious to you
dispose my breath how please you but my body bestow upon my women will you
pull and pull strongly for your able strength must pull down heaven upon me yet stay heaven gates are not so highly arch'd as princes' palaces they that enter there must go upon their knees kneels
come violent death serve for mandragora to make me sleep
go tell my brothers when i am laid out they then may feed in quiet
where 's the waiting woman
fetch her some other strangle the children
enter look you there sleeps your mistress
o you are damn'd perpetually for this
my turn is next is 't not so ordered
yes and i am glad you are so well prepar'd for 't
you are deceiv'd sir i am not prepar'd for 't i will not die i will first come to my answer and know how i have offended
you kept her counsel now you shall keep ours
i will not die i must not i am contracted to a young gentleman
here 's your wedding ring
let me but speak with the duke
i 'll discover treason to his person
she bites and scratches
if you kill me now i am damn'd i have not been at confession this two years
i am quick with child
why then your credit 's saved
bear her into the next room let these lie still
exeunt the executioners with the body of enter is she dead
she is what you 'd have her
but here begin your pity shows the children strangled
alas how have these offended
the death of young wolves is never to be pitied
fix your eye here
do you not weep
other sins only speak murder shrieks out
the element of water moistens the earth but blood flies upwards and bedews the heavens
cover her face mine eyes dazzle she died young
i think not so her infelicity seem'd to have years too many
she and i were twins and should i die this instant i had liv'd her time to a minute
it seems she was born first you have bloodily approv'd the ancient truth that kindred commonly do worse agree than remote strangers
let me see her face again
why didst thou not pity her
what an excellent honest man mightst thou have been if thou hadst borne her to some sanctuary
or bold in a good cause oppos'd thyself with thy advanced sword above thy head between her innocence and my revenge
i bade thee when i was distracted of my wits go kill my dearest friend and thou hast done 't
for let me but examine well the cause what was the meanness of her match to me
only i must confess i had a hope had she continu'd widow to have gain'd an infinite mass of treasure by her death and that was the main cause her marriage that drew a stream of gall quite through my heart
for thee as we observe in tragedies that a good actor many times is curs'd for playing a villain's part i hate thee for 't and for my sake say thou hast done much ill well
let me quicken your memory for i perceive you are falling into ingratitude i challenge the reward due to my service
i 'll tell thee what i 'll give thee
i 'll give thee a pardon for this murder
yes and 'tis the largest bounty i can study to do thee
by what authority didst thou execute this bloody sentence
was i her judge
did any ceremonial form of law doom her to not being
did a complete jury deliver her conviction up i' the court
where shalt thou find this judgment register'd unless in hell
see like a bloody fool thou 'st forfeited thy life and thou shalt die for 't
the office of justice is perverted quite when one thief hangs another
who shall dare to reveal this
o i 'll tell thee the wolf shall find her grave and scrape it up not to devour the corpse but to discover the horrid murder
you not i shall quake for 't
i will first receive my pension
you are a villain
when your ingratitude is judge i am so
o horror that not the fear of him which binds the devils can prescribe man obedience
never look upon me more
why fare thee well
your brother and yourself are worthy men
you have a pair of hearts are hollow graves rotten and rotting others and your vengeance like two chain'd bullets still goes arm in arm you may be brothers for treason like the plague doth take much in a blood
i stand like one that long hath ta'en a sweet and golden dream i am angry with myself now that i wake
get thee into some unknown part o' the world that i may never see thee
let me know wherefore i should be thus neglected
sir i serv'd your tyranny and rather strove to satisfy yourself than all the world and though i loath'd the evil yet i lov'd you that did counsel it and rather sought to appear a true servant than an honest man
i 'll go hunt the badger by owl light 'tis a deed of darkness
he 's much distracted
off my painted honour
while with vain hopes our faculties we tire we seem to sweat in ice and freeze in fire
what would i do were this to do again
i would not change my peace of conscience for all the wealth of europe
she stirs here 's life return fair soul from darkness and lead mine out of this sensible hell she 's warm she breathes upon thy pale lips i will melt my heart to store them with fresh colour
i dare not call so pity would destroy pity
her eye opes and heaven in it seems to ope that late was shut to take me up to mercy
yes madam he is living the dead bodies you saw were but feign'd statues
he 's reconcil'd to your brothers the pope hath wrought the atonement
o she 's gone again
there the cords of life broke
o sacred innocence that sweetly sleeps on turtles' feathers whilst a guilty conscience is a black register wherein is writ all our good deeds and bad a perspective that shows us hell
that we cannot be suffer'd to do good when we have a mind to it
this is manly sorrow these tears i am very certain never grew in my mother's milk
my estate is sunk below the degree of fear where were these penitent fountains while she was living
o they were frozen up
here is a sight as direful to my soul as is the sword unto a wretch hath slain his father
come i 'll bear thee hence and execute thy last will that 's deliver thy body to the reverend dispose of some good women that the cruel tyrant shall not deny me
then i 'll post to milan where somewhat i will speedily enact worth my dejection
exit with the body
act v scene i enter and what think you of my hope of reconcilement to the arragonian brethren
i misdoubt it for though they have sent their letters of safe conduct for your repair to milan they appear but nets to entrap you
the marquis of pescara under whom you hold certain land in cheat much 'gainst his noble nature hath been mov'd to seize those lands and some of his dependants are at this instant making it their suit to be invested in your revenues
i cannot think they mean well to your life that do deprive you of your means of life your living
you are still an heretic to any safety i can shape myself
here comes the marquis i will make myself petitioner for some part of your land to know whither it is flying
enter sir i have a suit to you
an easy one there is the citadel of saint bennet with some demesnes of late in the possession of antonio bologna please you bestow them on me
you are my friend but this is such a suit nor fit for me to give nor you to take
i will give you ample reason for 't soon in private here 's the cardinal's mistress
enter my lord i am grown your poor petitioner and should be an ill beggar had i not a great man's letter here the cardinal's to court you in my favour
he entreats for you the citadel of saint bennet that belong'd to the banish'd bologna
i could not have thought of a friend i could rather pleasure with it 'tis yours
sir i thank you and he shall know how doubly i am engag'd both in your gift and speediness of giving which makes your grant the greater
how they fortify themselves with my ruin
sir i am little bound to you
because you deni'd this suit to me and gave 't to such a creature
do you know what it was
it was antonio's land not forfeited by course of law but ravish'd from his throat by the cardinal's entreaty
it were not fit i should bestow so main a piece of wrong upon my friend 'tis a gratification only due to a strumpet for it is injustice
shall i sprinkle the pure blood of innocents to make those followers i call my friends look ruddier upon me
i am glad this land ta'en from the owner by such wrong returns again unto so foul an use as salary for his lust
learn good delio to ask noble things of me and you shall find i 'll be a noble giver
you instruct me well
why here 's a man now would fright impudence from sauciest beggars
prince ferdinand 's come to milan sick as they give out of an apoplexy but some say 'tis a frenzy i am going to visit him
'tis a noble old fellow
what course do you mean to take antonio
this night i mean to venture all my fortune which is no more than a poor ling'ring life to the cardinal's worst of malice
i have got private access to his chamber and intend to visit him about the mid of night as once his brother did our noble duchess
it may be that the sudden apprehension of danger for i 'll go in mine own shape when he shall see it fraight with love and duty may draw the poison out of him and work a friendly reconcilement
if it fail yet it shall rid me of this infamous calling for better fall once than be ever falling
i 'll second you in all danger and howe'er my life keeps rank with yours
you are still my lov'd and best friend
scene enter and now doctor may i visit your patient
if 't please your lordship but he 's instantly to take the air here in the gallery by my direction
pray thee what 's his disease
a very pestilent disease my lord they call lycanthropia
i need a dictionary to 't
i 'll tell you
in those that are possess'd with 't there o'erflows such melancholy humour they imagine themselves to be transformed into wolves steal forth to church yards in the dead of night and dig dead bodies up as two nights since one met the duke 'bout midnight in a lane behind saint mark's church with the leg of a man upon his shoulder and he howl'd fearfully said he was a wolf only the difference was a wolf's skin was hairy on the outside his on the inside bade them take their swords rip up his flesh and try
straight i was sent for and having minister'd to him found his grace very well recover'd
i am glad on 't
yet not without some fear of a relapse
if he grow to his fit again i 'll go a nearer way to work with him than ever paracelsus dream'd of if they 'll give me leave i 'll buffet his madness out of him
stand aside he comes
enter and leave me
why doth your lordship love this solitariness
eagles commonly fly alone they are crows daws and starlings that flock together
look what 's that follows me
stay it let it not haunt me
impossible if you move and the sun shine
i will throttle it
throws himself down on his shadow
o my lord you are angry with nothing
you are a fool how is 't possible i should catch my shadow unless i fall upon 't
when i go to hell i mean to carry a bribe for look you good gifts evermore make way for the worst persons
rise good my lord
i am studying the art of patience
'tis a noble virtue
to drive six snails before me from this town to moscow neither use goad nor whip to them but let them take their own time the patient'st man i' th' world match me for an experiment an i 'll crawl after like a sheep biter
use me well you were best
what i have done i have done i 'll confess nothing
now let me come to him
are you mad my lord
are you out of your princely wits
let me have his beard saw'd off and his eye brows fil'd more civil
i must do mad tricks with him for that 's the only way on 't
i have brought your grace a salamander's skin to keep you from sun burning
i have cruel sore eyes
the white of a cockatrix's egg is present remedy
let it be a new laid one you were best
hide me from him physicians are like kings they brook no contradiction
now he begins to fear me now let me alone with him
put off your gown
let me have some forty urinals filled with rosewater he and i 'll go pelt one another with them
now he begins to fear me
can you fetch a frisk sir
let him go let him go upon my peril i find by his eye he stands in awe of me i 'll make him as tame as a dormouse
can you fetch your frisks sir
i will stamp him into a cullis flay off his skin to cover one of the anatomies this rogue hath set i' th' cold yonder in barber chirurgeon's hall
you are all of you like beasts for sacrifice
throws the down and beats him
there 's nothing left of you but tongue and belly flattery and lechery
doctor he did not fear you thoroughly
true i was somewhat too forward
mercy upon me what a fatal judgment hath fall'n upon this ferdinand
knows your grace what accident hath brought unto the prince this strange distraction
i must feign somewhat
thus they say it grew
you have heard it rumour'd for these many years none of our family dies but there is seen the shape of an old woman which is given by tradition to us to have been murder'd by her nephews for her riches
such a figure one night as the prince sat up late at 's book appear'd to him when crying out for help the gentleman of 's chamber found his grace all on a cold sweat alter'd much in face and language since which apparition he hath grown worse and worse and i much fear he cannot live
sir i would speak with you
we 'll leave your grace wishing to the sick prince our noble lord all health of mind and body
you are most welcome
exeunt and are you come
this fellow must not know by any means i had intelligence in our duchess' death for though i counsell'd it the full of all th' engagement seem'd to grow from ferdinand
now sir how fares our sister
i do not think but sorrow makes her look like to an oft dy'd garment she shall now take comfort from me
why do you look so wildly
o the fortune of your master here the prince dejects you but be you of happy comfort if you 'll do one thing for me i 'll entreat though he had a cold tomb stone o'er his bones i 'd make you what you would be
any thing give it me in a breath and let me fly to 't
they that think long small expedition win for musing much o' th' end cannot begin
enter sir will you come into supper
i am busy leave me
what an excellent shape hath that fellow
antonio lurks here in milan inquire him out and kill him
while he lives our sister cannot marry and i have thought of an excellent match for her
do this and style me thy advancement
but by what means shall i find him out
there is a gentleman call'd delio here in the camp that hath been long approv'd his loyal friend
set eye upon that fellow follow him to mass may be antonio although he do account religion but a school name for fashion of the world may accompany him or else go inquire out delio's confessor and see if you can bribe him to reveal it
there are a thousand ways a man might find to trace him as to know what fellows haunt the jews for taking up great sums of money for sure he 's in want or else to go to the picture makers and learn who bought her picture lately some of these happily may take
well i 'll not freeze i' th' business i would see that wretched thing antonio above all sights i' th' world
do and be happy
this fellow doth breed basilisks in 's eyes he 's nothing else but murder yet he seems not to have notice of the duchess' death
'tis his cunning i must follow his example there cannot be a surer way to trace than that of an old fox
re enter with a pistol so sir you are well met
nay the doors are fast enough now sir i will make you confess your treachery
yes confess to me which of my women 'twas you hir'd to put love powder into my drink
yes when i was at malfi
why should i fall in love with such a face else
i have already suffer'd for thee so much pain the only remedy to do me good is to kill my longing
sure your pistol holds nothing but perfumes or kissing comfits
you have a pretty way on 't to discover your longing
come come i 'll disarm you and arm you thus yet this is wondrous strange
compare thy form and my eyes together you 'll find my love no such great miracle
now you 'll say i am wanton this nice modesty in ladies is but a troublesome familiar that haunts them
know you me i am a blunt soldier
the better sure there wants fire where there are no lively sparks of roughness
and i want compliment
why ignorance in courtship cannot make you do amiss if you have a heart to do well
you are very fair
nay if you lay beauty to my charge i must plead unguilty
your bright eyes carry a quiver of darts in them sharper than sun beams
you will mar me with commendation put yourself to the charge of courting me whereas now i woo you
i have it i will work upon this creature
let us grow most amorously familiar if the great cardinal now should see me thus would he not count me a villain
no he might count me a wanton not lay a scruple of offence on you for if i see and steal a diamond the fault is not i' th' stone but in me the thief that purloins it
i am sudden with you
we that are great women of pleasure use to cut off these uncertain wishes and unquiet longings and in an instant join the sweet delight and the pretty excuse together
had you been i' th' street under my chamber window even there i should have courted you
o you are an excellent lady
bid me do somewhat for you presently to express i love you
i will and if you love me fail not to effect it
the cardinal is grown wondrous melancholy demand the cause let him not put you off with feign'd excuse discover the main ground on 't
why would you know this
i have depended on him and i hear that he is fall'n in some disgrace with the emperor if he be like the mice that forsake falling houses i would shift to other dependance
you shall not need follow the wars i 'll be your maintenance
and i your loyal servant but i cannot leave my calling
not leave an ungrateful general for the love of a sweet lady
you are like some cannot sleep in feather beds but must have blocks for their pillows
will you do this
to morrow i 'll expect th' intelligence
get you into my cabinet you shall have it with you
do not delay me no more than i do you i am like one that is condemn'd i have my pardon promis'd but i would see it seal'd
go get you in you shall see my wind my tongue about his heart like a skein of silk
exit re enter where are you
let none upon your lives have conference with the prince ferdinand unless i know it
aside in this distraction he may reveal the murder
yond 's my lingering consumption i am weary of her and by any means would be quit of
how now my lord
o you are much alter'd come i must be your secretary and remove this lead from off your bosom what 's the matter
i may not tell you
are you so far in love with sorrow you cannot part with part of it
or think you i cannot love your grace when you are sad as well as merry
or do you suspect i that have been a secret to your heart these many winters cannot be the same unto your tongue
satisfy thy longing the only way to make thee keep my counsel is not to tell thee
tell your echo this or flatterers that like echoes still report what they hear though most imperfect and not me for if that you be true unto yourself i 'll know
will you rack me
no judgment shall draw it from you it is an equal fault to tell one's secrets unto all or none
the first argues folly
but the last tyranny
very well why imagine i have committed some secret deed which i desire the world may never hear of
therefore may not i know it
you have conceal'd for me as great a sin as adultery
sir never was occasion for perfect trial of my constancy till now sir i beseech you you 'll repent it
it hurries thee to ruin i 'll not tell thee
be well advis'd and think what danger 'tis to receive a prince's secrets
they that do had need have their breasts hoop'd with adamant to contain them
i pray thee yet be satisfi'd examine thine own frailty 'tis more easy to tie knots than unloose them
'tis a secret that like a ling'ring poison may chance lie spread in thy veins and kill thee seven year hence
now you dally with me
no more thou shalt know it
by my appointment the great duchess of malfi and two of her young children four nights since were strangl'd
sir what have you done
think you your bosom will be a grave dark and obscure enough for such a secret
you have undone yourself sir
it lies not in me to conceal it
come i will swear you to 't upon this book
she kisses the book
now you shall never utter it thy curiosity hath undone thee thou 'rt poison'd with that book
because i knew thou couldst not keep my counsel i have bound thee to 't by death
re enter for pity sake hold
i forgive you this equal piece of justice you have done for i betray'd your counsel to that fellow
he over heard it that was the cause i said it lay not in me to conceal it
o foolish woman couldst not thou have poison'd him
'tis weakness too much to think what should have been done
i go i know not whither
wherefore com'st thou hither
that i might find a great man like yourself not out of his wits as the lord ferdinand to remember my service
i 'll have thee hew'd in pieces
make not yourself such a promise of that life which is not yours to dispose of
who plac'd thee here
her lust as she intended
very well now you know me for your fellow murderer
and wherefore should you lay fair marble colours upon your rotten purposes to me
unless you imitate some that do plot great treasons and when they have done go hide themselves i' th' grave of those were actors in 't
no more there is a fortune attends thee
shall i go sue to fortune any longer
'tis the fool's pilgrimage
i have honours in store for thee
there are a many ways that conduct to seeming honour and some of them very dirty ones
throw to the devil thy melancholy
the fire burns well what need we keep a stirring of 't and make a greater smother
thou wilt kill antonio
take up that body
i think i shall shortly grow the common bier for church yards
i will allow thee some dozen of attendants to aid thee in the murder
o by no means
physicians that apply horse leeches to any rank swelling use to cut off their tails that the blood may run through them the faster let me have no train when i go to shed blood less it make me have a greater when i ride to the gallows
come to me after midnight to help to remove that body to her own lodging
i 'll give out she died o' th' plague 'twill breed the less inquiry after her death
where 's castruccio her husband
he 's rode to naples to take possession of antonio's citadel
believe me you have done a very happy turn
fail not to come
there is the master key of our lodgings and by that you may conceive what trust i plant in you
you shall find me ready
exit o poor antonio though nothing be so needful to thy estate as pity yet i find nothing so dangerous
i must look to my footing in such slippery ice pavements men had need to be frost nail'd well they may break their necks else the precedent 's here afore me
how this man bears up in blood
why 'tis well security some men call the suburbs of hell only a dead wall between
well good antonio i 'll seek thee out and all my care shall be to put thee into safety from the reach of these most cruel biters that have got some of thy blood already
it may be i 'll join with thee in a most just revenge
the weakest arm is strong enough that strikes with the sword of justice
still methinks the duchess haunts me there there
'tis nothing but my melancholy
o penitence let me truly taste thy cup that throws men down only to raise them up
scene enter and echo from the grave yond 's the cardinal's window
this fortification grew from the ruins of an ancient abbey and to yond side o' th' river lies a wall piece of a cloister which in my opinion gives the best echo that you ever heard so hollow and so dismal and withal so plain in the distinction of our words that many have suppos'd it is a spirit that answers
i do love these ancient ruins
we never tread upon them but we set our foot upon some reverend history and questionless here in this open court which now lies naked to the injuries of stormy weather some men lie interr'd lov'd the church so well and gave so largely to 't they thought it should have canopied their bones till dooms day
but all things have their end churches and cities which have diseases like to men must have like death that we have
like death that we have
now the echo hath caught you
it groan'd methought and gave a very deadly accent
i told you 'twas a pretty one
you may make it a huntsman or a falconer a musician or a thing of sorrow
a thing of sorrow
ay sure that suits it best
that suits it best
'tis very like my wife's voice
come let us walk further from t
i would not have you go to the cardinal's to night do not
wisdom doth not more moderate wasting sorrow than time
take time for 't be mindful of thy safety
be mindful of thy safety
make scrutiny through the passages of your own life you 'll find it impossible to fly your fate
o fly your fate
the dead stones seem to have pity on you and give you good counsel
echo i will not talk with thee for thou art a dead thing
thou art a dead thing
my duchess is asleep now and her little ones i hope sweetly
o heaven shall i never see her more
never see her more
i mark'd not one repetition of the echo but that and on the sudden a clear light presented me a face folded in sorrow
come i 'll be out of this ague for to live thus is not indeed to live it is a mockery and abuse of life
i will not henceforth save myself by halves lose all or nothing
your own virtue save you
i 'll fetch your eldest son and second you
it may be that the sight of his own blood spread in so sweet a figure may beget the more compassion
however fare you well
though in our miseries fortune have a part yet in our noble sufferings she hath none
contempt of pain that we may call our own
scene enter and you shall not watch to night by the sick prince his grace is very well recover'd
good my lord suffer us
o by no means the noise and change of object in his eye doth more distract him
i pray all to bed and though you hear him in his violent fit do not rise i entreat you
so sir we shall not
nay i must have you promise upon your honours for i was enjoin'd to 't by himself and he seem'd to urge it sensibly
let our honours bind this trifle
nor any of your followers
it may be to make trial of your promise when he 's asleep myself will rise and feign some of his mad tricks and cry out for help and feign myself in danger
if your throat were cutting i 'd not come at you now i have protested against it
why i thank you
'twas a foul storm to night
the lord ferdinand's chamber shook like an osier
'twas nothing put pure kindness in the devil to rock his own child
exeunt all except the the reason why i would not suffer these about my brother is because at midnight i may with better privacy convey julia's body to her own lodging
i would pray now but the devil takes away my heart for having any confidence in prayer
about this hour i appointed bosola to fetch the body
when he hath serv'd my turn he dies
'twas the cardinal's voice i heard him name bosola and my death
listen i hear one's footing
enter strangling is a very quiet death
nay then i see i must stand upon my guard
what say to that
whisper softly do you agree to 't
so it must be done i' th' dark the cardinal would not for a thousand pounds the doctor should see it
my death is plotted here 's the consequence of murder
we value not desert nor christian breath when we know black deeds must be cur'd with death
enter and servant here stay sir and be confident i pray i 'll fetch you a dark lantern
could i take him at his prayers there were hope of pardon
fall right my sword
i 'll not give thee so much leisure as to pray
o i am gone
thou hast ended a long suit in a minute
a most wretched thing that only have thy benefit in death to appear myself
re enter servant with a lantern where are you sir
very near my home
smother thy pity thou art dead else
the man i would have sav'd 'bove mine own life
we are merely the stars' tennis balls struck and banded which way please them
o good antonio i 'll whisper one thing in thy dying ear shall make thy heart break quickly
thy fair duchess and two sweet children their very names kindle a little life in me
some men have wish'd to die at the hearing of sad tidings i am glad that i shall do 't in sadness
i would not now wish my wounds balm'd nor heal'd for i have no use to put my life to
in all our quest of greatness like wanton boys whose pastime is their care we follow after bubbles blown in th' air
pleasure of life what is 't
only the good hours of an ague merely a preparative to rest to endure vexation
i do not ask the process of my death only commend me to delio
and let my son fly the courts to princes
thou seem'st to have lov'd antonio
i brought him hither to have reconcil'd him to the cardinal
i do not ask thee that
take him up if thou tender thine own life and bear him where the lady julia was wont to lodge
o my fate moves swift
i have this cardinal in the forge already now i 'll bring him to th' hammer
i will not imitate things glorious
no more than base i 'll be mine own example
on on and look thou represent for silence the thing thou bear'st
scene v enter with a book i am puzzl'd in a question about hell he says in hell there 's one material fire and yet it shall not burn all men alike
how tedious is a guilty conscience
when i look into the fish ponds in my garden methinks i see a thing arm'd with a rake that seems to strike at me
enter and servant bearing body now art thou come
thou look'st ghastly there sits in thy face some great determination mix'd with some fear
thus it lightens into action i am come to kill thee
thou art deceiv'd they are out of thy howling
hold and i will faithfully divide revenues with thee
thy prayers and proffers are both unseasonable
i have confin'd your flight i 'll suffer your retreat to julia's chamber but no further
enter above and listen
my dukedom for rescue
fie upon his counterfeiting
why 'tis not the cardinal
yes yes 'tis he but i 'll see him hang'd ere i 'll go down to him
here 's a plot upon me i am assaulted
i am lost unless some rescue
he doth this pretty well but it will not serve to laugh me out of mine honour
the sword's at my throat
you would not bawl so loud then
come come let 's go to bed he told us this much aforehand
he wish'd you should not come at him but believe 't the accent of the voice sounds not in jest i 'll down to him howsoever and with engines force ope the doors
let 's follow him aloof and note how the cardinal will laugh at him
exeunt above and there 's for you first 'cause you shall not unbarricade the door to let in rescue
what cause hast thou to pursue my life
slain by my hand unwittingly
pray and be sudden
when thou kill'd'st thy sister thou took'st from justice her most equal balance and left her naught but her sword
now it seems thy greatness was only outward for thou fall'st faster of thyself than calamity can drive thee
i 'll not waste longer time there
thou hast hurt me
shall i die like a leveret without any resistance
give me a fresh horse rally the vaunt guard or the day is lost yield yield
i give you the honour of arms shake my sword over you will you yield
help me i am your brother
my brother fight upon the adverse party
he wounds the and in the scuffle gives his death wound
there flies your ransom
i suffer now for what hath former bin sorrow is held the eldest child of sin
now you 're brave fellows
caesar's fortune was harder than pompey's caesar died in the arms of prosperity pompey at the feet of disgrace
you both died in the field
the pain 's nothing pain many times is taken away with the apprehension of greater as the tooth ache with the sight of a barber that comes to pull it out
there 's philosophy for you
now my revenge is perfect
sink thou main cause kills of my undoing
the last part of my life hath done me best service
give me some wet hay i am broken winded
i do account this world but a dog kennel i will vault credit and affect high pleasures beyond death
he seems to come to himself now he 's so near the bottom
my sister o my sister
there 's the cause on 't
whether we fall by ambition blood or lust like diamonds we are cut with our own dust
thou hast thy payment too
yes i hold my weary soul in my teeth 'tis ready to part from me
i do glory that thou which stood'st like a huge pyramid begun upon a large and ample base shalt end in a little point a kind of nothing
enter below and how now my lord
revenge for the duchess of malfi murdered by the arragonian brethren for antonio slain by this hand for lustful julia poison'd by this man and lastly for myself that was an actor in the main of all much 'gainst mine own good nature yet i' the end neglected
how now my lord
look to my brother he gave us these large wounds as we were struggling here i' th' rushes
and now i pray let me be laid by and never thought of
how fatally it seems he did withstand his own rescue
thou wretched thing of blood how came antonio by his death
in a mist i know not how such a mistake as i have often seen in a play
o i am gone
we are only like dead walls or vaulted graves that ruin'd yield no echo
it may be pain but no harm to me to die in so good a quarrel
o this gloomy world
in what a shadow or deep pit of darkness doth womanish and fearful mankind live
let worthy minds ne'er stagger in distrust to suffer death or shame for what is just mine is another voyage
the noble delio as i came to th' palace told me of antonio's being here and show'd me a pretty gentleman his son and heir
enter and son o sir you come too late
i heard so and was arm'd for 't ere i came
let us make noble use of this great ruin and join all our force to establish this young hopeful gentleman in 's mother's right
these wretched eminent things leave no more fame behind 'em than should one fall in a frost and leave his print in snow as soon as the sun shines it ever melts both form and matter
i have ever thought nature doth nothing so great for great men as when she 's pleas'd to make them lords of truth integrity of life is fame's best friend which nobly beyond death shall crown the end
