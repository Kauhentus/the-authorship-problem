tragical history of i enter time that is past the muses now recalls forcing my fleeting presence to retire and pitch my feet upon the english shore i had almost drown'd in black oblivion an honour'd history of an english knight as famous once for deeds of chivalry as any of the worthies of the world renowned sir guy of warwick whose great name makes england famous in all after times for nursing up so brave a martiallist
time now renues his fortines to the world and layes them open to your gentle views think then with apprehensive eyes yo see this warlike lord boldly attempt to fight with that fell sauage bore of calledon that spoiles the fields and murders passengers him hath his sword subdu'd and now again he combates with that huge and monstrous beast call'd the wild cow of dunsmore heath all for the love of phillis he performs for phillis love old rohons only child what will not guy of warwick dare to do
and having done those things that she enjoyn'd he reaps the harvest of her happy love and at the length enjoyes her for his wife
to grace this bridal feast imagine then king athelstone hath left fair winchester and here in warwick castle keeps his court
vvhat follows now of guy and his fair deeds sit and behold the story now proceeds

seven years to win thy love this sword of mine hath beat down monsters and subdued strong knights seven years to win thy love this breast of mine hath bin oppos'd even against the face of death but for my god who gave me power and strength to doe these wonders in the sight of man hath guy of warwicke yet no service done the thought of which torments my inward soul and breaks my heart untill i have redeem'd my great neglect of service to my god for which to him alone i have made a vow never to lie by my fair phillis side to eat to drink nor rest long in one place till i have seen my saviours sepulchre within the walls of fair jerusalem and with my sword for my redeemers sake beat back those misbelieving saracens that seek the ruine of that holy place making them leave deluding mahomet and trust upon the blessed name of christ
all this hath warwicke sworn to undertake or loose his life for his redeemers sake
o do not bid me stay and ask me what thou wilt i must away
see the rich burthen of my youthful womb the hopeful issue of thy happy love let that yet move thee dear lord do not go lest both of us do pine with grief and woe

my hearts so sad i know not what to say god grant thy grave be not that gown of gray my much misdoubting heart sayes i shall see my high loved lord laid low in misery
do not presage dear love but here me speak i charge thee on that love thou bearst to me never to reveal to father friend no nor the king himself what i intend nor whither i am gone until a month be past and i hence free for pursuit of my friends will follow me
do this and phillis love will brightly shine and guy return with joy from palestine
i must i will even do what you please your will shall be fulfilled yet ere you go this pledge of my true love i will bestow upon thy hand i put my marriage ring if ere i see the same and thou not by phillis will grieving weep and weeping die

enter sultan shamurath soldan of babylon with zorastes
thus sultan shamurath as earthly god of kings have marcht along with all their vvarlike troopes
ten thousand gallies ships and brigandines lye dancing on the adratique sea ready to be commanded when we please to bear this captive king of fair jerusalem to our triumphant city babylon but say zorastes how shall we employ our vvarlike forces 'gainst these christians
most dread and mighty emperour of the east whose puissant and warlike force commands even from the orient to the sonnes decline suffer not thus these hated christians to inmure themselves in walls of stone and brasse whilst sultan shamurath with all his lords attends a day of battle with their swords
great king of babell now be rul'd by me and let zorastes counsel now prevail i'le raise up heaps of damned spirits from hell that shall make way unto my bold attempt
legions of divels attend my dreadful charmes ready to be commanded when i please then mighty soldan make no more delay my art shall make the conquerour this day
thankes stout zorastes great magician thanks but first lets summon them unto a parley perhaps they'l yield their city to our hands knowing our force to be invincible and they not able to withstand our power
trumpet or drum summon a parley there
a parley sounded enter the king of jerusalem upon the walls
what craves thasirian emperour at our hands
homage and fealty as thy soveraigne lord of all these spacious bounds of christendome know petty king of fair jerusalem i am the mighty sultan shamurath that rules the tripple city babylon and all the kingdomes of the eastern world only this little part of asia holds out against us and derides our faith scorning our lawes of holy mahomet but by his blessed alcaron i swear i'le ne're depart nor draw my army hence till in the temples of jerusalem both mahomet asteroth and termagaunt those holy gods that governs babylon be set for you stout christians to adore which ye shall do or all of you shall die and basely at our foot like vassals lie
proud and presumptuous tyrant as thou art we fear no bug bear threats of tyranny nor all the multitudes thou canst command we guard and keep the blessed sepulchre of our deare saviour and redeemer christ within the walls of fair jerusalem though on a suddain with your heathen troops you have begirt us with a fearful siege yet know proud syrian that fair zions hill king solomon's temple and the marble tomb which we adore with awfull reverence can raise a hundred thousand christians and proudly beat you back to babylon
thou will not then surrender us thy town
not whilst one man survives to lift a sword attempt the worst you can to save or kill we are prepar'd even against the worst of ill
why then at all march forward warlike lords wee'l parley now with pole axe bills and swords darraigne our battles and begin the fight and mahound still direct my course aright
enter guy of warwick solus
thus through the help of my dear saviour christ whose out strecht arm hath still preserved me i am escap't from sultan shamurath and all his hoast of cursed saracens now i am come where i may fix mine eyes safely upon king david's city walls
is this judeas pride fair zions hill
sanctum sanctorum and the house of heaven the place where my dear saviour lost his life
o how it grieves me to behold thy walls hem'd in with dogs and cursed saracens that seek to rob thee of thy beauty quite and turn thy joyful day to mourning night
but heaven assisting me i will prevent their damned purposes and make them repent their journey taken 'gainst judeas good or in that fair adventure spend my blood
tarry tarry tarry hold hold hold
how now sirrah what's the news with you
o master are you there
i have done such an exploit as you never heard of in your life
nay i am sure it passes your capacity but i'le tell you though for it was a valiant piece of service when i saw you got in amongst the pogons i thought some body had hired you to break heads by the dozen for you never hit any of them but they shak't their heels as though they had the palsey i seeing you so hard at work thought it not best to trouble ye but after the old manner ran and hid my self in a bush
was this your valiant piece of service
o master you doe not hear half yet i lay so long till you were gone and looking out of the bush i could see all the pogons laid fast asleep then went i sneaking and stole away their snapsacks with all their victuals i got up to the top of a hill and eat it up every bit when i had done i began to hollow the pogans missing their provant came running after me but i made one pair of leggs worth two pair of hands and out run them all ifaith
i thought what hot service you doe alwaies but peace here comes the king of fair jerusalem
enter the king of jerusalem
i am a wretched king the more my wo kings are sometimes distrest and i am so but if thou be that warlike conquerour that through the pagan hoast hath cut thy way i do beseech thee even with woful tears to save judea sion palestine from base attempt of heathen servitude
o scurvy if it be
why i'le tell you good∣man king twas i and my master tickled 'um ifaith
true sir you and your master and i pray what did you
when you had kil'd them i came and cut off their heads
where wert thou born
or whats thy countries name brave christian knight may i be bold to ask
my native countrey is fair england cal'd my name sir guy of warwick hither come of holy zeal to see my saviours tomb but seeing it hem'd round about with foes i cut a passage with my warlike sword meaning to rescue it or lose my life
heaven prosper thy attempt lead on fair knight god and good angels still protect our right
god and saint george in warwicks quarrel fight
alarum enter sultan zorastes from the fight
o speak zorastes what divel or man is that which in his fury confounds such heaps of men
my lord i cannot tell but this i know neither turk nor saracen can withstand his blow our souldiers fly like chaff before the wind and none can stand against his conquering sword
canst thou not tell me what he is
nor by thy magick charmes confound the slave
i can do both as you shall streight behold bellemoth asteroth ascend
i charge thee tell me truly who it is that in his rage confounds and spoiles our men
'tis guy of warwick that is hither come of holy zeal to see his saviour tomb
but never shall he see that marble grave go bellemoth and in a fierce flame hoyse him aloft into the vacant air and throw him headlong into the neighbouring seas
no we fight my lord for victory is your's
then zorastes once more to the fight and mahomet direct my course aright
enter sultan and zorastes flying guy and they eight zorastes escapeth guy taketh sultan prisoner
then enter the king of jerusalem
command these brawling drums to cease their noise whilst i salute our warlike conquerour renown'd sir guy of warwick whose great name extolls fair england with a glorious fame fit in our throne victorious englishman our crown and scepter shall be all as free to guy of warwick as it is to me
far be it from the thought of englishman to usurp the seat of fair jerusalem but for those favours you have grac't me with here i resigne unto your princely hands great sultan shamurath king of babylon
victorious knight both in thy words and deeds this proud presumptuous king of babylon which thou surrend rest here as prisoner i freely do deliver back to thee to ransome or dispose as thou thinkst best
let me be ransom'd mighty christian knight and i will back surrender to thy hands all those townes and castles i have won joppa samaria and rich nazareth with fifty thousand bars of silver plate to ransome home great sultan shamurath
i scorn thy league and love proud heathen king i'le make thee now my vassals underling
scornst thou to love the monarch of the world
the monarch of black hell should i not scorn the love of belzebub leviathan sultan stamps
nay sir i'le make you tear your mahomet and stamp and stare
enter sparrow with a pagan in a halter
too ifaith afore i have done with him o master you think i can do nothing i have catchta pogon
how sir i pray
why master after the valliantest manner that could be for i found him asleep and having a halter in my pocket put it about his neck instead of a falling band
but what will you do with him now
marry master first and come fordermost i'le hang him two houres by the clock then i'le cut off his head because he shall not call me knave for my labour and when i have done so i'le let him go his way nay ye whorson pogon i'le tickle ye that's flat*
o master the pogon has given me two slips for a tester but i'le after him if i catch him again i'le give him a cawd east in's chaps that's two turns and a wry mouth and then he may drink to his friends all the day after
since that your majesty hath back delivered this sultan shamurath into my hands know the ransome i will set on him shall please our god and all good christians
o blessed emperour think upon the crosse which is the true badg of our sweet saviour christ by whose great help we have got victory
then to enlarge the fame of christendome and our great makers ever glorious name thou sultan shamurath with all thy hoast shall leave your faith and become christians do this from any ransome thou art free and all thy people set at liberty
we yield consent victorious conqueror the god you serve is great omnipotent ruling the day of battle as he please making one hundred kill ten thousand men such were the odds of our battallions therefore for guy of warwicks sake wee'l trust in christ and mahound clean forsake
then fit we honour'd to the marble tomb where you shall have received your christendome you and your lords shall take a solemne oath that all your empery shall do the like come on brave guy for by thy hand is done this everlasting fame to christendome
exeunt king and sultan
go on great kings i'le follow presently and now since all those wars are at an end and that my heavenly maker hath vouchsaft to give me victory against his foes in lowly pilgrimage i vow to come and visit my dear saviours blessed tomb there for an everlasting memory i'le offer up my sword and furniture and here i make a vow in sight of heaven that henceforth i'le never bear armes again but spend the residue of my sinful life in zealous prayers and repentant tears for all the follies of my wretchlesse youth
now glorious god with thy auspicious eye smile on this happy work that's thus began to enlarge the fame of blessed christendome
thus time that in his ceaslesse motion controuls the hearts of kings and emperours hath now converted sultan shamurath to tread the path of perfect christendome and now with bishops priests and patriarks they are returned back to babylon to christen all that heathen nation think this is done and now again suppose that guy of warwick after he had seen his saviours tomb and there had offered up as monuments of lasting memory his sword his shield and warlike furniture he there vow'd never to bear armes again and now towards england is returning back
imagine that sir raynborn his fair son is grown a man and hearing of the deeds of his great father leaveth all his friends to seek him out in forrain nations
think this is done and now again suppose that guy of warwick now is waxen old and at the length of many a weary step he comes to england where perforce alas he must oppose his weak decayed limbs against the vigor of a gyants strength for now the danes in absence of this lord have set their feet so far on englands ground that they had almost conquered all the land and to a forced parley drives the king how they conclude and by what means agree time shall make known to you immediately

thy crown and kingdome is by conquest won yet if thou canst provide a champion that dares encounter mighty colbron here if he that fights for thee do win the day all title to thy crown wee'l lay away but if that colbron gets the day in field the english power to the danes shall yield and then thy homage and thy princely crown will swanus bear to denmark as his own
i force perforce must yield to thy demand but had i guy of warwick thou shouldst know thy gyants force he soon would overthrow
i tell thee king no weak bred arm of thine can shed one drop of mighty colbrons blood whilst i have power or any strength to stand or grasp this truncheon in my warlike hand for in my fury i will take my foe and fling him higher then the moons bright sphear then bandying back the foot ball of my rage cast him down headlong to the neighbouring seas
no more no more to morrow is the day
when might or right shall bear the crown away
enter guy being old
thus one and twenty winters have i been a very stranger to my home bred soyle and never set my feet on english ground in foraign countries have i eat my bread and now bring winter on my snow white head which of my friends that meets me by the way will once imagine that i am sir guy that vanquisht knights and made stout monsters die

and with sweet sleep my wanward thoughts beguile
enter athelstone with guy disguis'd
what means your majesty thus carelesly to walk abroad without your wonted guard
i'le have no guard unlesse thy self with me for know this night as i lay in my bed a blessed angel bright and christaline in golden slumber did appear to me bidding me walk out of my castle gate and the first man that i should meet withal choose him my champion to defend my right which makes me rise thus early for to see this heaven bred champion sent to let us free
guy starts from his sleep
give me my sword mine armour and my shield that i may coap with hybean hercules the horrid villain in a centaures shape hath ravisht layda on her wedding day therefore i hand to hand will coap with him were he the master monster of the world alas where am i poor distressed man

may i be bold to crave which is the way that leads directly unto winchester
this path good father leads to winchester
o heaven what should i think my dream pretend that will'd me choose the first man i should meet but this good aged man is far unfit yet will i ask his counsel in this cause that may avail me far more then his strength good father may a stranger be so bold to have some private conference with thy self
speak on good sir and what so e're it be my truth i give to keep it secretly
then know good father that i am a king my courts beset with many enemies and this last night as i lay in my bed a heavenly vision did appear to me bidding me rise up streight and walk abroad and the first man that i should meet withal choose him my champion to defend my right thou aged father art the first i meet but he that doth maintain this fight is a most monstrous gyant huge and strong and thou art feeble weak and impotent yet thy counsel father what i were best to do
do as heaven wills ye do my gracious lord if by the all fore seeing power thereof i am appointed for to do this deed though i be old yet you shall well perceive i'le not give back nor yield one foot of ground what though he be a gyant that maintaines this deadly combate
ere i'le turn my face i'le leave my body breathlesse in this place
o how glad's my very soul to see a youthful mind in aged livery

leave of thy braves blaspheming heathen dog for god whose quarrel i do take in hand will add fresh strength to these my withered limbs these aged sinews that are weak and old he can renew with monster conquering strength therefore to shew i do not fear thy threats sound an alarum lets begin the fight for with my palmers staffe i'le coap with thee
thou shalt not hazard so thy honoured age begirt thy self with these wars ornaments
what shall i do
unhappy wretched man for when i left the wars of palestine i made a vow even in the sight of heaven never to fight with sword or shield again but i must break that vow or leave this land my native country to the violent hand of damned usurpers which shall never be i'le break my oath and sweet heaven pardon me
here do i take this sword into my hand and buckle fast this shield unto my arme although i know it is no armed hand that can prevail but heaven where truth doth stand and now thou great arch guyder of the world that saved daniell in the lyons den look down on me with thy all pitious eyes and by my hand vanquish thy enemies that all may say in glory to thy name that little david hath goliath slain st

upon condition that your majesty will vow to keep close what i shall reveal i will resolve your princely mind at full

i take your princely word then know great king i am your subject and in england born and many favours have receiv'd of you past the deserts of my unworthinesse for which it glads my soul that e're i dye i have done some service for your majesty
when i was young men knew me by my looks but now the hand of age hath chang'd me so that not one man doth guy of warwick know
so said my soul when i first saw thy face welcome o welcome to thy native soile which thou hast freed from ruine and from spoil and ten times welcome art thou unto me thy absence long hath wrought my misery but tell me hast thou seen fair phillis yet
my lord i have not nor i do not know whether my beloved phillis lives or no

where no man ne're shall hear of thee at all nor give thy body christian burial yes i will hye me strair to phillis gate and there reveal my self and my estate and my dear phillis whom i loved best shall close mine eyes and bring my soul to rest
but wilt thou break that vow of sanctity which thou didst make to him that hath made thee and seek to contradict his holy will that hath shew'd such great mercies to thee still o god forbid
that vow true kept shall be i'le commit all to him that saved me
and when i dye instead of tomb or grave i'le leave my body in my stone cold cave
thither i will and spend my short sweet dayes in contemplation and in holy pra•ers i poor old guy go hye and hast thee thither for life and pilprimage must end together
ha ha the world's well amended with me by lady why
i am as plumb as a pudding now for ever fince i came to my young master i have been so pust up with good chear that barly puddings are no meat nor cheese cakes nor custards no banquetting stuffe with me for as soon as ever we ca me into england my young master goes to the court present∣ly where he and i were counterpain'd with such implements as passes i am tost up and down like a shittlecock in every bo∣dies mouth for who but master sparrow the greatest traveller that has been at cost twenty nobles and jerico and i cannot tell ye where but for all that i was serv'd a sluttish trick to day for my master being bidden to great a gentlemans house to din ner took me along with him to wait at the table wel as they were at dinner the serving men as they took off the meat set it before the fire to keep it warm for themselves i seeing the good chear standing in battle ray and having not broke my fast of all day i began to draw near the fire and look over my shoulder upon the victuals at last i spyed a fat legg of pork o how my teeth did water to look upon't
i had not stood long but seeing every body busie i whipt the legg of pork into my pocket and stood very mannerly with my hands at my back as though i had done nothing but it was not long e're the fat pork with the heat of the fire began to fry out of my slops & all the dogs in the house came snukering and licking about my breeches and not content with that but one unmannerly cur above all the rest popt his nose into my pocket snatcht out the leg of pork & tore •way all the tone side of my breeches that i was sain to go out edgling like a crab ifaith put i'le ne're steal pork again while i live i'le have one bit of mutton what∣some're comes on't ifaith
enter guy being in his cave to him the angell
now guy of warwick is accomplished the full effect of all thy pilgrimage then rise and pray thy sins may be forgiven for angels wait to bear thy soul to heaven
gods will be done i am resolv'd to dye and have askt mercy at the hands of him that gave me life and now will take the same
o what a pretious soul hath sinful man
that in it self alone does comprehend the figure state and lineaments of heaven yet cannot measure nor define it self so when that all great workmen of the world had fram'd mans flesh out of a clod of clay and all the creatures of the universal world of the same mould to whom his very word gave present life onely in mans brest that vil'd ambitious sinful heap of drosse he breathd his own breath even the breath of heaven that is the glorious soul we now possesse which is immortal and can never dye
yet he that late was fram'd of mire and filth plac'd in a glorious state of innocence was not content but striv'd to be as good as his great maker who could with one word throw him down headlong to the deepest hell yet he in mercy love and meer good will did grant him pardon for his soul offence and seeing him unable to perform his blessed will did send his own dear son to pay his ransome with his pretious blood and to redeem that soul which sinful man had forfeited to satan death and he•l and for a death dam'd cursed and unpure he gave him life eternal to indure which life eternal grant sweet christ to me that in heavens joyes i may thy glory see
