the country near nottingham
enter wellborn in tattered apparel tapwell and froth
not a suck sir nor the remainder of a single can left by a drunken porter all night palled too
not the dropping of the tap for your morning's draught sir 'tis verity i assure you
the devil turned precisian
rogue what am tap
troth durst i trust you with a looking glass to let you see your trim shape you would quit me and take the name yourself well
and i must tell you if you but advance your plymouth cloak you shall be soon instructed there dwells and within call if it please your worship a potent monarch called the constable that does command a citadel called the stocks whose guards are certain files of rusty billmen such as with great dexterity will hale your tattered lousy − well
at his own peril − do not put yourself in too much heat there being no water near to quench your thirst and sure for other liquor as mighty ale or beer they are things i take it you must no more remember not in a dream sir
why thou unthankful villain dar'st thou talk thus
is not thy house and all thou hast my gift
i find it not in chalk and timothy tapwell does keep no other register
am not i he whose riots fed and clothed thee
wert thou not born on my father's land and proud to be a drudge in his house
what i was sir it skills not what you are is apparent now for a farewell since you talk of father in my hope it will torment you i'll briefly tell your story
your dead father my quondam master was a man of worship old sir john wellborn justice of peace and quorum and stood fair to be custos rotulorum bore the whole sway of the shire kept a great house relieved the poor and so forth but he dying and the twelve hundred a year coming to you late master francis but now forlorn wellborn − well
or i shall lose myself
very hardly you cannot out of your way
but to my story you were then a lord of acres the prime gallant and i your under butler note the change now you had a merry time of’t hawks and hounds with choice of running horses mistresses of all sorts and all sizes yet so hot as their embraces made your lordship melt which your uncle sir giles overreach observing resolving not to lose a drop of them on foolish mortgages statutes and bonds for a while supplied your looseness and then left you
some curate hath penned this invective mongrel and you have studied it
i have not done yet your land gone and your credit not worth a token you grew the common borrower no man 'scaped your paper pellets from the gentleman to the beggars on highways that sold you switches in your gallantry
i shall switch your brains out
where poor tim tapwell with a little stock some forty pounds or so bought a small cottage humbled myself to marriage with my froth here gave entertainment − well
yes to whores and canters clubbers by night − tap
true but they brought in profit and had a gift to pay for what they called for and stuck not like your mastership
the poor income i gleaned from them hath made me in my parish thought worthy to be scavenger and in time i may rise to be overseer of the poor which if i do on your petition wellborn i may allow you thirteen pence a quarter
and you shall thank my worship
thus you dog bolt and thus − beats and kicks him
to his wife cry out for help
stir and thou diest − your potent prince the constable shall not save you
hear me ungrateful hell hound
did not i make purses for you
then you licked my boots and thought your holiday cloak too coarse to clean them
'twas i that when i heard thee swear if ever thou couldst arrive at forty pounds thou wouldst live like an emperor twas i that gave it in ready gold
i must sir for from the tavern to the taphouse all on forfeiture of their licenses stand bound ne'er to remember who their best guests were if they grew poor like you
they are well rewarded that beggar themselves to make such cuckolds rich
thou viper thankless viper
− but since you are grown forgetful i will help your memory and tread you into mortar nor leave one bone unbroken
'twill not be granted
hold − for my sake hold
− deny me frank
they are not worth your anger
for once thou hast redeemed them from this sceptre but let them vanish creeping on their knees and if they grumble i revoke my pardon
this comes of your prating husband you presumed on your ambling wit and must use your glib tongue though you are beaten lame for't
patience froth there's law to cure our bruises
they crawl off on their hands and knees
sent to your mother
my lady frank my patroness my all
she's such a mourner for my father's death and in her love to him so favours me that i cannot pay too much observance to her
there are few such stepdames
'tis a noble widow and keeps her reputation pure and clear from the least taint of infamy her life with the splendour of her actions leaves no tongue to envy or detraction
prithee tell me has she no suitors
even the best of the shire frank my lord excepted such as sue and send and send and sue again but to no purpose their frequent visits have not gained her presence
yet she's so far from sullenness and pride that i dare undertake you shall meet from her a liberal entertainment i can give you a catalogue of her suitors' names
forbear it while i give you good counsel i am bound to it
thy father was my friend and that affection i bore to him in right descends to thee thou art a handsome and a hopeful youth nor will i have the least affront stick on thee if i with any danger can prevent it
i thank your noble care but pray you in what do i run the hazard
art thou not in love
put it not off with wonder
in love at my years
you think you walk in clouds but are transparent
i have heard all and the choice that you have made and with my finger can point out the north star by which the loadstone of your folly's guided and to confirm this true what think you of fair margaret the only child and heir of cormorant overreach
does it blush and start to hear her only named
blush at your want of wit and reason
you are too bitter sir
wounds of this nature are not to be cured with balms but corrosives
i must be plain art thou scarce manumised from the porter's lodge and yet sworn servant to the pantofle and dar'st thou dream of marriage
i fear 'twill be concluded for impossible that there is now or e'er shall be hereafter a handsome page or player's boy of fourteen but either loves a wench or drabs love him court waiters not exempted
howe'er you have discovered my intents you know my aims are lawful and if ever the queen of flowers the glory of the spring the sweetest comfort to our smell the rose sprang from an envious briar i may infer there's such disparity in their conditions between the goodness of my soul the daughter and the base churl her father
grant this true as i believe it canst thou ever hope to enjoy a quiet bed with her whose father ruined thy state
i confess it true i must tell you as a friend and freely that where impossibilities are apparent 'tis indiscretiön to nourish hopes
canst thou imagine let not self love blind thee that sir giles overreach that to make her great in swelling titles without touch of conscience will cut his neighbour's throat and i hope his own too will e'er consent to make her thine
give o'er and think of some course suitable to thy rank and prosper in it
you have well advised me
but in the mean time you that are so studious of my affairs wholly neglect your own remember yourself and in what plight you are
no matter no matter
yes 'tis much material you know my fortune and my means yet something i can spare from myself to help your wants
nay be not angry there's eight pieces to put you in better fashion
one that lives at the devotion of a stepmother and the uncertain favour of a lord
i'll eat my arms first
howsoe'er blind fortune hath spent the utmost of her malice on me − though i am vomited out of an alehouse and thus accoutred − know not where to eat or drink or sleep but underneath this canopy − although i thank thee i despise thy offer and as i in my madness broke my state without the assistance of another's brain in my right wits i'll piece it at the worst die thus and be forgotten
i a room in lady allworth's house
enter order amble furnace and watchall
set all things right or as my name is order and by this staff of office that commands you this chain and double ruff symbols of power whoever misses in his functiön for one whole week makes forfeiture of his breakfast and privilege in the wine cellar
you are merry good master steward
let him i'll be angry
why fellow furnace 'tis not twelve o'clock yet nor dinner taking up then 'tis allowed cooks by their places may be choleric
you think you have spoke wisely goodman amble my lady's go before
nay nay no wrangling
twit me with the authority of the kitchen
at all hours and all places i'll be angry and thus provoked when i am at my prayers i will be angry
there was no hurt meant
i am friends with thee and yet i will be angry
no matter whom yet now i think on it i am angry with my lady
what cause has she given thee
cause enough master steward
i was entertained by her to please her palate and till she forswore eating i performed it
now since our master noble allworth died though i crack my brains to find out tempting sauces and raise fortifications in the pastry such as might serve for models in the low countries which if they had been practisèd at breda spinola might have thrown his cap at it and ne'er took it
but you had wanted matter there to work on
with six eggs and a strike of rye meal i had kept the town till doomsday perhaps longer
but what's this to your pet against my lady
marry this when i am three parts roasted and the fourth part parboiled to prepare her viands she keeps her chamber dines with a panada or water gruel my sweat never thought on
but your art is seen in the dining room
by such as pretend love to her but come to feed upon her
yet of all the harpies that do devour her i am out of charity with none so much as the thin gutted squire that's stolen into commission
the same the same meat's cast away upon him it never thrives he holds this paradox who eats not well can ne'er do justice well his stomach's as insatiate as the grave or strumpets' ravenous appetites
our late young master
re enter watchall and allworth

we are all your servants
in you he lives
at once my thanks to all this is yet some comfort
is my lady stirring
enter lady allworth waiting woman and chambermaid
her presence answers for us
sort those silks well
i'll take the air alone
exeunt waiting woman and chambermaid
you air and air but will you never taste but spoon meat more
to what use serve all
prithee be not angry i shall ere long i' the mean time there is gold to buy thee aprons and a summer suit
i am appeased and furnace now grows cool
and as i gave directions if this morning i am visited by any entertain them as heretofore but say in my excuse i am indisposed
do and leave them
nay stay you allworth
exeunt order amble furnace and watchall
i shall gladly grow here to wait on your commands
so soon turned courtier
style not that courtship madam which is duty purchased on your part
well you shall o'ercome i'll not contend in words
how is it with your noble master
ever like himself no scruple lessened in the full weight of honour
he did command me pardon my presumption as his unworthy deputy to kiss your ladyship's fair hands
i am honoured in his favour to me
does he hold his purpose for the low countries
constantly good madam but he will in person first present his service
and how approve you of his course
you are yet like virgin parchment capable of any inscription vicious or honourable
i will not force your will but leave you free to your own election
any form you please i will put on but might i make my choice with humble emulation i would follow the path my lord marks to me
'tis well answered and i commend your spirit you had a father blessed be his memory
that some few hours before the will of heaven took him from me who did commend you by the dearest ties of perfect love between us to my charge and therefore what i speak you are bound to hear with such respect as if he lived in me
he was my husband and howe'er you are not son of my womb you may be of my love provided you deserve it
i have found you most honoured madam the best mother to me and with my utmost strengths of care and service will labour that you never may repent your bounties showered upon me
i much hope it
these were your father's words "if e'er my son follow the war tell him it is a school where all the principles tending to honour are taught if truly followed but for such as repair thither as a place in which they do presume they may with license practise their lusts and riots they shall never merit the noble name of soldiers
to dare boldly in a fair cause and for their country's safety to run upon the cannon's mouth undaunted to obey their leaders and shun mutinies to bear with patiënce the winter's cold and summer's scorching heat and not to faint when plenty of provision fails with hunger are the essential parts make up a soldier not swearing dice or drinking
there's no syllable you speak but is to me an oracle which but to doubt were impious
to conclude beware ill company for often men are like to those with whom they do converse and from one man i warn you and that's wellborn not 'cause he's poor that rather claims your pity but that he's in his manners so debauched and hath to vicious courses sold himself
'tis true your father loved him while he was worthy the loving but if he had lived to have seen him as he is he had cast him off as you must do
i shall obey in all things
follow me to my chamber you shall have gold to furnish you like my son and still supplied as i hear from you
i am still your creature

her reason i hope assures her though she make herself close prisoner ever for her husband's loss 'twill not recover him
sir it is her will
which we that are her servants ought to serve and not dispute howe'er you are nobly welcome and if you please to stay that you may think so there came not six days since from hull a pipe of rich canary which shall spend itself for my lady's honour
is it of the right race
how his mouth runs o'er
i'll make it run and run
save your good worship
honest master cook thy hand again how i love thee
are the good dishes still in being
if you have a mind to feed there is a chine of beef well seasoned
that i might now give thanks for't
besides there came last night from the forest of sherwood the fattest stag i ever cooked
a stag sir part of it prepared for dinner and baked in puff paste
sir giles a ponderous chine of beef
and red deer too sir giles and baked in puff paste
all business set aside let us give thanks here
how the lean skeleton's rapt
you know we cannot
your worships are to sit on a commission and if you fail to come you lose the cause
cause me no causes
i'll prove't for such dinner we may put off a commission you shall find it henrici decimo quarto
will you lose me a thousand pounds for a dinner
no more for shame
we must forget the belly when we think of profit
well you shall o'er rule me i could e'en cry now
− do you hear master cook send but a corner of that immortal pasty and i in thankfulness will by your boy send you − a brace of three pences
will you be so prodigal
remember me to your lady
− who have we here
i did once but now i will not thou art no blood of mine
if ever thou presume to own me more i'll have thee caged and whipped
i'll grant the warrant
− think of pie corner furnace
exeunt overreach greedy and marrall
will you out sir
i wonder how you durst creep in
this is rudeness and saucy impudence
cannot you stay to be served among your fellows from the basket but you must press into the hall
prithee vanish into some outhouse though it be the pigstye my scullion shall come to thee
this is rare oh here's tom allworth
we must be strangers nor would i have you seen here for a million
he contemns me too
enter waiting woman and chambermaid
foh what a smell's here
a creature made out of the privy let us hence for love's sake or i shall swoon
i begin to faint already
exeunt waiting woman and chambermaid
will you know your way
or shall we teach it you by the head and shoulders
no i will not stir do you mark i will not let me see the wretch that dares attempt to force me
why you slaves created only to make legs and cringe to carry in a dish and shift a trencher that have not souls only to hope a blessing beyond black jacks or flagons you that were born only to consume meat and drink and batten upon reversions
who shews me the way
enter lady allworth waiting woman and chambermaid
sweet madam keep your glove to your nose
or let me fetch some perfumes may be predominant you wrong yourself else
madam my designs bear me to you
and though i have met with but ragged entertainment from your grooms here i hope from you to receive that noble usage as may become the true friend of your husband and then i shall forget these
i am amazed to see and hear this rudeness
darest thou think though sworn that it can ever find belief that i who to the best men of this country denied my presence since my husband's death can fall so low as to change words with thee thou son of infamy
forbear my house and know and keep the distance that's between us or though it be against my gentler temper i shall take order you no more shall be an eyesore to me
scorn me not good lady but as in form you are angelical imitate the heavenly natures and vouchsafe at the least awhile to hear me
you will grant the blood that runs in this arm is as noble as that which fills your veins those costly jewels and those rich clothes you wear your men's observance and women's flattery are in you no virtues nor these rags with my poverty in me vices
you have a fair fame and i know deserve it yet lady i must say in nothing more than in the pious sorrow you have shewn for your late noble husband
and hardly can keep finger from the eye to hear him named
have you aught else to say
that husband madam was once in his fortune almost as low as i want debts and quarrels lay heavy on him let it not be thought a boast in me though i say i relieved him
'twas i that gave him fashion mine the sword that did on all occasions second his i brought him on and off with honour lady and when in all men's judgments he was sunk and in his own hopes not to be buoyed up i stepped unto him took him by the hand and set him upright
are not we base rogues that could forget this
i confess you made him master of your estate nor could your friends though he brought no wealth with him blame you for it for he had a shape and to that shape a mind made up of all parts either great or noble so winning a behaviour not to be resisted madam
tis most true he had
for his sake then in that i was his friend do not contemn me
for what's past excuse me i will redeem it
− order give the gentleman a hundred pounds
no madam on no terms i will nor beg nor borrow sixpence of you but be supplied elsewhere or want thus ever
only one suit i make which you deny not to strangers and 'tis this
nothing unless you please to charge your servants to throw away a little respect upon me
what you demand is yours
i thank you lady
aside now what can be wrought out of such a suit is yet in supposition − i have said all when you please you may retire
to the servants nay all's forgotten and for a lucky omen to my project shake hands and end all quarrels in the cellar
still merry master wellborn
a room in overreach's house
enter overreach and marrall
he's gone i warrant thee this commission crushed him
your worships have the way on and ne'er miss to squeeze these unthrifts into air and yet the chapfallen justice did his part returning for your advantage the certificate against his conscience and his knowledge too with your good favour to the utter ruin of the poor farmer
'twas for these good ends i made him a justice he that bribes his belly is certain to command his soul
i wonder still with your license why your worship having the power to put this thin gut in commission you are not in't yourself
thou art a fool in being out of office i am out of danger where if i were a justice besides the trouble i might or out of wilfulness or error run myself finely into a premunire and so become a prey to the informer
no i'll have none of’t 'tis enough i keep greedy at my devotion so he serve my purposes let him hang or damn i care not friendship is but a word
you are all wisdom
i would be worldly wise for the other wisdom that does prescribe us a well governed life and to do right to others as ourselves i value not an atom
what course take you with your good patience to hedge in the manor of your neighbour master frugal
as 'tis said he will nor sell nor borrow nor exchange and his land lying in the midst of your many lordships is a foul blemish
i have thought on't marrall and it shall take
i must have all men sellers and i the only purchaser
'tis most fit sir
i'll therefore buy some cottage near his manor which done i'll make my men break ope his fences ride o'er his standing corn and in the night set fire on his barns or break his cattle's legs these trespasses draw on suits and suits expenses which i can spare but will soon beggar him
when i have harried him thus two or three year though he sue in forma pauperis in spite of all his thrift and care he'll grow behindhand
the best i ever heard
i could adore you
then with the favour of my man of law i will pretend some title want will force him to put it to arbitrement then if he sell for half the value he shall have ready money and i possess his land
wellborn was apt to sell and needed not these fine arts sir to hook him in
this varlet marrall lives too long to upbraid me with my close cheat put upon him
will nor cold nor hunger kill him
i know not what to think on't
i have used all means and the last night i caused his host the tapster to turn him out of doors and have been since with all your friends and tenants and on the forfeit of your favour charged them though a crust of mouldy bread would keep him from starving yet they should not relieve him
this is done sir
that was something marrall but thou must go further and suddenly marrall
where and when you please sir
i would have thee seek him out and if thou canst persuade him that 'tis better steal than beg then if i prove he has but robbed a henroost not all the world shall save him from the gallows
do anything to work him to despair and 'tis thy masterpiece
i will do my best sir
i am now on my main work with the lord lovell the gallant minded popular lord lovell the minion of the people's love
i hear he's come into the country and my aims are to insinuate myself into his knowledge and then invite him to my house
i have you this points at my young mistress
she must part with that humble title and write honourable right honourable marrall my right honourable daughter if all i have or e'er shall get will do it
i'll have her well attended there are ladies of errant knights decayed and brought so low that for cast clothes and meat will gladly serve her
and 'tis my glory though i come from the city to have their issue whom i have undone to kneel to mine as bondslaves
'tis fit state sir
and therefore i'll not have a chambermaid that ties her shoes or any meaner office but such whose fathers were right worshipful
'tis a rich man's pride
there having ever been more than a feud a strange antipathy between us and true gentry
see who's here sir
sir your wife's nephew she and my father tumbled in one belly
thy breath's infectious rogue
i shun thee as a leprosy or the plague
come hither marrall – aside this is the time to work him
i warrant you sir
by this light i think he's mad
had you ta'en compassion on yourself you long since had been mad
you have ta'en a course between you and my venerable uncle to make me so
the more pale spirited you that would not be instructed
i swear deeply − well
the devil's creed − but what would you have done
had there been but one tree in all the shire nor any hope to compass a penny halter before like you i had outlived my fortunes a withe had served my turn to hang myself
i am zealous in your cause pray you hang yourself and presently as you love your credit
will you stay till you die in a ditch or lice devour you
− or if you dare not do the feat yourself but that you'll put the state to charge and trouble is there no purse to be cut house to be broken or market woman with eggs that you may murder and so dispatch the business
here's variety i must confess but i'll accept of none of all your gentle offers i assure you
why have you hope ever to eat again or drink
or be the master of three farthings
if you like not hanging drown yourself
take some course for your reputation
'twill not do dear tempter with all the rhetoric the fiend hath taught you
i am as far as thou art from despair nay i have confidence which is more than hope to live and suddenly better than ever
these castles you build in the air will not persuade me or to give or lend a token to you
i'll be more kind to thee come thou shalt dine with me
nay more dine gratis
under what hedge i pray you
or at whose cost
are they padders or abram men that are your consorts
thou art incredulous but thou shalt dine not alone at her house but with a gallant lady with me and with a lady
with the lady of the lake or queen of fairies
for i know it must be an enchanted dinner
with the lady allworth knave
nay now there's hope thy brain is cracked
mark there with what respect i am entertained
with choice no doubt of dog whips
why dost thou ever hope to pass her porter
'tis not far off go with me trust thine own eyes
troth in my hope or my assurance rather to see thee curvet and mount like a dog in a blanket if ever thou presume to pass her threshold i will endure thy company

i am satisfied farewell tom
all joy stay with you
you are happily encountered i yet never presented one so welcome a i know you will be to my lady

i am glad you are come until i know your pleasure i knew not how to serve up my lady's dinner
marry sir i have some grouse and turkey chicken some rails and quails and my lady willed me ask you what kind of sauces best affect your palate that i may use my utmost skill to please it
aside the devil's entered this cook sauce for his palate
that on my knowledge for almost this twelvemonth durst wish but cheese parings and brown bread on sundays
that way i like them best
it shall be done sir
what think you of the hedge we shall dine under
" shall we feed gratis
i know not what to think pray you make me not mad
this place becomes you not pray you walk sir to the dining room
i am well here till her ladyship quits her chamber
well here say you
'tis a rare change
but yesterday you thought yourself well in a barn wrapped up in peas straw
re enter waiting woman and chambermaid
sir you are wished for
my lady dreamt sir of you
and the first command she gave after she rose was her devotions done to give her notice when you approached here
which is done on my virtue
i shall be converted i begin to grow into a new belief which saints nor angels could have won me to have faith in
i come to meet you and languished till i saw you
this first kiss is for form i allow a second to such a friend
to such a friend
i am wholly yours yet madam if you please to grace this gentleman with a salute − mar
salute me at his bidding
i shall receive it as a most high favour
sir you may command me
advances to kiss marrall who retires
run backward from a lady
and such a lady
to kiss her foot is to poor me a favour i am unworthy of
offers to kiss her foot
nay pray you rise and since you are so humble i'll exalt you you shall dine with me to day at mine own table
i am not good enough to sit at your steward's board
you are too modest i will not be denied
will you still be babbling till your meat freeze on the table

i was ne'er so graced
exeunt wellborn lady allworth amble marrall waiting woman and chambermaid
we have played our parts and are come off well but if i know the mystery why my lady consented to it or why master wellborn desired it may i perish
would i had the roasting of his heart that cheated him and forces the poor gentleman to these shifts
for cooks are persians and swear by it of all the griping and extorting tyrants i ever heard or read of i ne'er met a match to sir giles overreach
what will you take to tell him so fellow furnace
just as much as my throat is worth for that would be the price on't
to have a usurer that starves himself and wears a cloak of one and twenty years on a suit of fourteen groats bought of the hangman to grow rich and then purchase is too common but this sir giles feeds high keeps many servants who must at his command do any outrage rich in his habit vast in his expenses yet he to admiration still increases in wealth and lordships
he frights men out of their estates and breaks through all law nets made to curb ill men as they were cobwebs
no man dares reprove him
such a spirit to dare and power to do were never lodged so unluckily

my lady drank to him for fashion sake or to please master wellborn as i live he rises and takes up a dish in which there were some remnants of a boiled capon and pledges her in white broth
nay 'tis like the rest of his tribe
and when i brought him wine he leaves his stool and after a leg or two most humbly thanks my worship
i shall be chid

i hope jack marrall shall not live so long to prove himself such an unmannerly beast though it hail hazel nuts as to be covered when your worship's present
aside is not this a true rogue that out of mere hope of a future cozenage can turn thus suddenly
i know your worship's wise and needs no counsel yet if in my desire to do you service i humbly offer my advice but still under correction i hope i shall not incur your high displeasure
then in my judgment sir my simple judgment still with your worship's favour i could wish you a better habit for this cannot be but much distasteful to the noble lady i say no more that loves you for this morning to me and i am but a swine to her before the assurance of her wealth perfumed you you savoured not of amber
i do now then
this your batoon hath got a touch of it
− kisses the end of his cudgel
yet if you please for change i have twenty pounds here which out of my true love i'll presently lay down at your worship's feet 'twill serve to buy you a riding suit
but where's the horse
my gelding is at your service nay you shall ride me before your worship shall be put to the trouble to walk afoot
when you are lord of this lady's manor as i know you will be you may with the lease of glebe land called knave's acre a place i would manure requite your vassal
i thank thy love but must make no use of it what's twenty pounds
'tis all that i can make sir
dost thou think though i want clothes i could not have them for one word to my lady
as i know not that
come i will tell thee a secret and so leave thee
i will not give her the advantage though she be a gallant minded lady after we are married there being no woman but is sometimes froward to hit me in the teeth and say she was forced to buy my wedding clothes and took me on with a plain riding suit and an ambling nag
no i'll be furnished something like myself and so farewell for thy suit touching knave's acre when it is mine 'tis thine
i thank your worship
− how was i cozened in the calculation of this man's fortune
my master cozened too whose pupil i am in the art of undoing men for that is our profession
well well master wellborn you are of a sweet nature and fit again to be cheated which if the fates please when you are possessed of the land and lady you sans question shall be
i'll presently think of the means
enter overreach speaking to a servant within
sirrah take my horse
i'll walk to get me an appetite 'tis but a mile and exercise will keep me from being pursy
perhaps the knave has wrought the prodigal to do some outrage on himself and now he feels compunction in his conscience for't no matter so it be done
how succeed we in our plot on wellborn
has he hanged or drowned himself
no sir he lives lives once more to be made a prey to you a greater prey than ever
art thou in thy wits
if thou art reveal this miracle and briefly
a lady sir is fallen in love with him
the rich lady allworth
how dar'st thou speak this
and i do so but once a year unless it be to you sir we dined with her ladyship i thank his worship
as i live sir i dined with him at the great lady's table simple as i stand here and saw when she kissed him and would at his request have kissed me too but i was not so audacious as some youths are that dare do anything be it ne'er so absurd and sad after performance
to tell me these impossibilities
dine at her table
− impudent varlet have not i myself to whom great countesses' doors have oft flew open ten times attempted since her husband's death in vain to see her though i came − a suitor
and yet your good solicitorship and rogue wellborn were brought into her presence feasted with her
− but that i know thee a dog that cannot blush this most incredible lie would call up one on thy buttermilk cheeks
shall i not trust my eyes sir or taste
i feel her good cheer in my belly
you shall feel me if you give not over sirrah recover your brains again and be no more gulled with a beggar's plot assisted by the aids of serving men and chambermaids for beyond these thou never saw'st a woman or i'll quit you from my employments
will you credit this yet
on my confidence of their marriage i offered wellborn − aside
i would give a crown now i durst say his worship − my nag and twenty pounds
did you so idiot
was this the way to work him to despair or rather to cross me
will your worship kill me
no no but drive the lying spirit out of you
i have done then now forgetting your late imaginary feast and lady know my lord lovell dines with me to morrow
be careful nought be wanting to receive him and bid my daughter's women trim her up though they paint her so she catch the lord i'll thank them there's a piece for my late blows
aside i must yet suffer but there may be a time − over
the country near overreach's house
enter lord lovell allworth and servants
walk the horses down the hill something in private i must impart to allworth
o my lord what sacrifice of reverence duty watching although i could put off the use of sleep and ever wait on your commands to serve them what dangers though in ne'er so horrid shapes nay death itself though i should run to meet it can i and with a thankful willingness suffer
but still the retribution will fall short of your bounties showered upon me
loving youth till what i purpose be put into act do not o'erprize it since you have trusted me with your soul's nearest nay her dearest secret rest confident 'tis in a cabinet locked treachery shall never open
i have found you for so much to your face i must profess howe'er you guard your modesty with a blush for't more zealous in your love and service to me than i have been in my rewards
still great ones above my merit
such your gratitude calls them nor am i of that harsh and rugged temper as some great men are taxed with who imagine they part from the respect due to their honours if they use not all such as follow them without distinction of their births like slaves
i am not so conditioned i can make a fitting difference between my footboy and a gentleman by want compelled to serve me
'tis thankfully acknowledged you have been more like a father to me than a master pray you pardon the comparison
i allow it and to give you assurance i am pleased in't my carriage and demeanour to your mistress fair margaret shall truly witness for me i can command my passions
'tis a conquest few lords can boast of when they are tempted − oh
why do you sigh
can you be doubtful of me
by that fair name i in the wars have purchased and all my actions hitherto untainted i will not be more true to mine own honour than to my allworth
as you are the brave lord lovell your bare word only given is an assurance of more validity and weight to me than all the oaths bound up with imprecations which when they would deceive most courtiers practice yet being a man for sure to style you more would relish of gross flattery i am forced against my confidence of your worth and virtues to doubt nay more to fear
so young and jealous
were you to encounter with a single foe the victory were certain but to stand the charge of two such potent enemies at once assaulting you as wealth and beauty and those too seconded with power is odds too great for hercules
speak your doubts and fears since you will nourish them in plainer language
that i may understand them
what's your will though i lend arms against myself provided they may advantage you must be obeyed
my much loved lord were margaret only fair the cannon of her more than earthly form though mounted high commanding all beneath it and rammed with bullets of her sparkling eyes of all the bulwarks that defend your senses could batter none but that which guards your sight
but when the well tuned accents of her tongue make music to you and with numerous sounds assault your hearing such as ulysses if he now lived again howe'er he stood the syrens could not resist the combat must grow doubtful between your reason and rebellious passions
add this too when you feel her touch and breath like a soft western wind when it glides o'er arabia creating gums and spices and in the van the nectar of her lips which you must taste bring the battalia on well armed and strongly lined with her discourse and knowing manners to give entertainment − hippolytus himself would leave diana to follow such a venus
love hath made you poetical allworth
grant all these beat off which if it be in man to do you'll do it mammon in sir giles overreach steps in with heaps of ill got gold and so much land to make her more remarkable as would tire a falcon's wings in one day to fly over
o my good lord
these powerful aids which would make a mis shapen negro beautiful yet are but ornaments to give her lustre that in herself is all perfection must prevail for her i here release your trust 'tis happiness enough for me to serve you and sometimes with chaste eyes to look upon her
why shall i swear
o by no means my lord and wrong not so your judgment to the world as from your fond indulgence to a boy your page your servant to refuse a blessing divers great men are rivals for
suspend your judgment till the trial
how far is it to overreach' house
at the most some half hour's riding you'll soon be there
and you the sooner freed from your jealous fears
o that i durst but hope it
a room in overreach's house
enter overreach greedy and marrall
spare for no cost let my dressers crack with the weight of curious viands
"store indeed's no sore" sir
that proverb fits your stomach master greedy
and let no plate be seen but what's pure gold or such whose workmanship exceeds the matter that it is made of let my choicest linen perfume the room and when we wash the water with precious powders mixed so please my lord that he may with envy wish to bathe so ever
'twill be very chargeable
now all my laboured ends are at the stake is't a time to think of thrift
call in my daughter
and master justice since you love choice dishes and plenty of them − greedy
as i do indeed sir almost as much as to give thanks for them
i do confer that providence with my power of absolute command to have abundance to your best care
i'll punctually discharge it and give the best directions
now am i in mine own conceit a monarch at the least arch president of the boiled the roast the baked for which i will eat often and give thanks when my belly's braced up like a drum and that's pure justice
it must be so should the foolish girl prove modest she may spoil all she had it not from me but from her mother i was ever forward as she must be and therefore i'll prepare her
alone − and let your women wait without
this is a neat dressing
these orient pearls and diamonds well placed too
the gown affects me not it should have been embroidered o'er and o'er with flowers of gold but these rich jewèls and quaint fashion help it
since oft the wanton eye the face observed descends unto the foot which being well proportioned as yours is invites as much as perfect white and red though without art
how like you your new woman the lady downfallen
well for a companion not as a servant
is she humble meg and careful too her ladyship forgotten
i pity her fortune
i took her up in an old tamin gown even starved for want of twopenny chops to serve thee and if i understand she but repines to do thee any duty though ne'er so servile i'll pack her to her knight where i have lodged him into the counter and there let them howl together
you know your own ways but for me i blush when i command her that was once attended with persons not inferior to myself in birth
why art thou not my daughter the blest child of my industry and wealth
why foolish girl was't not to make thee great that i have run and still pursue those ways that hale down curses on me which i mind not
part with these humble thoughts and apt thyself to the noble state i labour to advance thee or by my hopes to see thee honourable i will adopt a stranger to my heir and throw thee from my care do not provoke me
i will not sir mould me which way you please
'tis matter of importance
the cook sir is self willed and will not learn from my experience there's a fawn brought in sir and for my life i cannot make him roast it with a norfolk dumpling in the belly of it and sir we wise men know without the dumpling 'tis not worth three pence
would it were whole in thy belly to stuff it out
cook it any way prithee leave me
without order for the dumpling
let it be dumpled which way thou wilt or tell him i will scald him in his own caldron
i had lost my stomach had i lost my mistress dumpling i'll give thanks for't
but to our business meg you have heard who dines here
'tis an honourable man a lord meg and commands a regiment of soldiers and what's rare is one himself a bold and understanding one and to be a lord and a good leader in one volume is granted unto few but such as rise up the kingdom's glory
i'll resign my office if i be not better obeyed
'slight art thou frantic
'twould make me frantic and stark mad were i not a justice of peace and quorum too which this rebellious cook cares not a straw for
there are a dozen of woodcocks − over
make thyself thirteen the baker's dozen
i am contented so they may be dressed to my mind he has found out a new device for sauce and will not dish them with toasts and butter my father was a tailor and my name though a justice greedy woodcock and ere i'll see my lineage so abused i'll give up my commission
− rogue obey him
i have given the word pray you now remove yourself to a collar of brawn and trouble me no further
i will and meditate what to eat at dinner
and as i said meg when this gull disturbed us this honourable lord this colonel i would have thy husband
there's too much disparity between his quality and mine to hope it
i more than hope and doubt not to effect it
be thou no enemy to thyself my wealth shall weigh his titles down and make you equals
now for the means to assure him thine observe me remember he's a courtier and a soldier and not to be trifled with and therefore when he comes to woo you see you do not coy it this mincing modesty has spoiled many a match by a first refusal in vain after hoped for
you'll have me sir preserve the distance that confines a virgin
virgin me no virgins
i must have you lose that name or you lose me
i will have you private − start not − i say private if thou art my true daughter not a bastard thou wilt venture alone with one man though he came like jupiter to semele and come off too and therefore when he kisses you kiss close
i have heard this is the strumpet's fashion sir which i must never learn
learn anything and from any creature that may make thee great from the devil himself
aside this is but devilish doctrine
or if his blood grow hot suppose he offer beyond this do not you stay till it cool but meet his ardour if a couch be near sit down on't and invite him
in your house your own house sir for heaven's sake what are you then
or what shall i be sir
stand not on form words are no substances
though you could dispense with your own honour cast aside religion the hopes of heaven or fear of hell excuse me in worldly policy this is not the way to make me his wife his whore i grant it may do
my maiden honour so soon yielded up nay prostituted cannot but assure him i that am light to him will not hold weight whene'er tempted by others so in judgment when to his lust i have given up my honour he must and will forsake me
do i wear a sword for fashion
or is this arm shrunk up or withered
does there live a man of that large list i have encountered with can truly say i e'er gave inch of ground not purchased with his blood that did oppose me
forsake thee when the thing is done
give me but proof he has enjoyed thy person though all his captains echoes to his will stood armed by his side to justify the wrong and he himself in the head of his bold troop spite of his lordship and his colonelship or the judge's favour i will make him render a bloody and a strict account and force him by marrying thee to cure thy wounded honour
i have said it
sir the man of honour's come newly alighted
in without reply and do as i command or thou art lost
is the loud music i gave order for ready to receive him
let them sound a princely welcome
roughness awhile leave me for fawning now a stranger to my nature must make way for me
enter lord lovell greedy allworth and marrall
sir you meet your trouble
what you are pleased to style so is an honour above my worth and fortunes
aside strange so humble

that kiss came twanging off i like it quit the room
− exeunt all but overreach lovell and margaret
a little bashful my good lord but you i hope will teach her boldness
i am happy in such a scholar but − over
i am past learning and therefore leave you to yourselves − aside to margaret remember
you see fair lady your father is solicitous to have you change the barren name of virgin into a hopeful wife
his haste my lord holds no power o'er my will
but o'er your duty
which forced too much may break
bend rather sweetest think of your years
too few to match with yours and choicest fruits too soon plucked rot and wither
do you think i am old
i am sure i am too young
i can advance you
to a hill of sorrow where every hour i may expect to fall but never hope firm footing
you are noble i of a low descent however rich and tissues matched with scarlet suit but ill
o my good lord i could say more but that i dare not trust these walls
pray you trust my ear then
re enter overreach behind listening
and by their postures a consent on both parts
re enter greedy behind
sir giles sir giles
the great fiend stop that clapper
it must ring out sir when my belly rings noon
the baked meats are run out the roast turned powder
i shall powder you
beat me to dust i care not in such a cause as this i'll die a martyr
marry and shall you barathrum of the shambles
strike a justice of peace
'tis petty treason edwardi quinto but that you are my friend i would commit you without bail or mainprize
leave your bawling sir or i shall commit you where you shall not dine to day disturb my lord when he is in discourse
is't a time to talk when we should be munching
i heard some noise
shall we break a bargain almost made up
lady i understand you and rest most happy in your choice believe it i'll be a careful pilot to direct your yet uncertain bark to a port of safety
so shall your honour save two lives and bind us your slaves forever
i am in the act rewarded since it is good howe'er you must put on an amorous carriage towards me to delude your subtle father
i am prone to that
now break we off our conference
where is sir giles
re enter allworth marrall and greedy
my noble lord and how does your lordship find her
apt sir giles and coming and i like her the better
so do i too
yet should we take forts at the first assault 'twere poor in the defendant i must confirm her with a love letter or two which i must have delivered by my page and you give way to't
with all my soul − a towardly gentleman
your hand good master allworth know my house is ever open to you
aside ‘twas shut till now
well done well done my honourable daughter
thou'rt so already know this gentle youth and cherish him my honourable daughter

enter lady allworth and wellborn
if i find welcome you share in it if not i'll back again now i know your ends for i come armed for all can be objected
lovell kisses lady allworth lady allworth kisses margaret
no am a dolt
the spirit of lies hath entered me
peace patch 'tis more than wonder
an astonishment that does possess me wholly
noble lady this is a favour to prevent my visit the service of my life can never equal
my lord i laid wait for you and much hoped you would have made my poor house your first inn and therefore doubting that you might forget me or too long dwell here having such ample cause in this unequalled beauty for your stay and fearing to trust any but myself with the relation of my service to you i borrowed so much from my long restraint and took the air in person to invite you
your bounties are so great they rob me madam of words to give you thanks
good sir giles overreach
how dost thou marrall
− liked you my meat so ill you'll dine no more with me
i will when you please an it like your ladyship
when you please master greedy if meat can do it you shall be satisfied
− and now my lord pray take into your knowledge this gentleman howe'er his outside's coarse presents wellborn
his inward linings are as fine and fair as any man's wonder not i speak at large and howsoe'er his humour carries him to be thus accoutred or what taint soever for his wild life hath stuck upon his fame he may ere long with boldness rank himself with some that have contemned him
sir giles overreach if i am welcome bid him so
he has been too long a stranger faith you have pray let it be mended
lovell confers aside with wellborn
why sir what do you mean
this is rogue wellborn monster prodigy that should hang or drown himself" no man of worship much less your nephew
well sirrah we shall reckon for this hereafter
i'll not lose my jeer though i be beaten dead for't
let my silence plead in my excuse my lord till better leisure offer itself to hear a full relation of my poor fortunes
i would hear and help them
your dinner waits you
pray you lead we follow
nay you are my guest come dear master wellborn
exeunt all but greedy
" so she said heaven
if my belly would give me leave i could ruminate all day on this i have granted twenty warrants to have him committed from all prisons in the shire to nottingham gaol and now "dear master wellborn
" and "my good nephew
" − but i play the fool to stand here prating and forget my dinner
are they set marrall
long since pray you a word sir
in troth i must my master knowing you are his good friend makes bold with you
and does entreat you more guests being come in than he expected especially his nephew the table being full too you would excuse him and sup with him on the cold meat
no dinner after all my care
'tis but a penance for a meal besides you broke your fast
that was but a bit to stay my stomach a man in commission give place to a tatterdemalion
no bug words sir should his worship hear you − greedy
lose my dumpling too and buttered toasts and woodcocks
if you will dispense a little with your worship and sit with the waiting women you'll have dumpling woodcock and buttered toasts too
this revives me i will gorge there sufficiently
this is the way sir
another room in overreach's house
enter overreach as from dinner
− she neglects my lord and all her compliments applied to wellborn
the garments of her widowhood laid by she now appears as glorious as the spring her eyes fixed on him in the wine she drinks he being her pledge she sends him burning kisses and sits on thorns till she be private with him
she leaves my meat to feed upon his looks and if in our discóurse he be but named from her a deep sigh follows
but why grieve i at this
it makes for me if she prove his all that is hers is mine as i will work him
sir the whole board is troubled at your rising
no matter i'll excuse it prithee marrall watch an occasion to invite my nephew to speak with me in private
"the rogue the lady scorned to look on
you are a wag
enter lady allworth and wellborn
see sir she's come and cannot be without him
with your favour sir after a plenteous dinner i shall make bold to walk a turn or two in your rare garden
there's an arbour too if your ladyship please to use it
exeunt lady allworth and wellborn
now i believe the poet feigned not but was historical when he wrote pasiphaë was enamoured of a bull this lady's lust's more monstrous
− my good lord enter lord lovell margaret and the rest

'tis your nobleness to think it such
i must do you a further wrong in taking away your honourable guest

− nay come master wellborn i must not leave you behind in sooth i must not
rob me not madam of all joys at once let my nephew stay behind he shall have my coach and after some small conferènce between us soon overtake your ladyship
stay not long sir
this parting kiss kisses margaret
you shall every day hear from me by my faithful page
'tis a service i am proud of
exeunt lord lovell lady allworth allworth and marrall
daughter to your chamber
− you may wonder nephew after so long an enmity between us i should desire your friendship
so i do sir 'tis strange to me
but i'll make it no wonder and what is more unfold my nature to you
we worldly men when we see friends and kinsmen past hope sunk in their fortunes lend no hand to lift them up but rather set our feet upon their heads to press them to the bottom as i must yield with you i practised it but now i see you in a way to rise i can and will assist you this rich lady and i am glad of 't is enamoured of you 'tis too apparent nephew
no such thing compassion rather sir
well in a word because your stay is short i'll have you seen no more in this base shape nor shall she say she married you like a beggar or in debt
aside he'll run into the noose and save my labour
you have a trunk of rich clothes not far hence in pawn i will redeem them and that no clamour may taint your credit for your petty debts you shall have a thousand pounds to cut them off and go a free man to the wealthy lady
this done sir out of love and no ends else − over
as it is nephew
binds me still your servant
no compliments you are staid for ere you have supped you shall hear from me
− my coach knaves for my nephew
to morrow i will visit you
here's an uncle in a man's extremes
how much they do belie you that say you are hard hearted
my deeds nephew shall speak my love what men report i weigh not
a room in lady allworth's house
enter lord lovell and allworth
'tis well give me my cloak i now discharge you from further service mind your own affairs i hope they will prove successful
what is blest with your good wish my lord cannot but prosper
let aftertimes report and to your honour how much i stand engaged for i want language to speak my debt yet if a tear or two of joy for your much goodness can supply my tongue's defects i could − lov
nay do not melt this ceremonial thanks to me's superfluous
within is my lord stirring
oh here's your letter let him in
enter overreach greedy and marrall
a good day to my lord
you are an early riser sir giles
and reason to attend your lordship
and you too master greedy up so soon
in troth my lord after the sun is up i cannot sleep for i have a foolish stomach that croaks for breakfast
with your lordship's favour i have a serious question to demand of my worthy friend sir giles
pray you use your pleasure
how far sir giles and pray you answer me upon your credit hold you it to be from your manor house to this of my lady's allworth's
why some four mile
four mile good sir giles − upon your reputation think better for if you do abate but one half quarter of five you do yourself the greatest wrong that can be in the world for four miles riding could not have raised so huge an appetite as i feel gnawing on me
whether you ride or go afoot you are that way still provided an it please your worship
prating before my lord
go to my nephew see all his debts discharged and help his worship to fit on his rich suit
aside i may fit you too
tossed like a dog still
i have writ this morning a few lines to my mistress your fair daughter
'twill fire her for she's wholly yours already − sweet master allworth take my ring 'twill carry you to her presence i dare warrant you and there plead for my good lord if you shall find occasion
that done pray ride to nottingham get a license still by this token
i'll have it dispatched and suddenly my lord that i may say my honourable nay right honourable daughter
take my advice young gentleman get your breakfast 'tis unwholesome to ride fasting i'll eat with you and eat to purpose
some fury's in that gut hungry again
did you not devour this morning a shield of brawn and a barrel of colchester oysters
why that was sir only to scour my stomach a kind of a preparative
− come gentleman i will not have you feed like the hangman of flushing alone while i am here
i will not fail my lord
nor i to line my christmas coffer
exeunt greedy and allworth
to my wish we are private
i come not to make offer with my daughter a certain portion that were poor and trivial in one word i pronounce all that is mine in lands or leases ready coin or goods with her my lord comes to you nor shall you have one motive to induce you to believe i live too long since every year i'll add something unto the heap which shall be yours too
you are a right kind father
you shall have reason to think me such
how do you like this seat
it is well wooded and well watered the acres fertile and rich would it not serve for change to entertain your friends in a summer progress
what thinks my noble lord
'tis a wholesome air and well built pile and she that's mistress of it worthy the large revénue
it may be so for a time but let my lord say only that he likes it and would have it i say ere long 'tis his
you do conclude too fast not knowing me nor the engines that i work by
‘tis not alone the lady allworth's lands for those once wellborn's as by her dotage on him i know they will be shall soon be mine but point out any man's in all the shire and say they lie convenient and useful for your lordship and once more i say aloud they are yours
i dare not own what's by unjust and cruèl means extorted my fame and credit are more dear to me than so to expose them to be censured by the public voice
you run my lord no hazard
your reputatiön shall stand as fair in all good men's opiniöns as now nor can my actions though condemned for ill cast any foul aspersion upon yours
for though i do contemn report myself as a mere sound i still will be so tender of what concerns you in all points of honour that the immaculate whiteness of your fame nor your unquestiöned integrity shall e'er be sullied with one taint or spot that may take from your innocence and candour
all my ambition is to have my daughter right honourable which my lord can make her and might i live to dance upon my knee a young lord lovell born by her unto you i write nil ultra to my proudest hopes
as for possessiöns and annual rents equivalent to maintain you in the port your noble birth and present state requires i do remove that burthen from your shoulders and take it on mine own for though i ruin the country to supply your riotous waste the scourge of prodigals want shall never find you
are you not frighted with the imprecations and curses of whole families made wretched by your sinister practices
yes as rocks are when foamy billows split themselves against their flinty ribs or as the moon is moved when wolves with hunger pined howl at her brightness
i am of a solid temper and like these steer on a constant course with mine own sword if called into the field i can make that right which fearful enemies murmured at as wrong
now for these other piddling complaints breathed out in bitterness as when they call me extortioner tyrant cormorant or intruder on my poor neighbour's right or grand incloser of what was common to my private use nay when my ears are pierced with widows' cries and undone orphans wash with tears my threshold i only think what 'tis to have my daughter right honourable and 'tis a powerful charm makes me insensible of remorse or pity or the least sting of conscience
i admire the toughness of your nature
'tis for you my lord and for my daughter i am marble nay more if you will have my character in little i enjoy more true delight in my arrival to my wealth these dark and crooked ways than you shall e'er take pleasure in spending what my industry hath compassed
my haste commands me hence in one word therefore is it a match
i hope that is past doubt now
then rest secure not the hate of all mankind here nor fear of what can fall on me hereafter shall make me study aught but your advancement one story higher an earl
if gold can do it
dispute not my religion nor my faith though i am borne thus headlong by my will you may make choice of what belief you please to me they are equal so my lord good morrow
he's gone − i wonder how the earth can bear such a portént
i that have lived a soldier and stood the enemy's violent charge undaunted to hear this blasphemous beast am bathed all over in a cold sweat yet like a mountain he confirmed in atheistical assertions is no more shaken than olympus is when angry boreas loads his double head with sudden drifts of snow
enter lady allworth waiting woman and amble
save you my lord
disturb i not your privacy
no good madam for your own sake i am glad you came no sooner since this bold bad man sir giles overreach made such a plain discovery of himself and read this morning such a devilish matins that i should think it a sin next to his but to repeat it
i ne'er pressed my lord on others' privacies yet against my will walking for health' sake in the gallery adjoining to your lodgings i was made so vehement and loud he was partaker of his tempting offers
please you to command your servants hence and i shall gladly hear your wiser counsel
'tis my lord a woman's but true and hearty − wait in the next room but be within call yet not so near to force me to whisper my intents
we are taught better by you good madam
and well know our distance
do so and talk not 'twill become your breeding
exeunt amble and woman
now my good lord if i may use my freedom as to an honoured friend − lov
you lessen else your favour to me
i dare then say thus as you are noble howe'er common men make sordid wealth the object and sole end of their industrious aims 'twill not agree with those of eminent blood who are engaged more to prefer their honours than to increase the state left to them by their ancestors to study large additions to their fortunes and quite neglect their births − though i must grant riches well got to be a useful servant but a bad master
madam 'tis confessed but what infer you from it
this my lord that as all wrongs though thrust into one scale slide of themselves off when right fills the other and cannot bide the trial so all wealth i mean if ill acquired cemented to honour by virtuous ways achieved and bravely purchased is but as rubbish poured into a river howe'er intended to make good the bank rendering the water that was pure before polluted and unwholesome
i allow the heir of sir giles overreach margaret a maid well qualified and the richest match our north part can make boast of yet she cannot with all that she brings with her fill their mouths that never will forget who was her father or that my husband allworth's lands and wellborn's how wrung from both needs now no repetition were real motives that more worked your lordship to join your families than her form and virtues you may conceive the rest
i do sweet madam and long since have considered it
i know the sum of all that makes a just man happy consists in the well choosing of his wife and there well to discharge it does require equality of years of birth of fortune for beauty being poor and not cried up by birth or wealth can truly mix with neither
and wealth where there's such difference in years and fair descent must make the yoke uneasy − but i come nearer
pray you do my lord
were overreach' states thrice centupled his daughter millions of degrees much fairer than she is howe'er i might urge precedents to excuse me i would not so adulterate my blood by marrying margaret and so leave my issue made up of several pieces one part scarlet and the other london blue
in my own tomb i will inter my name first
aside i am glad to hear this
− why then my lord pretend your marriage to her
dissimulatiön but ties false knots on that straight line by which you hitherto have measured all your actions
i make answer and aptly with a question
wherefore have you that since your husband's death have lived a strict and chaste nun's life on the sudden given yourself to visits and entertainments
think you madam 'tis not grown public conference
or the favours which you too prodigally have thrown on wellborn being too reserved before incur not censure
i am innocent here and on my life i swear my ends are good
on my soul so are mine to margaret but leave both to the event and since this friendly privacy does serve but as an offered means unto ourselves to search each other further you having shewn your care of me i my respect to you deny me not but still in chaste words madam an afternoon's discourse
so i shall hear you
enter tapwell and froth
this was your counsel froth
i defy thee did not master marrall he has marred all i am sure strictly command us on pain of sir giles overreach' displeasure to turn the gentleman out of doors
‘tis true but now he's his uncle's darling and has got master justice greedy since he filled his belly at his commandment to do anything woe woe to us
he may prove merciful
troth we do not deserve it at his hands
though he knew all the passages of our house as the receiving of stolen goods and bawdry when he was rogue wellborn no man would believe him and then his information could not hurt us but now he is right worshipful again who dares but doubt his testimony
methinks i see thee froth already in a cart for a close bawd thine eyes even pelted out with dirt and rotten eggs and my hand hissing if i scape the halter with the letter r printed upon it
would that were the worst
that were but nine days wonder as for credit we have none to lose but we shall lose the money he owes us and his custom there's the hell on't
he has summoned all his creditors by the drum and they swarm about him like so many soldiers on the pay day and has found out such a as 'tis very likely he shall be chronicled for it
he deserves it more than ten pageants
but are you sure his worship comes this way to my lady's
a cry within brave master wellborn
yes − i hear him
be ready with your petition and present it to his good grace
enter wellborn in a rich habit followed by marrall greedy order furnace and creditors tapwell kneeling delivers his petition
− but note what miracles the payment of a little trash and a rich suit of clothes can work upon these rascals
i shall be i think prince wellborn
when your worship's married you may be − i know what i hope to see you
then look thou for advancement
to be known your worship's bailiff is the mark i shoot at
and thou shalt hit it
pray you sir dispatch these needy followers and for my admittance provided you'll defend me from sir giles whose service i am weary of i'll say something you shall give thanks for
fear me not sir giles
i remember thy wife brought me last new year's tide a couple of fat turkeys
and shall do every christmas let your worship but stand my friend now
i can do anything with him on such terms
− see you this honest couple they are good souls as ever drew out fosset have they not a pair of honest faces
i o'erheard you and the bribe he promised
you are cozened in them for of all the scum that grew rich by my riots this for a most unthankful knave and this for a base bawd and whore have worst deserved me and therefore speak not for them by your place you are rather to do me justice lend me your ear − forget his turkeys and call in his license and at the next fair i'll give you a yoke of oxen worth all his poultry
i am changed on the sudden in my opinion
come near nearer rascal
and now i view him better did you e'er see one look so like an archknave
his very countenance should an understanding judge but look upon him would hang him though he were innocent
no though the great turk came instead of turkeys to beg my favour i am inexorable
thou hast an ill name besides thy musty ale that hath destroyed many of the king's liege people thou never hadst in thy house to stay men's stomachs
a piece of suffolk cheese or gammon of bacon or any esculent as the learned call it for their emolument but sheer drink only
for which gross fault i here do damn thy license forbidding thee ever to tap or draw for instantly i will in mine own person command the constable to pull down thy sign and do it before i eat
if i shew any may my promised oxen gore me
unthankful knaves are ever so rewarded
exeunt greedy tapwell and froth
speak what are you
a decayed vintner sir that might have thrived but that your worship broke me with trusting you with muskadine and eggs and five pound suppers with your after drinkings when you lodged upon the bankside
i have not been hasty nor e'er laid to arrest you and therefore sir − well
thou art an honest fellow i'll set thee up again see his bill paid
− what are you
a tailor once but now mere botcher
i gave you credit for a suit of clothes which was all my stock but you failing in payment i was removed from the shopboard and confined under a stall
see him paid and botch no more
i ask no interest sir
such tailors need not if their bills are paid in one and twenty year they are seldom losers
− to rd creditor o i know thy face thou wert my surgeon you must tell no tales those days are done
i will pay you in private
royal as an emperor
he'll prove a brave master my good lady knew to choose a man
see all men else discharged and since old debts are cleared by a new way a little bounty will not misbecome me there's something honest cook for thy good breakfasts to order and this for your respect take't 'tis good gold and i able to spare it
you are too munificent
he was ever so
pray you on before
at four o'clock the rest know where to meet me
exeunt order furnace and creditors
now master marrall what's the weighty secret you promised to impart
sir time nor place allow me to relate each circumstance this only in a word i know sir giles will come upon you for security for his thousand pounds which you must not consent to
as he grows in heat as i am sure he will be you but rough and say he's in your debt ten times the sum upon sale of your land i had a hand in't i speak it to my shame when you were defeated of it
i shall deserve it then urge him to produce the deed in which you passed it over to him which i know he'll have about him to deliver to the lord lovell with many other writings and present monies i'll instruct you further as i wait on your worship if i play not my prize to your full content and your uncle's much vexation hang up jack marrall
i rely upon thee
a room in overreach's house
enter allworth and margaret
whether to yield the first praise to my lord's unequalled temperance or your constant sweetness that i yet live my weak hands fastened on hope's anchor spite of all storms of despair i yet rest doubtful
give it to lord lovell for what in him was bounty in me's duty
i make but payment of a debt to which my vows in that high office registered are faithful witnesses
tis true my dearest yet when i call to mind how many fair ones make wilful shipwreck of their faiths and oaths to god and man to fill the arms of greatness and you rise up no less than a glorious star to the amazement of the world − hold out against the stern authority of a father and spurn at honour when it comes to court you i am so tender of your good that faintly with your wrong i can wish myself that right you yet are pleased to do me
to me what's title when content is wanting
or wealth raked up together with much care and to be kept with more when the heart pines in being dispossessed of what it longs for beyond the indian mines
or the smooth brow of a pleased sire that slaves me to his will and so his ravenous humour may be feasted by my obedience and he see me great leaves to my soul nor faculties nor power to make her own election
but the dangers that follow the repulse − marg
to me they are nothing let allworth love i cannot be unhappy
suppose the worst that in his rage he kill me a tear or two by you dropt on my hearse in sorrow for my fate will call back life so far as but to say that i die yours i then shall rest in peace or should he prove so cruèl as one death would not suffice his thirst of vengeance but with lingering torments in mind and body i must waste to air in poverty joined with banishment so you share in my afflictions which i dare not wish you so high i prize you i could undergo them with such a patiënce as should look down with scorn on his worst malice
heaven avert such trials of your true affection to me
nor will it unto you that are all mercy shew so much rigour but since we must run such desperate hazards let us do our best to steer between them
your lord's ours and sure and though but a young actor second me in doing to the life what he has plotted enter overreach behind
the end may yet prove happy
to your letter and put on a seeming anger
i'll pay my lord all debts due to his title and when with terms not taking from his honour he does solicit me i shall gladly hear him
but in this peremptory nay commanding way to appoint a meeting and without my knowledge a priest to tie the knot can ne'er be undone till death unloose it is a confidence in his lordship will deceive him
i hope better good lady
hope sir what you please for me i must take a safe and secure course i have a father and without his full consent though all lords of the land kneeled for my favour i can grant nothing
i like this obedience comes forward
but whatsoe'er my lord writes must and shall be accepted and embraced
sweet master allworth you shew yourself a true and faithful servant to your good lord he has a jewel of you
are these looks to receive a messenger from my lord
a piece of arrogant paper like the inscriptions
reads "fair mistress from your servant learn all joys that we can hope for if deferred prove toys therefore this instant and in private meet a husband that will gladly at your feet lay down his honours tendering them to you with all content the church being paid her due
" − is this the arrogant piece of paper
will you still be one
in the name of madness what could his good honour write more to content you
is there aught else to be wished after these two that are already offered marriage first and lawful pleasure after what would you more
why sir i would be married like your daughter not hurried away i' the night i know not whither without all ceremony no friends invited to honour the solemnity
an't please your honour for so before to morrow i must style you my lord desires this privacy in respect his honourable kinsmen are afar off and his desires to have it done brook not so long delay as to expect their coming and yet he stands resolved with all due pomp as running at the ring plays masks and tilting
to have his marriage at court celebrated when he has brought your honour up to london
he tells you true 'tis the fashion on my knowledge yet the good lord to please your peevishness must put it off forsooth
and lose a night in which perhaps he might get two boys on thee
tempt me no further if you do this goad points to his sword
shall prick you to him
i could be contented were you but by to do a father's part and give me in the church
so my lord have you what do i care who gives you
since my lord does purpose to be private i'll not cross him
i know not master allworth how my lord may be provided and therefore there's a purse of gold 'twill serve this night's expense to morrow i'll furnish him with any sums in the mean time use my ring to my chaplain he is beneficed at my manor of got'em and called parson willdo 'tis no matter for a licence i'll bear him out in't
with your favour sir what warrant is your ring
he may suppose i got that twenty ways without your knowledge and then to be refused were such a stain upon me
− if you pleased sir your presence would do better
i say again i will not cross my lord yet i'll prevent you too
− paper and ink there
i can furnish you
i thank you i can write then
you may if you please put out the name of my lord in respect he comes disguised and only write "marry her to this gentleman
tis done away − margaret kneels
nay no reply be gone − good master allworth this shall be the best night's work you ever made
i hope so sir
exeunt allworth and margaret
− now all's cocksure methinks i hear already knights and ladies say sir giles overreach how is it with your honourable daughter
has her honour slept well to night
or will her honour please to accept this monkey dog or paroquito this is state in ladies or my eldest son to be her page and wait upon her trencher
my ends my ends are compassed − then for wellborn and the lands were he once married to the widow − i have him here − i can scarce contain myself i am so full of joy nay joy all over
a room in lady allworth's house
enter lord lovell lady allworth and amble
by this you know how strong the motives were that did my lord induce me to dispense a little with my gravity to advance in personating some few favours to him the plots and projects of the down trod wellborn
nor shall i e'er repent although i suffer in some few men's opinions for't the action for he that ventured all for my dear husband might justly claim an obligation from me to pay him such a courtesy which had i coyly or over curiously denied it might have argued me of little love to the deceased
what you intended madam for the poor gentleman hath found good success for as i understand his debts are paid and he once more furnished for fair employment but all the arts that i have used to raise the fortunes of your joy and mine young allworth stand yet in supposition though i hope well for the young lovers are in wit more pregnant than their years can promise and for their desires on my knowledge they are equal
as my wishes are with yours my lord yet give me leave to fear the building though well grounded to deceive sir giles that's both a lion and a fox in his proceedings were a work beyond the strongest undertakers not the trial of two weak innocents
despair not madam hard things are compassed oft by easy means and judgment being a gift derived from heaven though sometimes lodged in the hearts of worldly men that ne'er consider from whom they receive it forsakes such as abuse the giver of it
which is the reason that the politic and cunning statesman that believes he fathoms the counsels of all kingdoms on the earth is by simplicity oft over reached
may he be so
yet in his name to express it is a good omen
may it to myself prove so good lady in my suit to you
what think you of the motion
troth my lord my own unworthiness may answer for me for had you when that i was in my prime my virgin flower uncropped presented me with this great favour looking on my lowness not in a glass of self love but of truth i could not but have thought it as a blessing far far beyond my merit
you are too modest and undervalue that which is above my title or whatever i call mine
i grant were i a spaniard to marry a widow might disparage me but being a true born englishman i cannot find how it can taint my honour nay what's more that which you think a blemish is to me the fairest lustre
you already madam have given sure proofs how dearly you can cherish a husband that deserves you which confirms me that if i am not wanting in my care to do you service you'll be still the same that you were to your allworth in a word our years our states our births are not unequal you being descended nobly and allied so if then you may be won to make me happy but join your lips to mine and that shall be a solemn contract
i were blind to my own good should i refuse it kisses him
yet my lord receive me as such a one the study of whose whole life shall know no other object but to please you
if i return not with all tenderness equal respect to you may i die wretched
there needs no protestatiön my lord to her that cannot doubt
− enter wellborn handsomely apparelled
you are welcome sir
now you look like yourself
and will continue such in my free acknowledgment that i am your creature madam and will never hold my life mine own when you please to command it
it is a thankfulness that well becomes you you could not make choice of a better shape to dress your mind in
for me i am happy that my endeavours prospered
saw you of late sir giles your uncle
i heard of him madam by his minister marrall he's grown into strange passions about his daughter this last night he looked for your lordship at his house but missing you and she not yet appearing his wise head is much perplexed and troubled
it may be sweetheart my project took
find her booby thou huge lump of nothing i'll bore thine eyes out else
may it please your lordship for some ends of mine own but to withdraw a little out of sight though not of hearing you may perhaps have sport
you shall direct me
enter overreach with distracted looks driving in marrall before him with a box
i shall sol fa you rogue
sir for what cause do you use me thus
why i am angry and thou a subject only fit for beating and so to cool my choler
look to the writing let but the seal be broke upon the box that has slept in my cabinet these three years i'll rack thy soul for't
aside i may yet cry quittance though now i suffer and dare not resist
lady by your leave did you see my daughter lady
and the lord her husband
are they in your house
if they are discover that i may bid them joy and as an entrance to her place of honour see your ladyship on her left hand and make courtsies when she nods on you which you must receive as a special favour
when i know sir giles her state requires such ceremony i shall pay it but in the meantime as i am myself i give you to understand i neither know nor care where her honour is
when you once see her supported and led by the lord her husband you'll be taught better
'tis all i owe you
have your redeemed rags made you thus insolent
why what are you sir unless in your years at the best more than myself
aside his fortune swells him 'tis rank he's married
sir in calm language though i seldom use it i am familiar with the cause that makes you bear up thus bravely there's a certain buzz of a stolen marriage do you hear
of a stolen marriage in which 'tis said there's somebody hath been cozened i name no parties
well sir and what follows
marry this since you are peremptory
remember upon mere hope of your great match i lent you a thousand pounds put me in good security and suddenly by mortgage or by statute of some of your new possessions or i'll have you dragged in your lavender robes to the gaol you know me and therefore do not trifle
can you be so cruèl to your nephew now he's in the way to rise
was this the courtesy you did me "in pure love and no ends else
end me no ends
engage the whole estate and force your spouse to sign it you shall have three or four thousand more to roar and swagger and revel in bawdy taverns
and beg after mean you not so
my thoughts are mine and free
shall i have security
no indeed you shall not nor bond nor bill nor bare acknowledgment your great looks fright not me
but my deeds shall
let him come on with all his wrongs and injuries about him armed with his cut throat practices to guard him the right that i bring with me will defend me and punish his extortion
that i had thee but single in the field
you may but make not my house your quarrelling scene
were't in a church by heaven and hell i'll do't
aside to wellborn now put him to the shewing of the deed
this rage is vain sir for fighting fear not you shall have your hands full upon the least incitement and whereas you charge me with a debt of a thousand pounds if there be law howe'er you have no conscience either restore my land or i'll recover a debt that's truly due to me from you in value ten times more than what you challenge
i in thy debt
did i not purchase the land left by thy father that rich land
that had continuèd in wellborn's name twenty descents which like a riotous fool thou didst make sale of
is not here inclosed the deed that does confirm it mine
i do acknowledge none i ne'er passed over any such land i grant for a year or two you had it in trust which if you do discharge surrendering the possession you shall ease yourself and me of chargeable suits in law which if you prove not honest as i doubt it must of necessity follow
in my judgment he does advise you well
conspire with your new husband lady second him in his dishonest practices but when this manor is extended to my use you'll speak in an humbler key and sue for favour
never do not hope it
let despair first seize me
yet to shut up thy mouth and make thee give thyself the lie the loud lie i draw out the precious evidence if thou canst forswear thy hand and seal and make a forfeit of thy ears to the pillory opens the box and displays the bond
here's that will make my interest clear − ha
a fair skin of parchment
indented i confess and labels too but neither wax nor words
not a syllable to insult with
my wise uncle is this your precious evidence this that makes your interest clear
i am o'erwhelmed with wonder
what prodigy is this
what subtle devil hath razed out the inscription
the wax turned into dust
− the rest of my deeds whole as when they were delivered and this only made nothing
do you deal with witches rascal
there is a statute for you which will bring your neck in an hempen circle yes there is and now 'tis better thought for cheater know this juggling shall not save you
to save thee would beggar the stock of mercy
aside to marrall though the witnesses are dead your testimony help with an oath or two and for thy master thy liberal master my good honest servant i know thou wilt swear anything to dash this cunning sleight besides i know thou art a public notary and such stand in law for a dozen witnesses the deed being drawn too by thee my careful marrall and delivered when thou wert present will make good my title
wilt thou not swear this
no i assure you i have a conscience not seared up like yours i know no deeds
wilt thou betray me
keep him from using of his hands i'll use my tongue to his no little torment
mine own varlet rebel against me
yes and uncase you too
"the idiot the patch the slave the booby the property fit only to be beaten for your morning exercise" your "football or "the unprofitable lump of flesh" your "drudge" can now anatomise you and lay open all your black plots and level with the earth your hill of pride and with these gabions guarded unload my great artillery and shake nay pulverize the walls you think defend you
how he foams at the mouth with rage
o that i had thee in my gripe i would tear thee joint after joint
i know you are a tearer but i'll have first your fangs pared off and then come nearer to you when i have discovered and made it good before the judge what ways and devilish practices you used to cozen with an army of whole families who yet alive and but enrolled for soldiers were able to take in dunkirk
all will come out
but that i will live rogue to torture thee and make thee wish and kneel in vain to die these swords that keep thee from me should fix here although they made my body but one wound but i would reach thee
aside heaven's hand is in this one bandog worry the other
i play the fool and make my anger but ridiculous there will be a time and place there will be cowards when you shall feel what i dare do
i think so you dare do any ill yet want true valour to be honest and repent
they are words i know not
nor e'er will learn
patience the beggar's virtue shall find no harbour here enter greedy and parson willdo
− after these storms at length a calm appears
there's comfort in thy looks is the deed done
is my daughter married
say but so my chaplain and i am tame
yes i assure you
then vanish all sad thoughts
there's more gold for thee
my doubts and fears are in the titles drowned of my honourable my right honourable daughter
here will be feasting
at least for a month i am provided empty guts croak no more
you shall be stuffed like bagpipes not with wind but bearing dishes
whispering to willdo instantly be here
− now you that plot against me and hoped to trip my heels up that contemned me think on't and tremble − loud music
i hear the music
a lane there for my lord
this sudden heat may yet be cooled sir
make way there for my lord
enter allworth and margaret
sir first your pardon then your blessing with your full allowance of the choice i have made
as ever you could make use of your reason kneeling
grow not in passion since you may as well call back the day that's past as untie the knot which is too strongly fastened not to dwell too long on words this is my husband
so i assure you all the rites of marriage with every circumstance are past
sir although i am no lord but a lord's page your daughter and my loved wife mourns not for it and for right honourable son in law you may say your dutiful daughter
do a father's part and say "heaven give them joy
speak and speak quickly or thou art dead
thou hadst better have made a contract with the king of fiends than these − my brain turns
why this rage to me
is not this your letter sir and these the words
"marry her to this gentleman
it cannot − nor will i e'er believe it 'sdeath
i will not that i that in all passages i touched at worldly profit have not left a print where i have trod for the most curious search to trace my footsteps should be gulled by children baffled and fooled and all my hopes and labours defeated and made void
as it appears you are so my grave uncle
village nurses revenge their wrongs with curses i'll not waste a syllable but thus i take the life which wretched i gave to thee
attempts to kill margaret
coming forward hold for your own sake
though charity to your daughter hath quite left you will you do an act though in your hopes lost here can leave no hope for peace or rest hereafter
consider at the best you are but a man and cannot so create your aims but that they may be crossed
thus i spit at thee and at thy counsel and again desire thee and as thou art a soldier if thy valour dares shew itself where multitude and example lead not the way let's quit the house and change six words in private
stay sir contest with one distracted
you'll grow like him should you answer his vain challenge
borrow his help though hercules call it odds i'll stand against both as i am hemmed in – thus
since like a libyan lion in the toil my fury cannot reach the coward hunters and only spends itself i'll quit the place alone i can do nothing but i have servants and friends to second me and if i make not this house a heap of ashes by my wrongs what i have spoke i will make good
or leave one throat uncut − if it be possible hell add to my afflictions
is't not brave sport
i am sure it has ta'en away my stomach i do not like the sauce
nay weep not dearest though it express your pity what's decreed above we cannot alter
his threats move me no scruple madam
was it not a rare trick an it please your worship to make the deed nothing
i can do twenty neater if you please to purchase and grow rich for i will be such a solicitor and steward for you as never worshipful had
i do believe thee but first discover the quaint means you used to raze out the conveyance
they are mysteries not to be spoke in public certain minerals incorporated in the ink and wax − besides he gave me nothing but still fed me with hopes and blows and that was the inducement to this conundrum
if it please your worship to call to memory this mad beast once caused me to urge you or to drown or hang yourself i'll do the like to him if you command me
you are a rascal
he that dares be false to a master though unjust will ne'er be true to any other
look not for reward or favour from me i will shun thy sight as i would do a basilisk's thank my pity if thou keep thy ears howe'er i will take order your practice shall be silenced
i'll commit him if you'll have me sir
that were to little purpose his conscience be his prison
− not a word but instantly be gone
take this kick with you
if that i had my cleaver here i would divide your knave's head
this is the haven false servants still arrive at
fear not i am your guard
his looks are ghastly
some little time i have spent under your favours in physical studies and if my judgment err not he's mad beyond recovery but observe him and look to yourselves
why is not the whole world included in myself
to what use then are friends and servants
say there were a squadron of pikes lined through with shot when i am mounted upon my injuries shall i fear to charge them
no i'll through the battalia and that routed flourishing his sword sheathed
i'll fall to execution
i am feeble some undone widow sits upon mine arm and takes away the use of 't and my sword glued to my scabbard with wronged orphans' tears will not be drawn
sure hangmen that come to bind my hands and then to drag me before the judgment seat now they are new shapes and do appear like furies with steel whips to scourge my ulcerous soul
shall i then fall ingloriously and yield
no spite of fate i will be forced to hell like to myself
though you were legions of accursèd spirits thus would i fly among you
rushes forward and flings himself on the ground
there's no help disarm him first then bind him
take a mittimus and carry him to bedlam
and bites the earth
carry him to some dark room there try what art can do for his recovery
o my dear father
they force overreach off
you must be patient mistress
here is a precedent to teach wicked men that when they leave religion and turn atheists their own abilities leave them
− pray you take comfort i will endeavour you shall be his guardians in his distractions − and for your land master wellborn be it good or ill in law i'll be an umpire between you and this the undoubted heir of sir giles overreach for me here's the anchor that i must fix on
what you shall determine my lord i will allow of
'tis the language that i speak too but there is something else beside the repossession of my land and payment of my debts that i must practise
i had a reputation but 'twas lost in my loose course and until i redeem it some noble way i am but half made up
it is a time of action if your lordship will please to confer a company upon me in your command i doubt not in my service to my king and country but i shall do something that may make me right again
your suit is granted and you loved for the motion
coming forward nothing wants then but your allowance − and in that our all is comprehended it being known nor we nor he that wrote the comedy can be free without your manumission which if you grant willingly as a fair favour due to the poet's and our labours as you may for we despair not gentlemen of the play we jointly shall profess your grace hath might to teach us action and him how to write
