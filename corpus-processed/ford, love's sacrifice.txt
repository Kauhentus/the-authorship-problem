pavia a room in the palace of the duke of pavia
enter roseilli and roderico d’avolos
such was the duke's command
you'ar secretary to the state and him great in his counsels wise and i think honest
have you in turning over old recórds read but one name descended of the house of lesui in his loyalty remiss
why then should i now now when glorious peace triumphs in change of pleasures be wiped off like to a useless moth from courtly ease
− and whither must i go
you have the open world before you
why then 'tis like i'm banished
not so my warrant is only to command you from the court within five hours to depart after notice taken and not to live within thirty miles of it until it be thought meet by his excellence to call you back
now i have warned you my lord at your peril be it if you disobey
i shall inform the duke of your discontent
i scent the plot of this disgrace 'tis fiormonda she that glorious widow whose commanding check ruins my love like foolish beasts thus they find danger that prey too near the lions' den
enter fernando and petruchio
my noble lord roseilli
sir the joy i should have welcomed you with is wrapt up in clouds of my disgrace yet honoured sir howsoever frowns of great ones cast me down my service shall pay tribute in my lowness to your uprising virtues
sir i know you are so well acquainted with your own you need not flatter mine trust me my lord i'll be a suitor for you
and i'll second my nephew's suit with importunity
you are my lord fernando late returned from travels pray instruct me − since the voice of most supreme authority commands my absence i determine to bestow some time in learning languages abroad perhaps the change of air may change in me remembrance of my wrongs at home good sir inform me say i meant to live in spain what benefit of knowledge might i treasure
troth sir i'll freely speak as i have found
in spain you lose experience 'tis a climate too hot to nourish arts the nation proud and in their pride unsociable the court more pliable to glorify itself than do a stranger grace if you intend to traffic like a merchant 'twere a place might better much your trade but as for me i soon took surfeit on it
france i more praise and love
you are my lord yourself for horsemanship much famed and there you shall have many proofs to shew your skill
the french are passing courtly ripe of wit kind but extreme dissemblers you shall have a frenchman ducking lower than your knee at th' instant mocking even your very shoe ties
to give the country due it is on earth a paradise and if you can neglect your own appropriaments but praising that in others wherein you excel yourself you shall be much belovèd there
yet methought i heard you and the duchess two nights since discoursing of an island thereabouts called − let me think − 'twas − ferna
that pray sir − you have been there methought i heard you praise it
i'll tell you what i found there men as neat as courtly as the french but in condition quite opposite
put case that you my lord could be more rare on horseback than you are if there − as there are many − one excelled you in your art as much as you do others yet will the english think their own is nothing compared with you a stranger in their habits they are not more fantastic than uncertain in short their fair abundance manhood beauty no nation can disparage but itself
my lord you have much eased me i resolve
and whither are you bent
my lord for travel to speed for england
no my lord you must not i have yet some private conference to impart unto you for your good at night i'll meet you at my lord petruchio's house till then be secret
dares my cousin trust me
dare i my lord
yes 'less your fact were greater than a bold woman's spleen
the duke's at hand and i must hence my service to your lordships
now nephew as i told you since the duke hath held the reins of state in his own hand much altered from the man he was before − as if he were transformèd in his mind − to soothe him in his pleasures amongst whom is fond ferentes one whose pride takes pride in nothing more than to delight his lust and he − with grief i speak it − hath i fear too much besotted my unhappy daughter my poor colona whom for kindred's sake as you are noble as you honour virtue persuade to love herself a word from you may win her more than my entreaties or frowns
uncle i'll do my best meantime pray tell me whose mediation wrought the marriäge betwixt the duke and duchess
his roving eye and her enchanting face the only dower nature had ordained advance her to her bride bed
she was daughter unto a gentleman of milan − no better − preferred to serve in the duke of mílan's court where for her beauty she was greatly famed and passing late from thence to monaco to visit there her uncle paul baglione the abbot fortune − queen to such blind matches − presents her to the duke's eye on the way as he pursues the deer in short my lord he saw her loved her wooed her won her matched her no counsel could divert him
she is and to speak truth i think right noble in her conditions
if when i should choose beauty and virtue were the fee proposed i should not pass for parentage
the duke doth come
let's break off talk
− aside if ever now good angel of my soul protect my truth
enter the duke bianca fiormonda nibrassa ferentes julia and d’avolos
come my bianca revel in mine arms whiles i rapt in my admiration view lilies and roses growing in thy cheeks
o thou half myself
no joy could make my pleasures full without thy presence i am a monarch of felicity proud in a pair of jewëls rich and beautiful − a perfect friend a wife above compare
sir if a man so low in rank may hope by loyal duty and devoted zeal to hold a correspondency in friendship with one so mighty as the duke of pavy my uttermost ambition is to climb to those deserts may give the style of servant
of partner in my dukedom in my heart as freely as the privilege of blood hath made them mine philippo and fernando shall be without distinction
− look bianca on this good man in all respects to him be as to me only the name of husband and reverent observance of our bed shall differ us in persons else in soul we are all one
i shall in best of love regard the bosom partner of my lord
aside to ferentes ferentes − feren
aside to fiormonda madam
aside to ferentes you are one loves courtship he had some change of words 'twere no lost labour to stuff your table books the man speaks wisely
aside to fiormonda i'm glad your highness is so pleasant
my lord and brother
you are too silent quicken your sad remembrance though the loss of your dead husband be of more account than slight neglect yet 'tis a sin against the state of princes to exceed a mean in mourning for the dead
should form my lord prevail above affection
you have yourself here a right noble duchess virtuous at least and should your grace now pay − which heaven forbid
− the debt you owe to nature i dare presume she'd not so soon forget a prince that thus advanced her
− madam could you
aside bitter and shrewd
to fiornonda sister i should too much bewray my weakness to give a resolution on a passion i never felt nor feared
if credit may be given to a face my lord i'll undertake on her behalf her words are trusty heralds to her mind
aside to d’avolos exceeding good the man will "undertake"
aside to fiormonda i do lady 'tis a smooth praise
friend in thy judgment i approve thy love and love thee better for thy judging mine
though my gray headed senate in the laws of strict opinion and severe dispute would tie the limits of our free affects − like superstitious jews − to match with none but in a tribe of princes like ourselves − gross nurtured slaves who force their wretched souls to crouch to profit nay for trash and wealth dote on some crooked or misshapen form hugging wise nature's lame deformity begetting creatures ugly as themselves − but why should princes do so that command the storehouse of the earth's hid minerals
− no my bianca thou art to me as dear as if thy portion had been europe's riches since in thine eyes lies more than these are worth
− set on they shall be strangers to my heart that envy thee thy fortunes
− come fernando my but divided self what we have done we are only debtor to heaven for
aside to d'avolos now take thy time or never d'avolos prevail and i will raise thee high in grace
aside to fiormonda madam i will omit no art
exeunt all but d’avolos who stays fernando
my honoured lord fernando
let me beseech your lordship to excuse me in the nobleness of your wisdom if i exceed good manners i am one my lord who in the admiration of your perfect virtues do so truly honour and reverence your deserts that there is not a creature bears life shall more faithfully study to do you service in all offices of duty and vows of due respect
good sir you bind me to you is this all
i beseech your ear a little good my lord what i have to speak concerns your reputation and best fortune
lay aside superfluous ceremony speak what is't
i do repute myself the blessedest man alive that i shall be the first gives your lordship news of your perpetual comfort
if singular beauty unimitable virtues honour youth and absolute goodness be a fortune all those are at once offered to your particular choice
without delays which way
the great and gracious lady fiormonda loves you infinitely loves you
− but my lord as ever you tendered a servant to your pleasures let me not be revealed that i gave you notice on't
sure you are strangely out of tune sir
please but to speak to her be but courtlyceremonious with her use once but the language of affection − if i misreport aught besides my knowledge let me never have place in your good opinion
o these women my lord are as brittle metal as your glasses as smooth as slippery − their very first substance was quicksands let 'em look never so demurely one fillip chokes them
my lord she loves you i know it
− but i beseech your lordship not to discover me i would not for the world she should know that you know it by me
i understand you and to thank your care will study to requite it and i vow she never shall have notice of your news by me or by my means
and worthy sir let me alike enjoin you not to speak a word of that i understand her love and as for me my word shall be your surety i'll not as much as give her cause to think i ever heard it
nay my lord whatsoever i infer you may break with her in it if you please for rather than silence should hinder you one step to such a fortune i will expose myself to any rebuke for your sake my good lord
you shall not indeed sir i am still your friend and will prove so
for the present i am forced to attend the duke good hours befall ye
i must leave you
'sfoot i ha' marred all
this is worse and worse he's as cold as hemlock
if her highness knows how i have gone to work she'll thank me scurvily a pox of all dull brains
i took the clean contrary course
there is a mystery in this slight carelessness of his i must sift it and i will find it
ud's me fool myself out of my wit
well i'll choose some fitter opportunity to inveigle him and till then smooth her up that he is a man overjoyed with the report
i another room in the palace
enter ferentes and colona
madam by this light i vow myself your servant only yours inespecially yours
time like a turncoat may order and disorder the outward fashions of our bodies but shall never enforce a change on the constancy of my mind
sweet colona fair colona young and sprightful lady do not let me in the best of my youth languish in my earnest affections
why should you seek my lord to purchase glory by the disgrace of a silly maid
that i confess too
i am every way so unworthy of the first fruits of thy embraces so far beneath the riches of thy merit that it can be no honour to thy fame to rank me in the number of thy servants yet prove me how true how firm i will stand to thy pleasures to thy command and as time shall serve be ever thine
now prithee dear colona − col
well well my lord i have no heart of flint or if i had you know by cunning words how to outwear it − but − feren
do not pity thy own gentleness lovely colona
shall − say but "ay" and our wishes are made up
how shall i say "ay" when my fears say "no"
you will not fail to meet me two hours hence sweet
no − yes yes i would have said how my tongue trips
i take that promise and that double "yes" as an assurance of thy faith
in the grove good sweet remember in any case alone − d'ee mark love
– not as much as your duchess' little dog − you'll not forget
− two hours hence − think on't and miss not till then − col
o if you should prove false and love another
i'll be all thine and a servant only to thee only to thee
− very passing good
three honest women in our courts here of italy are enough to discredit a whole nation of that sex
he that is not a cuckold or a bastard is a strangely happy man for a chaste wife or a mother that never stepped awry are wonders wonders in italy
i have got the feat on't and am every day more active in my trade 'tis a sweet sin this slip of mortality and i have tasted enough for one passion of my senses
− here comes more work for me
and how does my own julia
mew upon this sadness
what's the matter you are melancholy
− whither away wench
'tis well the time has been when your smooth tongue would not have mocked my griefs and had i been more chary of mine honour you had still been lowly as you were
why i am sure i cannot be much more lowly than i am to thee thou bring'st me on my bare knees wench twice in every four and twenty hours besides half turns instead of bevers
what must we next do sweetheart
break vows on your side i expect no other but every day look when some newer choice may violate your honour and my trust
how shay by that la
i hope i neglect no opportunity to your nunquam satis to be called in question for
go thou art as fretting as an old grogram by this hand i love thee for't it becomes thee so prettily to be angry
well if thou shouldst die farewell all love with me forever
go i'll meet thee soon in thy lady's back lobby i will wench look for me
but shall i be resolved you will be mine
all thine i will reserve my best ability my heart my honour only to thee only to thee
− pity of my blood away
i hear company coming on remember soon i am all thine i will live perpetually only to thee away
i wonder about what time of the year i was begot sure it was when the moon was in conjunction and all the other planets drunk at a morris dance i am haunted above patience my mind is not as infinite to do as my occasions are proffered of doing
i am an eunuch if i think there be any such thing or if there be 'tis amongst us men for i never found it in a woman throughly tempted yet
i have a shrewd hard task coming on but let it pass
− who comes now
my lord the duke's friend
i will strive to be inward with him
my noble lord fernando
my lord ferentes i should change some words of consequence with you but since i am for this time busied in more serious thoughts i'll pick some fitter opportunity
i will wait your pleasure my lord
good day to your lordship
− whither shall i run that lost to reason cannot sway the float of the unruly faction in my blood
the duchess oh the duchess
in her smiles are all my joys abstracted
− death to my thoughts
my other plague comes to me
enter fiormonda and julia
my lord fernando what so hard at study
you are a kind companion to yourself that love to be alone so
madam no i rather chose this leisure to admire the glories of this little world the court where like so many stars on several thrones beauty and greatness shine in proper orbs sweet matter for my meditatiön
− leave us julia exit julia
− your own proof by travel and prompt observatiön instruct you how to place the use of speech
− but since you are at leisure pray let's sit we'll pass the time a little in discourse
what have you seen abroad
no wonders lady like these i see at home
your pardon if my tongue the voice of truth report but what is warranted by sight
look in your glass and you shall see a miracle
your beauty so far above all beauties else abroad as you are in your own superlative
your wit hath too much edge
would that or any thing that i could challenge mine were but of value to express how much i serve in love the sister of my prince
'tis for your prince's sake then not for mine
for you in him and much for him in you
i must acknowledge madam i observe in your affects a thing to me most strange which makes me so much honour you the more
gladly lady i see how opposite to youth and custom you set before you in the tablature of your remembrance the becoming griefs of a most loyal lady for the loss of so renowned a prince as was your lord
now good my lord no more of him
i know it is a needless task in me to set him forth in his deservèd praise you better can record it for you find how much more he exceeded other men in most heroic virtues of account so much more was your loss in losing him
his praise should be a field too large too spacious for so mean an orator as i to range in
sir enough 'tis true he well deserved your labour
on his deathbed this ring he gave me bade me never part with this but to the man i loved as dearly as i loved him yet since you know which way to blaze his worth so rightly in return to your deserts wear this for him and me
offers him the ring
methought you said he charged you not to impart it but to him you loved as dearly as you loved him
true i said so ferna
o then far be it my unhallowed hand with any rude intrusion should annul a testament enacted by the dead
why man that testament is disannulled and cancelled quite by us that live
look here my blood is not yet freezed for better instance be judge yourself experience is no danger − cold are my sighs but feel my lips are warm
what means the virtuous marquess
to new kiss the oath to thee which whiles he lived was his hast thou yet power to love
to meet sweetness of language in discourse as sweet
madam 'twere dulness past the ignorance of common blockheads not to understand whereto this favour tends and 'tis a fortune so much above my fate that i could wish no greater happiness on earth but know long since i vowed to live a single life
what was't you said
i said i made a vow − enter bianca petruchio colona and d'avolos
mischief on this interruption
my lord fernando you encounter fitly i have a suit t'ee
'tis my duty madam to be commanded
since my lord the duke is now disposed to mirth the time serves well for mediation that he would be pleased to take the lord roseilli to his grace
he is a noble gentleman i dare engage my credit loyal to the state − to fiormonda and sister one that ever strove methought by special service and obsequious care to win respect from you it were a part of gracious favour if you pleased to join with us in being suitors to the duke for his return to court
" indeed you have some cause to speak he undertook most champion like to win the prize at tilt in honour of your picture marry did he
there's not a groom o' the querry could have matched the jolly riding man pray get him back i do not need his service madam bian
not need it sister
why i hope you think 'tis no necessity in me to move it more than respect of honour
honour is talked of more than known by some
sister these words i understand not
aside swell not unruly thoughts
− to bianca madam the motion you propose proceeds from the true touch of goodness 'tis a plea wherein my tongue and knee shall jointly strive to beg his highness for roseilli's cause
your judgment rightly speaks him there is not in any court of christendom a man for quality or trust more absolute
i shall forever bless your highness for your gracious kind esteem of my disheartened kinsman and to add encouragement to what you undertake i dare affirm ‘tis no important fault hath caused the duke’s distaste
i hope so too
let your highness and you all my lords take advice how you motion his excellency on roseilli's behalf there is more danger in that man than is fit to be publicly reported
i could wish things were otherwise for his own sake but i'll assure ye you will exceedingly alter his excellency's disposition he now is in if you but mention the name of roseilli to his ear i am so much acquainted in the process of his actions
if it be so i am the sorrier sir i'm loth to move my lord unto offence yet i'll adventure chiding
aside oh had i india's gold i'd give it all exchange one private word one minute's breath with this heart wounding beauty
enter the duke ferentes and nibrassa
prithee no more ferentes by the faith i owe to honour thou hast made me laugh beside my spleen
− fernando hadst thou heard the pleasant humour of mauruccio's dotage discoursed how in the winter of his age he is become a lover thou wouldst swear a morris dance were but a tragedy compared to that well we will see the youth
− what council hold you now sirs
we my lord were talking of the horsemanship in france which as your friend reports he thinks exceeds all other nations
why have not we as gallant riders here
none that i know
pish your affection leads you i dare wage a thousand ducats not a man in france outrides roseilli
aside i shall quit this wrong
i said as much my lord
i have not seen his practice since my coming back
how is't we see him not
i hear he was commanded from the court
aside o confusion on this villainous occasion
true but we meant a day or two at most should be his furthest term
you know our mind how comes it thus to pass we miss roseilli
my lord in a sudden discontent i hear he departed towards benevento determining as i am given to understand to pass to seville minding to visit his cousin don pedro de toledo in the spanish court
now by the blessèd bones of good saint francis let there posts be sent to call him back or i will post thy head beneath my foot − ha you
you know my mind look that you get him back the spanish court
and without our commission
aside here's fine juggling
good sir be not so moved
fie fie bianca tis such a gross indignity i'd rather have lost seven years' revenue − the spanish court
− how now what ails our sister
on the sudden i fall a bleeding 'tis an ominous sign pray heaven it turn to good
− your highness' leave
− come fernando − come bianca − let's strive to overpass this choleric heat
− to d'avolos sirrah see that you trifle not
− how we who sway the manage by authority may be abused by smooth officious agents
− but look well to our sister
exeunt all but petruchio and fernando
nephew please you to see your friend to night
thus bodies walk unsouled
mine eyes but follows my heart entombed in yonder goodly shrine life without her is but death's subtle snares and i am but a coffin to my cares
a room in mauruccio's house
mauruccio looking in a glass trimming his beard giacopo brushing him
beard be confined to neatness that no hair may stover up to prick my mistress' lip more rude than bristles of a porcupine
am i all sweet behind
i have no poulterer's nose but your apparel sits about you most debonairly
but giacopo with what grace do my words proceed out of my mouth
have i a moving countenance
is there harmony in my voice
canst thou perceive as it were a handsomeness of shape in my very breath as it is formed into syllables giacopo
enter above duke bianca fiormonda fernando courtiers and attendants
yes indeed sir i do feel a savour as pleasant as − aside a glister pipe − calamus or civet
observe him and be silent
hold thou the glass giacopo and mark me with what exceeding comeliness i could court the lady marquess if it come to the push
sister you are his aim
a subject fit to be the stale of laughter
thus i reverse my pace and thus stalkingly in courtly gait i advance one two and three
i kiss my hand make my congee settle my countenance and thus begin
− hold up the glass higher giacopo
'tis well now mark me most excellent marquéss most fair la dý let not old age or hairs that are sil vér disparage my desire for it may be i am than other green youth nimble ér
since i am your gra−cé’s servánt so true great lady then love me for my vir túe
o giacopo petrarch was a dunce dante a jig maker sanazzar a goose and ariosto a puck fist to me
i tell thee giacopo i am rapt with fury and have been for these six nights together drunk with the pure liquor of helicon
i think no less sir for you look as wild and talk as idly as if you had not slept these nine years
what think you of this language sister
sir i think in princes' courts no age nor greatness but must admit the fool in me 'twere folly to scorn what greater states than i have been
o but you are too general − fiorm
i thank your highness many a woman's wit have thought themselves much better was much worse
you still mistake me
god a mercy brains
− giacopo i have it
a conceit giacopo and a fine one − down on thy knees giacopo and worship my wit
give me both thy ears
thus it is i will have my picture drawn most composituously in a square table of some two foot long from the crown of the head to the waist downward no further
then you'll look like a dwarf sir being cut off by the middle
speak not thou but wonder at the conceit that follows in my bosom on my left side i will have a leaf of blood red crimson velvet − as it were part of my doublet − open which being opened giacopo − now mark
− i will have a clear and most transparent crystal in the form of a heart
– when i have framed this i will as some rare outlandish piece of workmanship bestow it on the most fair and illustrious lady fiormonda
but now sir for the conceit
simplicity and ignorance prate no more
blockhead dost not understand yet
why this being to her instead of a looking glass she shall no oftener powder her hair surfle her cheeks cleanse her teeth or conform the hairs of her eyebrows but having occasion to use this glass − which for the rareness and richness of it she will hourly do − but she shall as often gaze on my picture remember me and behold the excellence of her excellency's beauty in the prospective and mirror as it were in my heart
ay marry sir this is something
all above except fiorm
my sister's gone in anger
search with thine eyes giacopo
o my lord my lord you have gotten an everlasting fame
the duke's grace and the duchess' grace and my lord fernando's grace with all the rabble of courtiers have heard every word look where they stand
now you shall be made a count for your wit and i lord for my counsel
pity − o my wisdom
i must speak to them
− o duke most great and most renowèd duchess
excuse my apprehensiön which not much is 'tis love my lord that's all the hurt you see angelica herself shall plead for me
we pardon you most wise and learnèd lord and that we may all glorify your wit entreat your wisdom's company to day to grace our talk with your grave discourse what says your mighty eloquence
giacopo help me his grace has put me out of my own bias and i know not what to answer in form
ud's me tell him you'll come
yes i will come my lord the duke i will
we take your word and wish your honour health
come bianca we have found a salve for melancholy − mirth and ease
exit the duke followed by all but bianca and fernando
i'll see the jolly lover and his glass take leave of one another
o my lord i do now smell news
the duke has a smackering towards you and you shall clap up with his sister the widow suddenly
she is mine giacopo she is mine
advance the glass giacopo that i may practise as i pass to walk a portly grace like a marquesse to which degree i am now a climbing
thus do we march to honour's haven of bliss to ride in triumph through persepolis
exit giacopo going backward with the glass followed by mauruccio complimenting
now as i live here's laughter worthy our presence
i will not lose him so
to me my lord
please but to hear the story of a castaway in love and o let not the passage of a jest make slight a sadder subject who hath placed all happiness in your diviner eyes
my lord the time − ferna
" yet hear me speak for i must speak or burst i have a soul so anchored down with cares in seas of woe that passion and the vows i owe to you have changed me to a lean anatomy sweet princess of my life − bian
forbear or i shall − ferna
yet as you honour virtue do not freeze my hopes to more discomfort than as yet my fears suggest no beauty so adorns the composition of a well built mind as pity hear me out
i spare to tell you what you are and must confess do almost hate my judgment that it once thought goodness dwelt in you
remember now it is the third time since your treacherous tongue hath pleaded treason to my ear and fame yet for the friendship 'twixt my lord and you i have not voiced your follies if you dare to speak a fourth time you shall rue your lust 'tis all no better − learn and love yourself
how am i undone
no no in her chaste breast virtue and resolution have discharged all female weakness i have sued and sued kneeled wept and begged but tears and vows and words move her no more than summer winds a rock
i must resolve to check this rage of blood and will she is all icy to my fires yet even that ice inflames in me desires
a room in petruchio's house
enter petruchio and roseilli
is't possible the duke should be so moved
'tis true you have no enemy at court but her for whom you pine so much in love then master your affections i am sorry you hug your ruin so
− what say you to the project i proposed
i entertain it with a greater joy than shame can check
you are come as i could wish my cousin is resolved
without delay prepare yourself and meet at court anon some half hour hence and cupid bless your joy
if ever man was bounden to a friend − ferna
exeunt petruchio and roseilli
love's rage is yet unknown in his − ay me
− too well i feel my own
− so now i am alone now let me think she is the duchess say she be a creature sewed up in painted cloth might so be styled that's but a name she's married too she is and therefore better might distinguish love she's young and fair − why madam that's the bait invites me more to hope she's the duke's wife who knows not this
− she's bosomed to my friend there there i am quite lost will not be won still worse and worse abhors to hear me speak eternal mischief
i must urge no more for were i not be lepered in my soul here were enough to quench the flames of hell
if i must not speak i'll write
− come then sad secretary to my plaints plead thou my faith for words are turned to sighs
what says this paper
takes out a letter and reads
enter d’avolos behind with two pictures
aside now is the time
what in the name of policy should this mean
by all the hopes of my life plain passion
now i perceive it
if this be not a fit of some violent affection i am an ass in understanding why 'tis plain − plainer and plainer love in the extremest
oh for the party
the greatness of his spirits is too high cherished to be caught with some ordinary stuff and if it be my lady fiormonda i am strangely mistook
well that i have fit occasion soon to understand
i have here two pictures newly drawn to be sent for a present to the abbot of monaco the duchess' uncle her own and my lady's i'll observe which of these may perhaps bewray him − 'a turns about
− my noble lord
y'are welcome sir i thank you
for what my lord
i cry you mercy d'avolos i took you for another pray excuse me
what is't you bear there
no secret my lord but may be imparted to you a couple of pictures my good lord − please you see them
i care not much for pictures but whose are they
the one is for my lord's sister the other is the duchess
− aside sure the word startled him observe that
you told me master secretary once you owed me love
service my honoured lord howsoever you please to term it
'twere rudeness to be suitor for a sight yet trust me sir i'll be all secret
i beseech your lordship − they are as i am constant to your pleasure
this my lord is the widow marquess's as it now newly came from the picture drawer's the oil yet green a sweet picture and in my judgment art hath not been a niggard in striving to equal the life
michael angelo himself needed not blush to own the workmanship
a very pretty picture but kind signior to whose use is it
for the duke's my lord who determines to send it with all speed as a present to paul baglione uncle to the duchess that he may see the riches of two such lustres as shine in the court of pavy
pray sir the other
this my lord is for the duchess bianca a wondrous sweet picture if you well observe with what singularity the artsman hath strove to set forth each limb in exquisitest proportion not missing a hair
she cannot more formally or − if it may be lawful to use the word more really − behold her own symmetry in her glass than in taking a sensible view of this counterfeit
when i first saw it i verily almost was of a mind that this was her very lip
aside how constantly he dwells upon this portraiture
− nay i'll assure your lordship there is no defect of cunning − aside his eye is fixed as if it were incorporated there
− were not the party herself alive to witness that there is a creature composed of flesh and blood as naturally enriched with such harmony of admiral beauty as is here artificially counterfeited a very curious eye might repute it as an imaginary rapture of some transported conceit to aim at an impossibility whose very first gaze is of force almost to persuade a substantial love in a settled heart
my honoured lord − ferna
aside i am confirmed
− what ails your lordship
you need not praise it sir itself is praise
− aside how near had i forgot myself
− i thank you
'tis such a picture as might well become the shrine of some faned venus i am dazzled with looking on't − pray sir convey it hence
i am all your servant
− aside blessed blessed discovery
− please you to command me
− aside i'm lost beyond my senses
− d'ee hear sir
good where dwells the picture maker
by the castle's farther drawbridge near galiazzo's statue his name is alphonso trinultio

you must needs play well you are so studious
you study past patience − what d'ee dream on
here's demurring would weary out a statue
− good now play
kneeling forgive me let my knees forever stick nailed to the ground as earthy as my fears ere i arise to part away so cursed in my unbounded anguish as the rage of flames beyond all utterance of words devour me lightened by your sacred eyes
what means the man
to lay before your feet in lowest vassalage the bleeding heart that sighs the tender of a suit disdained
great lady pity me my youth my wounds and do not think that i have culled this time from motion's swiftest measure to unclasp the book of lust if purity of love have residence in virtue's quest lo here bent lower in my heart than on my knee i beg compassion to a love as chaste as softness of desire can intimate
re enter d’avolos behind
aside at it already
am i again betrayed
keep in bright angel that severer breath to cool that heat of cruëlty which sways the temple of your too stony breast you cannot urge one reason to rebuke my trembling plea which i have not with many nights' expense examined but o madam still i find no physic strong to cure a tortured mind but freedom from the torture it sustains

know most unworthy man so much we hate the baseness of thy lust as were none living of thy sex but thee we had much rather prostitute our blood to some envenomed serpent than admit thy bestial dalliance
couldst thou dare to speak again when we forbad

forever lady now good night
rest in your goodness
− enter attendants with lights
exeunt bianca and fernando sundry ways with attendants
− to be cuckold − mercy and providence − is as natural to a married man as to eat sleep or wear a nightcap
− i will rather trust mine arm in the throat of a lion my purse with a courtesan my neck with the chance on a die or my religion in a synagogue of jews than my wife with a friend
wherein do princes exceed the poorest peasant that ever was yoked to a sixpenny strumpet but that the horns of the one are mounted some two inches higher by a choppine than the other
the goodliest headed beast of the forest amongst wild cattle is a stag and the goodliest beast among tame fools in a corporation is a cuckold
speak d'avolos how thrives intelligence
above the prevention of fate madam
i saw him kneel make pitiful faces kiss hands and forefingers rise − and by this time he is up up madam
doubtless the youth aims to be duke for he is gotten into the duke's seat an hour ago
siege was laid parley admitted composition offered and the fort entered there's no interruption
the duke will be at home to morrow gentle animal

enter bianca her hair about her ears in her night mantle
she draws a curtain and fernando is discovered in bed sleeping she sets down the candle before the bed and goes to the bedside
resolve and do 'tis done
are those eyes which lately were so overdrowned in tears so easy to take rest
how sweetly sleep hath sealed up sorrows here
but i will call him
− what my lord my lord my lord fernando
my lord sleeping or waking
'tis i have you forgot my voice
or is your ear but useful to your eye
she 'tis she sit up sit up and wonder whiles my sorrows swell the nights are short and i have much to say
is't possible 'tis you
'tis possible why do you think i come
to crown joys and make me master of my best desires
'tis true you guess aright sit up and listen
with shame and passion now i must confess since first mine eyes beheld you in my heart you have been only king if there can be a violence in love then i have felt that tyranny be record to my soul the justice which i for this folly fear
fernando in short words howe'er my tongue did often chide thy love each word thou spak'st was music to my ear was never poor poor wretched woman lived that loved like me so truly so unfeignèdly
to witness that i speak is truth look here
thus singly i adventure to thy bed and do confess my weakness if thou tempt'st my bosom to thy pleasures i will yield
now hear me out
when first caraffa pavy's duke my lord saw me he loved me and without respect of dower took me to his bed and bosom advanced me to the titles i possess not moved by counsel or removed by greatness which to requite betwixt my soul and heaven i vowed a vow to live a constant wife i have done so nor was there in the world a man created could have broke that truth for all the glories of the earth but thou − but thou fernando
do i love thee now
true i do beyond imagination if no pledge of love can instance what i speak is true but loss of my best joys here here fernando be satisfied and ruin me
to give my body up to thy embraces a pleasure that i never wished to thrive in before this fatal minute
mark me now if thou dost spoil me of this robe of shame by my best comforts here i vow again to thee to heaven to the world to time ere yet the morning shall new christen day i'll kill myself
i will do what thou wilt 'tis in thy choice what say ye
do you come to try me
tell me first will you but grant a kiss
yes take it that or what thy heart can wish i am all thine
− come come how many women pray were ever heard or read of granted love and did as you protest you will
fernando jest not at my calamity
by these dishevelled hairs these wretched tears by all that's good if what i speak my heart vows not eternally then think my lord was never man sued to me i denied − think me a common and most cunning whore and let my sins be written on my grave my name rest in reproof
do as you list
i must believe ye − yet i hope anon when you are parted from me you will say i was a good cold easy spirited man nay laugh at my simplicity say will ye
no by the faith i owe my bridal vows
but ever hold thee much much dearer far than all my joys on earth by this chaste kiss
you have prevailed and heaven forbid that i should by a wanton appetite profane this sacred temple
'tis enough for me you'll please to call me servant
nay be thine command my power my bosom and i'll write this love within the tables of my heart
enough i'll master passion and triumph in being conquered adding to it this in you my love as it begun shall end
the latter i new vow
but day comes on what now we leave unfinished of content each hour shall pérfect up sweet let us part
this kiss − best life good rest
all mine to thee
remember this and think i speak thy words "when i am dead rip up my heart and read with constant eyes what now my tongue defines fernando's name carved out in bloody lines
" once more good rest sweet
your most faithful servant

pray sir vouchsafe me hearing
shame to my grave
o whore wretched beyond utterance or reformation what wouldst say
sir by the honour of my mother's hearse he has protested marriage pledged his faith if vows have any force i am his wife
why thou fool thou wickedly credulous fool canst thou imagine luxury is observant of religion
no no it is with a frequent lecher as usual to forswear as to swear their piety is in making idolatry a worship their hearts and their tongues are as different as thou thou whore
you are too violent his truth will prove his constancy and so excuse my fault
this belief will damn thee
how will thy lady marquess justly reprove me for preferring to her service a monster of so lewd and impudent a life
look to't if thy smooth devil leave thee to thy infamy i will never pity thy mortal pangs never lodge thee under my roof never own thee for my child mercy be my witness
enter petruchio leading colona
hide not thy folly by unwise excuse thou art undone colona no entreaties no warning no persuasion could put off the habit of thy dotage on that man of much deceit ferentes
would thine eyes had seen me in my grave ere i had known the stain of this thine honour
good my lord reclaim your incredulity my fault proceeds from lawful compositiön of wedlock he hath sealed his oath to mine to be my husband
nay then we have partners in affliction if my jolly gallant's long clapper have struck on both sides all is well
− petruchio thou art not wise enough to be a paritor come hither man come hither speak softly is thy daughter with child
do not trick me off i overheard your gabbling
hark in thine ear so is mine too
alas my lord by whom
what an idle question is that

methinks thou art wondrous patient why i am mad stark mad
how like you this colona
'tis too true did not this man protest to be your husband
to me he did
what else what else petruchio
− and madam my quondam daughter i hope h'ave passed some huge words of matrimony to you too
to me he did
and how many more the great incubus of hell knows best
− petruchio give me your hand mine own daughter in this arm − and yours colona in this − there there sit ye down together
julia and colona sit down
never rise as you hope to inherit our blessings till you have plotted some brave revenge think upon it to purpose and you shall want no seconds to further it be secret one to another
− come petruchio let 'em alone the wenches will demur on't and for the process we'll give 'em courage
you counsel wisely i approve your plot
– think on your shames and who it was that wrought 'em
ay ay ay leave them alone
− to work wenches to work
exeunt nibrassa and petruchio
we are quite ruined
true colona betrayed to infamy deceived and mocked by an unconstant villain what shall's do
i am with child
and so am i but what shall's do now
this with cunning words first prove his love he knows i am with child
and so he knows i am i told him on't last meeting in the lobby and in troth the false deceiver laughed
now by the stars he did the like to me and said 'twas well i was so haply sped
those very words he used to me it fretted me to th' heart i'll be revenged
here's a noise methinks
let's rise we'll take a time to talk of this
they rise and walk aside
enter ferentes and morona an old lady
death of my delights have ye lost all sense of shame
y'are best roar about the court that i have been your woman's barber and trimmed ye kind morona
defiance to thy kindness
th'ast robbed me of my good name didst promise to love none but me me only me swor'st like an unconscionable villain to marry me the twelfth day of the month two months since didst make my bed thine own mine house thine own mine all and everything thine own
i will exclaim to the world on thee and beg justice of the duke himself villain
nay and if you be in that mood shut up your fore shop i'll be your journeyman no longer
why wise madam dryfist could your mouldy brain be so addle to imagine i would marry a stale widow at six and forty
are there not varieties enough of thirteen
come stop your clap dish or i'll purchase a carting for you
− by this light i have toiled more with this tough carrion hen than with ten quails scarce grown into their first feathers
o treason to all honesty or religion
− speak thou perjured damnable ungracious defiler of women who shall father my child which thou hast begotten
why thee countrywoman th'ast a larger purse to pay for the nursing
nay if you'll needs have the world know how you reputed a grave matron like motherly madam kicked up your heels like a jennet whose mark is new come into her mouth e'en do do
the worst can be said of me is that i was ill advised to dig for gold in a coal pit
let's fall amongst 'em
julia comes forward with colona to ferentes − love how is't chick
my dear ferentes my betrothèd lord
o for three barbary stone horses to top three flanders mares
− why how now wenches

to ferentes love you must go with me
to ferentes good love let's walk
aside i must rid my hands of 'em or they'll ride on my shoulders
− by your leave ladies here's none but is of common counsel one with another in short there are three of ye with child you tell me by me
all of you i cannot satisfy nor indeed handsomely any of ye
you all hope i should marry you which for that it is impossible to be done i am content to have neither of ye for your looking big on the matter keep your own counsels i'll not bewray ye
but for marriage − heaven bless ye and me from ye
this is my resolution
nor you nor you nor you and to give you some satisfaction i'll yield you reasons
− you colona had a pretty art in your dalliance but your fault was you were too suddenly won
− you madam morona could have pleased well enough some three or four and thirty years ago but you are too old
− you julia were young enough but your fault is you have a scurvy face
− now everyone knowing her proper defect thank me that i ever vouchsafed you the honour of my bed once in your lives
if you want clouts all i'll promise is to rip up an old shirt or two
so wishing a speedy deliverance to all your burdens i commend you to your patience

enter the duke bianca supported by fernando fiormonda petruchio nibrassa ferentes and d'avolos
roseilli will not come then
well his pride shall ruin him
− our letters speak the duchess' uncle will be here to morrow − to morrow d'avolos
to morrow night my lord but not to make more than one day's abode here for his holiness has commanded him to be at rome the tenth of this month the conclave of cardinals not being resolved to sit till his coming
your uncle sweetheart at his next return must be saluted "cardinal"
− ferentes be it your charge to think on some device to entertain the present with delight
my lord in honour to the court of pavy i'll join with you
− ferentes not long since i saw in bruxils at my being there the duke of brabant welcome the archbishop of mentz with rare conceit even on a sudden performed by knights and ladies of his court in nature of an antic which methought − for that i ne'er before saw women antics − was for the newness strange and much commended
now good my lord fernando further this in any wise it cannot but content
aside if she entreat 'tis ten to one the man is won beforehand
friend thou honour'st me but can it be so speedily performed
i'll undertake it if the ladies please to exercise in person only that and we must have a fool or such an one as can with art well act him

perhaps your teeth have bled wipe't with my handkercher give me i'll do't myself
− aside to fernando speak shall i steal a kiss
believe me my lord i long
not for the world
beshrew my heart but that's not so good
ha what's that thou mislikest d'avolos
nothing my lord − but i was hammering a conceit of my own which cannot i find in so short a time thrive as a day's practice
aside well put off secretary
we are too sad methinks the life of mirth should still be fed where we are where's mauruccio
and't please your highness he's of late grown so affectionately inward with my lady marquess's fool that i presume he is confident there are few wise men worthy of his society who are not as innocently harmless as that creature
it is almost impossible to separate them and 'tis a question which of the two is the wiser man
would 'a were here
i have a kind of dulness hangs on me since my hunting that i feel as 'twere a disposition to be sick my head is ever aching
a shrewd ominous token i like not that neither
what is't you like not
i beseech your highness excuse me i am so busy with this frivolous project and can bring it to no shape that it almost confounds my capacity
my lord you were best to try a set at maw
i and your friend to pass away the time will undertake your highness and your sister
the game's too tedious
'tis a peevish play your knave will heave the queen out or your king besides 'tis all on fortune
enter mauruccio with roseilli disguised as before and giacopo
bless thee most excellent duke
i here present thee as worthy and learned a gentleman as ever i − and yet i have lived threescore years − conversed with
take it from me i have tried him and he is worthy to be privy counsellor to the greatest turk in christendom of a most apparent and deep understanding slow of speech but speaks to the purpose
− come forward sir and appear before his highness in your own proper elements
will − tye − to da new toate sure la now
a very senseless gentleman and please your highness one that has a great deal of little wit as they say
o sir had you heard him as i did deliver whole histories in the tangay tongue you would swear there were not such a linguist breathed again and did i but perfectly understand his language i would be confident in less than two hours to distinguish the meaning of bird beast or fish naturally as i myself speak italian my lord
well he has rare qualities
now prithee question him mauruccio
i will my lord
– tell me rare scholar which in thy opinion doth cause the strongest breath garlíc or onion
answer him brother fool do do speak thy mind chuck do
have bid seen all da fine knack and d'ee naghtye tat tle of da kna ve dad la have so
we understand him not
admirable i protest duke mark o duke mark
− what did i ask him giacopo
what caused the strongest breath garlic or onions i take it sir
right right by helicon
and his answer is that a knave has a stronger breath than any of 'em wisdom − or i am an ass − in the highest a direct figure put it down giacopo
how happy is that idiot whose ambition is but to eat and sleep and shun the rod
men that have more of wit and use it ill are fools in proof
true my lord there's many who think themselves most wise that are most fools
bitter girds if all were known − but − duke
speak out plague on your muttering grumbling
i hear you sir what is't
nothing i protest to your highness pertinent to any moment
− to fernando friend you promised study
− i am not well in temper
− attend our friend ferentes
exeunt all but fernando roseilli ferentes and mauruccio
ferentes take mauruccio in with you he must be one in action
come my lord i shall entreat your help
i'll stay the fool and follow instantly
yes pray my lord
exeunt ferentes and mauruccio
how thrive your hopes now cousin
then let me cast myself beneath thy foot true virtuous lord
know then sir her proud heart is only fixed on you in such extremes of violence and passion that i fear or she'll enjoy you or she'll ruin you
by all the joys i wish to taste she is as far beneath my thought as i in soul above her malice
i observed even now a kind of dangerous pretence in an unjointed phrase from d'avolos
i know not his intent but this i know he has a working brain is minister to all my lady's counsels and my lord pray heaven there have not anything befall'n within the knowledge of his subtle art to do you mischief
should he or hell affront me in the passage of my fate i'd crush them into atomies
i do admit you could meantime my lord be nearest to yourself what i can learn you shall be soon informed of here is all we fools can catch the wise in − to unknot by privilege of coxcombs what they plot
another room in the palace
enter duke and d’avolos
thou art a traitor do not think the gloss of smooth evasion by your cunning jests and coinage of your politician's brain shall jig me off i'll know't i vow i will
did not i note your dark abrupted ends of words half spoke
your "wells if all were known"
your short like not that"
your girds and "buts"
yes sir i did such broken language argues more matter than your subtlety shall hide tell me what is't
by honour's self i'll know
what would you know my lord
i confess i owe my life and service to you as to my prince the one you have the other you may take from me at your pleasure
should i devise matter to feed your distrust or suggest likelihoods without appearance
what would you have me say
on thy brow i read distracted horrors figured in thy looks
on thy allegiance d'avolos as e'er thou hop'st to live in grace with us unfold what by the parti halting of thy speech thy knowledge can discover
by the faith we bear to sacred justice we protest be it or good or evil thy reward shall be our special thanks and love untermed speak on thy duty we thy prince command
my lord i am so charmed by those powerful repetitions of love and duty that i cannot conceal what i know of your dishonour
then my soul is cleft with fear i half presage my misery say on speak it at once for i am great with grief
i trust your highness will pardon me yet i will not deliver a syllable which shall be less innocent than truth itself
by all our wish of joys we pardon thee
get from me cowardly servility
− my service is noble and my loyalty an armour of brass in short my lord and plain discovery you are a cuckold
keep in the word − a cuckold
fernando is your rival has stolen your duchess' heart murthered friendship horns your head and laughs at your horns
my heart is split
take courage be a prince in resolution i knew it would nettle you in the fire of your composition and was loth to have given the first report of this more than ridiculous blemish to all patience or moderation but oh my lord what would not a subject do to approve his loyalty to his sovereign
yet good sir take it as quietly as you can i must needs say 'tis a foul fault but what man is he under the sun that is free from the career of his destiny
maybe she will in time reclaim the errors of her youth or 'twere a great happiness in you if you could not believe it that's the surest way my lord in my poor counsel
the icy current of my frozen blood is kindled up in agonies as hot as flames of burning sulphur
had my dukedom's whole inheritance been rent mine honours levelled in the dust so she that wicked woman might have slept chaste in my bosom 't had been all a sport
and he that villain viper to my heart that he should be the man
that he should be the man death above utterance
take heed you prove this true
my lord − duke
if not i'll tear thee joint by joint
methinks it should not be − bianca
why i took her from lower than a bondage − hell of hells
− see that you make it good
as for that would it were as good as i would make it
i can if you will temper your distractions but bring you where you shall see it no more
ay see it if that be proof sufficient
i for my part will slack no service that may testify my simplicity
sir the abbot is now upon arrival all your servants attend your presence
we will give him welcome as shall befit our love and his respect
come mine own best fernando my dear friend
the duke exits with fernando
now for a horned moon
sound of music within
but i hear the preparation for the entertainment of this great abbot
let him come and go that matters nothing to this whiles he rides abroad in hope to purchase a purple hat our duke shall as earnestly heat the pericranion of his noddle with a yellow hood at home
i hear 'em coming
enter servants with torches after the duke followed by fernando bianca fiormonda petruchio and nibrassa at one door enter at another door two friars the abbot and attendants at the other
the duke and abbot meet and salute bianca and the rest salute and are saluted they rank themselves and pass over the stage and go out
on to your vitailles some of ye i know feed upon wormwood
another apartment in the palace
enter petruchio and nibrassa with napkins as from supper
the duke's on rising − are you ready
then petruchio arm thyself with courage and resolution and do not shrink from being stayed on thy own virtue
− i hear 'em coming
enter attendants with lights after the duke abbot bianca flormonda fernando and d’avolos
right reverend uncle though our minds be scanted in giving welcome as our hearts would wish yet we will strive to shew how much we joy your presence with a courtly shew of mirth
please you to sit
great duke your worthy honours to me shall still have place in my best thanks since you in me so much respect the church thus much i'll promise − at my next return his holiness shall grant you an indulgence both large and general
− seat you my lords
− now let the masquers enter
enter in an antic fashion ferentes roseilli and mauruccio at several doors they dance a little
suddenly enter to them colona julia and morona in odd shapes and dance the men gaze at them and are at a stand
the men are invited by the women to dance
they dance together sundry changes at last ferentes is closed in − mauruccio and roseilli being shook off stand at different ends of the stage gazing
the women join hands and dance about ferentes with divers complimental offers of courtship at length they suddenly fall upon him and stab him he falls down and they run out at several doors
uncase me i am slain in jest
a pox upon your outlandish feminine antics
pull off my visor i shall bleed to death ere i have time to feel where i am hurt
− duke i am slain off with my visor for heaven's sake off with my visor
− take his visor off − they unmask ferentes we are betrayed seize on them
two are yonder − hold ferentes
− follow the rest apparent treachery
holy saint bennet what a sight is this
re enter julia colona and morona unmasked every one with a child in her arms
be not amazed great princes but vouchsafe your audience we are they have done this deed
look here the pledges of this false man's lust betrayed in our simplicities he swore and pawned his truth to marry each of us abused us all unable to revenge our public shames but by his public fall which thus we have contrived nor do we blush to call the glory of this murther ours we did it and we'll justify the deed for when in sad complaints we claimed his vows his answer was reproach − villain is't true
i was "too quickly won" you slave
i was "too old" you dog
i − and i never shall forget the wrong − i was "not fair enough" not fair enough for thee thou monster
− let me cut his gall − "not fair enough"
forbear you monstrous women
do not add murther to lust your lives shall pay this forfeit
pox upon all cod piece extravagancy
i am peppered − oh oh oh
− duke forgive me
− had i rid any tame beasts but barbary wild colts i had not been thus jerked out of the saddle
my forfeit was in my blood and my life hath answered it
vengeance on all wild whores i say
− oh 'tis true − farewell generation of hackneys
to prison with those monstrous strumpets
stay i'll answer for my daughter
and i for mine
− o well done girls
i for yon gentlewoman sir
good my lord i am an innocent in the business
to prison with him
bear the body hence
here's fatal sad presages but 'tis just he dies by murther that hath lived in lust
an apartment in the palace
enter duke fiormonda and d’avolos
is there in thy veins one drop of blood that issued from the loins of pavy's ancient dukes
or dost thou sit on great lorenzo's seat our glorious father and canst not blush to be so far beneath the spirit of heroic ancestors
canst thou engross a slavish shame which men far far below the region of thy state not more abhor than study to revenge
i could burst with rage to think i have a brother so befooled in giving patience to a harlot's lust
one my lord that doth so palpably so apparently make her adulteries a trophy whiles the poting stick to her unsatiate and more than goatish abomination jeers at and flouts your sleepish and more than sleepish security
what is she but the sallow coloured brat of some unlanded bankrupt taught to catch the easy fancies of young prodigal bloods in springes of her stew instructed art
here's your most virtuous duchess
more base in the infiniteness of her sensuality than corruption can infect − to clip and inveigle your friend too
how of all men are you most unfortunate
− to pour out your soul into the bosom of such a creature as holds it religion to make your own trust a key to open the passage to your own wife's womb to be drunk in the privacies of your bed
− think upon that sir
be gentle in your tortures e'en for pity for pity's cause i beg it
th'adst better duke thou hadst been born a peasant
now boys will sing thy scandal in the streets tune ballads to thy infamy get money by making pageants of thee and invent some strangely shaped man beast that may for horns resemble thee and call it "pavy's duke"
there's the mischief sir in the meantime you shall be sure to have a bastard − of whom you did not so much as beget a little toe a left ear or half the further side of an upper lip − inherit both your throne and name this would kill the soul of very patience itself
forbear the ashy paleness of my cheek is scarleted in ruddy flakes of wrath and like some bearded meteor shall suck up with swiftest terror all those dusky mists that overcloud compassion in our breast
you have roused a sleeping lion whom no art no fawning smoothness shall reclaim but blood
− and sister thou − thou roderico thou − from whom i take the surfeit of my bane henceforth no more so eagerly pursue to whet my dulness you shall see caraffa equal his birth and matchless in revenge
why now i hear you speak in majesty
and it becomes my lord most princely
− come hither sister
thou art near in nature and as near to me in love i love thee yes by yon bright firmament i love thee dearly
but observe me well if any private grudge or female spleen malice or envy or such woman's frailty have spurred thee on to set my soul on fire without apparent certainty − i vow and vow again by all our princely blood hadst thou a double soul or were the lives of fathers mothers children or the hearts of all our tribe in thine i would unrip that womb of bloody mischief with these nails where such a cursèd plot as this was hatched
− but d'avolos for thee − no more to work a yet more strong impression in my brain you must produce an instance to mine eye both present and apparent − nay you shall − or − fiorm
you will be mad
be rather wise think on ferentes first and think by whom the harmless youth was slaughtered had he lived he would have told you tales fernando feared it and to prevent him − under shew forsooth of rare device − most trimly cut him off
have you yet eyes duke
shrewdly urged − 'tis piercing
for looking on a sight shall split your soul you shall not care i'll undertake myself to do't some two days hence for need to night but that you are in court
would you desire my lord to see them exchange kisses sucking one another's lips nay begetting an heir to the dukedom or practising more than the very act of adultery itself
give but a little way by a feigned absence and you shall find 'em − i blush to speak doing what i am mad to think on't you are most shamefully most sinfully most scornfully cornuted
d'ee play upon me
as i am your prince there's some shall roar for this
why what was i both to be thought or made so vild a thing
− stay madam marquess − ho roderico you sir − bear witness that if ever i neglect one day one hour one minute to wear out with toil of plot or practice of conceit my busy skull till i have found a death more horrid than the bull of phalaris or all the fabling poets dreaming whips if ever i take rest or force a smile which is not borrowed from a royal vengeance before i know which way to satisfy fury and wrong − nay kneel down − they kneel
let me die more wretched than despair reproach contempt laughter and poverty itself can make me
let's rise on all sides friends − they rise
now all's agreed if the moon serve some that are safe shall bleed
enter bianca fernando and morona
my lord the duke − duke
− come shall's shake hands sirs
− 'faith this is kindly done
here's three as one welcome dear wife sweet friend
aside to fiormonda i do not like this now it shows scurvily to me
my lord we have a suit your friend and i − duke
aside she puts my "friend" before most kindly still
must join − duke
"must join" you say − bian
that you will please to set mauruccio at liberty this gentlewoman here hath by agreement made betwixt them two obtained him for her husband good my lord let me entreat i dare engage mine honour he's innocent in any wilful fault
now beshrew you for't engage your honour on so slight a ground honour's a precious jewël i can tell you nay 'tis bianca − go to d'avolos bring us mauruccio hither
i shall my lord
i humbly thank your grace ferna
and royal sir since julia and colona chief actors in ferentes' tragic end were through their ladies' mediatiön freed by your gracious pardon i in pity tendered this widow's friendless misery for whose reprieve i shall in humblest duty be ever thankful
re enter d’avolos with mauruccio in poor rags and giacopo weeping
come you my learnèd counsel do not roar if i must hang why then lament therefore you may rejoice and both no doubt be great to serve your prince when i am turnèd worms' meat
i fear my lands and all i have is beggèd else woe is me why should i be so ragged
come on sir the duke stays for you
o how my stomach doth begin to puke when i do hear that only word the duke
you sir look on that woman are you pleased if we remit your body from the jail to take her for your wife
on that condition prince with all my heart
yes i warrant your grace he is content
why foolish man hast thou so soon forgot the public shame of her abusèd womb her being mother to a bastard's birth
or canst thou but imagine she will be true to thy bed who to herself was false
to mauruccio phew sir do not stand upon that that's a matter of nothing you know
nay and shall please your good grace and it come to that i care not as good men as i have lain in foul sheets i am sure the linen has not been much the worse for the wearing a little i will have her with all my heart
− fernando thou shalt have the grace to join their hands put 'em together friend
yes do my lord bring you the bridegroom hither i'll give the bride myself
aside here's argument to jealousy as good as drink to the dropsy she will share any disgrace with him i could not wish it better
even so well do it
here mauruccio long live a happy couple
fernando and bianca join their hands
'tis enough − now know our pleasure henceforth
'tis our will if ever thou mauruccio or thy wife be seen within a dozen miles at court we will recall our mercy no entreat shall warrant thee a minute of thy life we'll have no servile slavery of lust shall breathe near us dispatch and get ye hence
− bianca come with me
− aside o my cleft soul
exeunt duke and bianca
must i come no more near the court
not near the court sir
not by a dozen miles indeed sir
your only course i can advise you is to pass to naples and set up a house of carnality there are very fair and frequent suburbs and you need not fear the contagion of any pestilent disease for the worst is very proper to the place
'tis a strange sentence
'tis and sudden too and not without some mystery
will you go sir
not near the court
what matter is it sweetheart
fear nothing love you shall have new change of apparel good diet wholesome attendance − and we will live like pigeons my lord
wilt thou forsake me giacopo
no not as long as i have a whole ear on my head come what will come
mauruccio you did once proffer true love to me but since you are more thriftier sped for old affection's sake here take this gold spend it for my sake
madam you do nobly − and that's for me mauruccio
they give him money
will ye go sir
yes i will go − and i humbly thank your lordship and ladyship
− pavy sweet pavy farewell
− come wife − come giacopo − now is the time that we away must lag and march in pomp with baggage and with bag
what hast thou misdone to end thy life when life was new begun
− adieu to all for lords and ladies see my woeful plight and squires of low degree
exeunt all but fiormonda and fernando
my lord fernando − ferna
do you note my brother's odd distractions
− you were wont to bosom in his counsels i am sure you know the ground on it
not i in troth
what would you say my lord if he out of some melancholy spleen edged on by some thank picking parasite should now prove jealous
i mistrust it shrewdly
yes for but observe a prince whose eye is chooser to his heart is seldom steady in the lists of love unless the party he affects do match his rank in equal portion or in friends i never yet out of report or else by warranted description have observed the nature of fantastic jealousy if not in him yet on my conscience now he has no cause
by this light i'll pledge my soul against a useless rush
i never thought her less yet trust me sir no merit can be greater than your praise whereat i strangely wonder how a man vowed as you told me to a single life should so much deify the saints from whom you have disclaimed devotion
madam 'tis true from them i have but from their virtues never
you are too wise fernando
to be plain you are in love − nay shrink not man you are bianca is your aim why do you blush
she is i know she is
yes yours i hope i talk no news
fernando know thou runn'st to thy confusion if in time thou dost not wisely shun that circe's charm
i have too long concealed my hidden flames when still in silent signs i courted thee for love without respect to youth or state and yet thou art unkind
fernando leave that sorceress if not for love of me for pity of thyself
injurious woman i defy thy lust
'tis not your subtle sifting that shall creep into the secrets of a heart unsoiled
− you are my prince's sister else your malice had railed itself to death but as for me be record all my fate i do detest your fury or affection − judge the rest
well go thy ways i see the more i humble my firm love the more he shuns both it and me
then 'tis too late to hope − change peevish passion to contempt
whatever rages in my blood i feel fool he shall know i was not born to kneel
another room in the palace
enter d’avolos and julia
julia mine own speak softly
what hast thou learned out any thing of this pale widgeon
speak soft what does she say
foh more than all there's not an hour shall pass but i shall have intelligence she swears
whole nights − you know my mind i hope you'll give the gown you promised me
honest julia peace th'art a woman worth a kingdom
let me never be believed now but i think it will be my destiny to be thy husband at last what though thou have a child − or perhaps two
never but one i swear
well one is that such a matter
i like thee the better for't
it shews thou hast a good tenantable and fertile womb worth twenty of your barren dry bloodless devourers of youth
− but come i will talk with thee more privately the duke has a journey in hand and will not be long absent see 'a is come already − let's pass away easily
exeunt d'avolos and julia
enter duke and bianca
yes i have cause
here was my fate engraven in thy brow this smooth fair polished table in thy cheeks nature summed up thy dower 'twas not wealth the miser's god or royalty of blood advanced thee to my bed but love and hope of virtue that might equal those sweet looks if then thou shouldst betray my trust thy faith to the pollution of a base desire thou wert a wretched woman
speaks your love or fear my lord
bianca know the nightly languish of my dull unrest hath stamped a strong opinion for methought − mark what i say − as i in glorious pomp was sitting on my throne whiles i had hemmed my best beloved bianca in mine arms she reached my cap of state and cast it down beneath her foot and spurned it in the dust whiles i − o 'twas a dream too full of fate
− was stooping down to reach it on my head fernando like a traitor to his vows clapt in disgrace a coronet of horns
− but by the honour of anointed kings were both of you hid in a rock of fire guarded by ministers of flaming hell i have a sword − 'tis here − should make my way through fire through darkness death and all to hew your lust engendered flesh to shreds pound you to mortar cut your throats and mince your flesh to mites i will − start not − i will
mercy protect me will ye murder me
− o i cry thee mercy
− how the rage of my undreamt of wrongs made me forget all sense of sufferance
− blame me not bianca one such another dream would quite distract reason and self humanity yet tell me was't not an ominous vision
'twas my lord yet but a vision for did such a guilt hang on mine honour 'twere no blame in you if you did stab me to the heart
nay strumpet to the soul and tear it off from life to damn it in immortal death
what do you mean sir
− forgive me good bianca still methinks i dream and dream anew now prithee chide me
sickness and these divisions so distract my senses that i take things possible as if they were which to remove i mean to speed me straight to lucca where perhaps absence and bathing in those healthful springs may soon recover me meantime dear sweet pity my troubled heart griefs are extreme yet sweet when i am gone think on my dream
− who waits without
enter petruchio nibrassa fiormonda d’avolos roseilli disguised as before and fernando
is provision ready to pass to lucca
it attends your highness duke
friend hold take here from me this jewël this gives bianca to fernando
be she your care till my return from lucca honest fernando
− wife respect my friend
− let's go − but hear ye wife think on my dream
exeunt all but roseilli and petruchio
cousin one word with you doth not this cloud acquaint you with strange novelties
the duke is lately much distempered what he means by journeying now to lucca is to me a riddle can you clear my doubt
o sir my fears exceed my knowledge yet i note no less than you infer all is not well would 'twere
whosoever thrive i shall be sure never to rise to my unhoped desires
but cousin i shall tell you more anon meantime pray send my lord fernando to me i covet much to speak with him
and see he comes himself i'll leave you both together
the duke is horsed for lucca
to roseilli how now coz how prosper you in love
as still i hoped
− my lord you are undone
lost and i fear your life is bought and sold i'll tell you how
late in my lady's chamber as i by chance lay slumbering on the mats in comes the lady marquess and with her julia and d'avolos where sitting down not doubting me "madam" quoth d'avolos "we have discovered now the nest of shame
" in short my lord − for you already know as much as they reported − there was told the circumstance of all your private love and meeting with the duchess when at last false d'avolos concluded with an oath "we'll make" quoth he "his heart strings crack for this
of you "ay" quoth the marquess "were not the duke a baby he would seek swift vengeance for he knew it long ago
let him know it − yet i vow she is as loyal in her plighted faith as is the sun in heaven but put case she were not and the duke did know she were not this sword lift up and guided by this arm shall guard her from an armèd troop of fiends and all the earth beside
you are too safe in your destruction
− he shall feel − but peace
my lord the duchess craves a word with you
here have a plum for ie'ee − col
come fool i'll give thee plums enow come fool
let slaves in mind be servile to their fears our heart is high instarred in brighter spheres
exeunt fernando and colona
i see him lost already
if all prevail not we shall know too late no toil can shun the violence of fate
the palace the duchess's bedchamber
the curtain is drawn
bianca discovered in her night attire leaning on a cushion at a table holding fernando by the hand
aside now fly revenge and wound the lower earth that i insphered above may cross the race of love despised and triumph o'er their graves who scorn the low bent thraldom of my heart
why shouldst thou not be mine
why should the laws the iron laws of ceremony bar mutual embraces
can there be sin in unity
could i as well dispense with conscience as renounce the outside of my titles the poor style of duchess i had rather change my life with any waiting woman in the land to purchase one night's rest with thee fernando than be caraffa's spouse a thousand years
aside treason to wedlock
this would make you sweat
to survive you or i will see you first or widowèd or buried if the last by all the comfort i can wish to taste by your fair eyes that sepulchre that holds your coffin shall incoffin me alive i sign it with this seal
you shall not swear take off that oath again or thus i will enforce it
use that force and make me perjurèd for whiles your lips are made the book it is a sport to swear and glory to forswear
aside here's fast and loose
which for a ducat now the game's on foot
whilst they are kissing enter the duke and d’avolos with their swords drawn followed by petruchio nibrassa and a guard
madam you are betrayed madam help help
aside to duke is there confidence in credit now sir
belief in your own eyes
do you see sir
can you behold it without lightning
within help madam help
what noise is that
i heard one cry
comes forward ha did you
know you who i am
yes th'art pavy's duke dressed like a hangman see i am unarmed yet do not fear thee though the coward doubt of what i could have done hath made thee steal th’ advantage of this time yet duke i dare thy worst for murder sits upon thy cheeks to't man
i am too angry in my rage to scourge thee unprovided
− take him hence away with him
the guard seize fernando
you must go sir
duke do not shame thy manhood to lay hands on that most innocent lady
− confine him to his chamber
exeunt d’avolos and the guard with fernando
leave us all none stay not one shut up the doors
exeunt petruchio and nibrassa
now shew thyself my brother brave caraffa
woman stand forth before me − wretched whore what canst thou hope for
death i wish no less
you told me you had dreamt and gentle duke unless you be mistook you are now awaked
strumpet i am and in my hand hold up the edge that must uncut thy twist of life dost thou not shake
to see a weak faint trembling arm advance a leaden blade
put up put up thine eyes are likelier much to weep than arms to strike what would you do now pray
rip up the cradle of thy cursèd womb in which the mixture of that traitor's lust imposthumes for a birth of bastardy
yet come and if thou think'st thou canst deserve one mite of mercy ere the boundless spleen of just consuming wrath o'erswell my reason tell me bad woman tell me what could move thy heart to crave variety of youth
i'll tell ye if you needs would be resolved i held fernando much the properer man
can you imagine sir the name of duke could make a crooked leg a scambling foot a tolerable face a wearish hand a bloodless lip or such an untrimmed beard as yours fit for a lady's pleasure
no i wonder you could think 'twere possible when i had once but looked on your fernando i ever could love you again fie fie
now by my life i thought that long ago had known it and been glad you had a friend your wife did think so well of
here's impudence above all history
why thou detested reprobate in virtue durst thou without a blush before mine eyes speak such immodest language
yes 'faith you see i dare i know what you would say now you would fain tell me how exceeding much i am beholding to you that vouchsafed me from a simple gentlewoman's place the honour of your bed 'tis true you did but why
'twas but because you thought i had a spark of beauty more than you had seen
to answer this my reason is the like the self same appetite which led you on to marry me led me to love your friend o he's a gallant man
if ever yet mine eyes beheld a miracle composed of flesh and blood fernando has my voice
i must confess my lord that for a prince handsome enough you are and − and no more but to compare yourself with him
trust me you are too much in fault
shall i advise you
hark in your ear thank heaven he was so slow as not to wrong your sheets for as i live the fault was his not mine
take this take all
the pangs of death are music to this
− forgive me my good genius i had thought i matched a woman but i find she is a devil worser than the worst in hell
− nay nay since we are in e'en come say on i mark you to a syllable you say the fault was his not yours why virtuous mistress can you imagine you have so much art which may persuade me you and your close markman did not a little traffic in my right
look what i said 'tis true for know it now − i must confess i missed no means no time to win him to my bosom but so much so holily with such religiön he kept the laws of friendship that my suit was held but in comparison a jest nor did i ofter urge the violence of my affection but as oft he urged the sacred vows of faith 'twixt friend and friend yet be assured my lord if ever language of cunning servile flatteries entreaties or what in me is could procure his love i would not blush to speak it
such another as thou art miserable creature would sink the whole sex of women yet confess what witchcraft used the wretch to charm the heart of the once spotless temple of thy mind
for without witchcraft it could ne'er be done
− and you be in these tunes sir i'll leave you know the best and worst and all
nay then thou tempt'st me to thy ruin
come black angel fair devil in thy prayers reckon up the sum in gross of all thy veinèd follies there amongst others weep in tears of blood for one above the rest adultery
such a guilt as were the sluices of thine eyes let up tears cannot wash it off 'tis not the tide of trivial wantonness from youth to youth but thy abusing of thy lawful bed thy husband's bed his in whose breast thou sleep'st his that did prize thee more than all the trash which hoarding worldlings make an idol of
when thou shalt find the catalogue enrolled of thy misdeeds there shall be writ in text thy bastarding the issues of a prince
now turn thine eyes into thy hovering soul and do not hope for life would angels sing a requiem at my hearse but to dispense with my revenge on thee 'twere all in vain prepare to die
opens her bosom i do and to the point of thy sharp sword with open breast i'll run half way thus naked − do not shrink caraffa this daunts not me but in the latter act of thy revenge 'tis all the suit i ask at my last gasp to spare thy noble friend for life to me without him were a death
not this i'll none of this 'tis not so fit − casts away his sword
why should i kill her
she may live and change or − fiorm
faint coward dost thou wish to blemish all thy glorious ancestors
is this thy courage
say you so too
− give me thy hand bianca
farewell thus go in everlasting sleep to dwell
the duke draws his poniard and stabs her
here's blood for lust and sacrifice for wrong
tis bravely done thou hast struck home at once live to repent too late
commend my love to thy true friend my love to him that owes it my tragedy to thee my heart to − to − fernando
then whiles thy rage is warm pursue the causer of her trespasses
good i'll slake no time whiles i am hot in blood
takes up his sword and exit
this becomes the state of his disgrace and my unbounded fate
v an apartment in the palace
enter fernando nibrassa and petruchio
to fernando may we give credit to your words my lord
speak on your honour
let me die accursed if ever through the progress of my life i did as much as reap the benefit of any favour from her save a kiss a better woman never blessed the earth
beshrew my heart young lord but i believe thee alas kind lady 'tis a lordship to a dozen points but the jealous madman will in his fury offer her some violence
if it be thus 'twere fit you rather kept a guard about you for your own defence than to be guarded for security of his revenge he is extremely moved
passion of my body my lord if 'a come in his odd fits to you in the case you are he might cut your throat ere you could provide a weapon of defence nay rather than it shall be so hold take my sword in your hand 'tis none of the sprucest but 'tis a tough fox will not fail his master come what will come
take it i'll answer't i in the mean time petruchio and i will back to the duchess' lodging
nibrassa gives fernando his sword
well thought on − and in despite of all his rage rescue the virtuous lady
look to yourself my lord
enter the duke his sword in one hand and a bloody dagger in the other
stand and behold thy executioner thou glorious traitor
i will keep no form of ceremonious law to try thy guilt look here 'tis written on my poniard's point the bloody evidence of thy untruth wherein thy conscience and the wrathful rod of heaven's scourge for lust at once give up the verdict of thy crying villainies
i see th'art armed prepare i crave no odds greater than is the justice of my cause fight or i'll kill thee
duke i fear thee not but first i charge thee as thou art a prince tell me how hast thou used thy duchess
to add affliction to thy trembling ghost look on my dagger's crimson dye and judge
yes by my honour's truth why fool dost think i'll hug my injuries
i'll mix your souls together in your deaths as you did both your bodies in her life
− have at thee
stay i yield my weapon up
fernando drops his sword and kneels
here here's my bosom as thou art a duke dost honour goodness if the chaste bianca be murthered murther me
faint hearted coward art thou so poor in spirit
rise and fight or by the glories of my house and name i'll kill thee basely
do but hear me first unfortunate caraffa thou hast butchered an innocent a wife as free from lust as any terms of art can deify
pish this is stale dissimulatiön i'll hear no more
if ever i unshrined the altar of her purity or tasted more of her love than what without control or blame a brother from a sister might rack me to atomies
i must confess i have too much abused thee did exceed in lawless courtship 'tis too true i did but by the honour which i owe to goodness for any actual folly i am free
'tis false as much in death for thee she spake
by yonder starry roof 'tis true
couldst thou rear up another world like this another like to that and more or more herein thou art most wretched all the wealth of all those worlds could not redeem the loss of such a spotless wife
− glorious bianca reign in the triumph of thy martyrdom earth was unworthy of thee
now on our lives we both believe him
fernando dar'st thou swear upon my sword to justify thy words
i dare look here
fernando kisses the sword
'tis not the fear of death doth prompt my tongue for i would wish to die and thou shalt know poor miserable duke since she is dead i'll hold all life a hell
as virtue's self is good
chaste chaste and killed by me
to her i offer up this remnant of my − the duke offers to stab himself and is stayed by fernando
be gentler to thyself
to the duke alas my lord is this a wise man's carriage
whither now shall i run from the day where never man nor eye nor eye of heaven may see a dog so hateful as i am
had not the fury of some hellish rage blinded all reason's sight i must have seen her clearness in her confidence to die
your leave − kneels holds up his hands and after speaking to himself a little rises
'tis done come friend now for her love her love that praised thee in the pangs of death i'll hold thee dear
− lords do not care for me i am too wise to die yet
the lord abbot of monaco sir is in his return from rome lodged last night late in the city very privately and hearing the report of your journey only intends to visit your duchess to morrow
slave torture me no more
− note him my lords if you would choose a devil in the shape of man an arch arch devil there stands one
− we'll meet our uncle
− order straight petruchio our duchess may be coffined 'tis our will she forthwith be interred with all the speed and privacy you may i' the college church amongst caraffa's ancient monuments some three days hence we'll keep her funeral
− no counsel from our cruël wills can win us but ills once done we bear our guilt within us
exeunt all but d'avolos
" why i am paid
here's bounty for good service
beshrew my heart it is a right princely reward
now must i say my prayers that i have lived to so ripe an age to have my head stricken off
i cannot tell 't may be my lady fiormonda will stand on my behalf to the duke that's but a single hope a disgraced courtier oftener finds enemies to sink him when he is falling than friends to relieve him
i must resolve to stand to the hazard of all brunts now
come what may i will not die like a coward and the world shall know it
v another apartment in the palace
enter fiormonda and roseilli discovered
wonder not madam here behold the man whom your disdain hath metamorphosèd
thus long have i been clouded in this shape led on by love and in that love despair if not the sight of our distracted court nor pity of my bondage can reclaim the greatness of your scorn yet let me know my latest doom from you
roseilli i must honour thee thy truth like a transparent mirror represents my reason with my errors
noble lord that better dost deserve a better fate forgive me if my heart can entertain another thought of love it shall be thine
blessèd forever blessèd be the words
in death you have revived me
aside whom have we here
roseilli the supposed fool
'tis he nay then help me a brazen face
− my honourable lord
bear off bloodthirsty man
come not near me
madam i trust the service − fiorm
fellow learn to new live the way to thrift for thee in grace is a repentant shrift
ill has thy life been worse will be thy end men fleshed in blood know seldom to amend
to fiormonda his highness commends his love to you and expects your presence he is ready to pass to the church only staying for my lord abbot to associate him
− withal his pleasure is that you d'avolos forbear to rank in this solemnity in the place of secretary else to be there as a private man
– pleaseth you to go
exeunt all but d’avolos
as a private man
this way they must come and here i will stand to fall amongst 'em in the rear a sad sound of soft music
the tomb is discovered
enter four with torches after them two friars after the duke in mourning manner after him the abbot flormonda colona julia roseilli petruchio nibrassa and a guard
− d'avolos following behind
coming near the tomb they all kneel making shew of ceremony
the duke goes to the tomb and lays his hand on it
peace and sweet rest sleep here
let not the touch of this my impious hand profane the shrine of fairest purity which hovers yet about those blessèd bones enhearsed within
− if in the bosom of this sacred tomb bianca thy disturbèd ghost doth range behold i offer up the sacrifice of bleeding tears shed from a faithful spring roaring oblations of a mourning heart to thee offended spirit
i confess i am caraffa he that wretched man that butcher who in my enragèd spleen slaughtered the life of innocence and beauty
now come i to pay tribute to those wounds which i digged up and reconcile the wrongs my fury wrought and my contrition mourns
so chaste so dear a wife was never man but i enjoyed yet in the bloom and pride of all her years untimely took her life
− enough set ope the tomb that i may take my last farewell and bury griefs with her
the tomb is opened out of which arises fernando in his winding sheet only his face discovered as the duke is going in fernando puts him back
what art thou that dost rudely press into the confines of forsaken graves
has death no privilege
com'st thou caraffa to practise yet a rape upon the dead
− whats'ever thou intendest know this place is pointed out for my inheritance here lies the monument of all my hopes had eager lust intrunked my conquered soul i had not buried living joys in death
go revel in thy palace and be proud to boast thy famous murthers let thy smooth low fawning parasites renown thy act thou com'st not here
fernando man of darkness never till now before these dreadful sights did i abhor thy friendship thou hast robbed my resolution of a glorious name
come out or by the thunder of my rage thou die'st a death more fearful than the scourge of death can whip thee with
why that's the aim i shoot at 'tis not threats − maugre thy power or the spite of hell − shall rent that honour let life hugging slaves whose hands imbrued in butcheries like thine shake terror to their souls be loth to die
see i am clothed in robes that fit the grave i pity thy defiance
guard lay hands and drag him out
yes let 'em here's my shield fernando holds up a vial of poison
here's health to victory
as the guards go to seize him he drinks off the vial
now do thy worst
once i have outstripped thy plots not all the cunning antidotes of art can warrant me twelve minutes of my life − it works it works already bravely
now now i feel it tear each several joint
split split both heart and gall asunder excellent bane
− roseilli love my memory
− well searched out swift nimble venom
− i come bianca − cruël torment feast feast on do − duke farewell
− thus i − hot flames
− conclude my love − and seal it in my bosom
none stir who steps a foot steps to his utter ruin
− and art thou gone fernando
thou wert a friend unmatched rest in thy fame
− sister when i have finished my last days lodge me my wife and this unequalled friend all in one monument
− now to my vows
never henceforth let any passionate tongue mention bianca's and caraffa's name but let each letter in that tragic sound beget a sigh and every sigh a tear children unborn and widows whose lean cheeks are furrowed up by age shall weep whole nights repeating but the story of our fates whiles in the period closing up their tale they must conclude how for bianca's love caraffa in revenge of wrongs to her thus on her altar sacrificed his life
o hold the duke's hand
save my brother save him
do do i was too willing to strike home to be prevented
− fools why could you dream would outlive my outrage
− sprightful flood run out in rivers
o that these thick streams could gather head and make a standing pool that jealous husbands here might bathe in blood
i grow sweetly empty all the pipes of life unvessel life
− now heavens wipe out the writing of my sin
− bianca thus i creep to thee − to thee − to thee bi−an−ca
he's dead already madam
here's labour saved i could bless the destinies
would i had never seen it
since 'tis thus my lord roseilli in the true requital of your continued love i here possess you of the dukedom and with it of me
in presence of this holy abbot
lady then from my hand take your husband long enjoy joins their hands
each to each other's comfort and content
first thanks to heaven next lady to your love lastly my lords to all and that the entrance into this principality may give fair hopes of being worthy of our place our first work shall be justice
− d'avolos stand forth
i am no lord of thine
− guard take him hence convey him to the prison's top in chains hang him alive − whosoe'er lends a bit of bread to feed him dies
− speak not against it i will be deaf to mercy
− bear him hence
mercy new duke − here's my comfort i make but one in the number of the tragedy of princes
d'avolos is led off
madam a second charge is to perform your brother's testament we'll rear a tomb to those unhappy lovers which shall tell their fatal loves to all posterity
− thus then for you henceforth i here dismiss the mutual comforts of our marriage bed learn to new live my vows unmoved shall stand and since your life hath been so much uneven bethink in time to make your peace with heaven
is this your love
'tis your desert which no persuasion shall remove
'tis fit purge frailty with repentance
i embrace it happy too late since lust hath made me foul henceforth i'll dress my bride bed in my soul
please you to walk lord abbot
no age hath heard nor chronicle can say that ever here befell a sadder day
