the is an asse
that is to day the name of what you are met for a new play
yet grandee’s would you were not come to grace our matter with allowing vs no place
though you presume a subtill thing and may haue heard hee’s worne in a thumbe ring doe not on these presumptions force vs act in compasse of a cheese trencher
this tract will ne’er admit our vice because of yours
anone who worse then you the fault endures that your selues make
when you will thrust and spurne and knocke vs o’ the elbowes and bid turne as if when wee had spoke wee must be gone or till wee speake must all runne in to one like the young adders at the old ones mouth
would wee could stand due north or had no south if that offend or were muscouy glasse that you might looke our scenes through as they passe
we know not how to affect you
if you’ll come to see new playes pray you affoord vs roome and shew this but the same face you haue done your deare delight the diuell of edmunton
or if for want of roome it must mis carry ’twill be but iustice that your censure tarry till you giue some
and when sixe times you ha’ seen’t if this play doe not like the diuell is in’t
hoh hoh hoh hoh hoh hoh hoh hoh &c
and why to earth thou fooolish spirit
what wold’st thou do on earth
for that great chiefe
as time shal work
i do but ask my mon’th
which euery petty pui’nee diuell has within that terme the court of hell will heare some thing may gaine a longer grant perhaps
the laming a poore cow or two
entring a sow to make her cast her farrow
or crossing of a mercat womans mare twixt this and totnam
these were wont to be your maine atchieuements pug you haue some plot now vpon a tonning of ale to stale the yest or keepe the churne so that the buttter come not spight o’ the housewiues cord or her hot spit
or some good ribibe about kentish towne or hogsden you would hang now for a witch because shee will not let you play round robbin and you’ll goe sowre the citizens creame ’gainst sunday
that she may be accus’d for’t and condemn’d by a middlesex iury to the satisfaction of their offended friends the londiners wiues whose teeth were set on edge with it
foolish feind stay i’ your place know your owne strengths and put not beyond the spheare of your actiuity
you are too dull a diuell to be trusted forth in those parts pug vpon any affayre that may concerne our name on earth
it is not euery ones worke
the state of hell must care whom it imployes in point of reputation heere about london
you would make i thinke an agent to be sent for lancashire proper inough or some parts of northumberland so yo’ had good instructions pug
you doe not know deare chiefe what there is in mee
proue me but for a fortnight for a weeke and lend mee but a vice to carry with mee to practice there with any play fellow and you will see there will come more vpon’t then you’ll imagine pretious chiefe
what kind wouldst th’ haue it of
why any fraud or couetousnesse or lady vanity or old iniquity i’ll call him hither
what is he calls vpon me and would seeme to lack a vice
ere his words be halfe spoken i am with him in a trice here there and euery where as the cat is with the mice true vetus iniquitas
lack’st thou cards friend or dice
i will teach thee cheate child to cog lye and swagger and euer and anon to be drawing forth thy dagger to sweare by gogs nownes like a lusty iuuentus in a cloake to thy heele and a hat like a pent house
thy breeches of three fingers and thy doublet all belly with a wench that shall feede thee with cock stones and gelly
is it not excellent chiefe
how nimble he is
child of hell this is nothing
i will fetch thee a leape from the top of pauls steeple to the standard in cheepe and lead thee a daunce through the streets without faile like a needle of spaine with a thred at my tayle
we will suruay the suburbs and make forth our sallyes downe petticoate lane and vp the smock allies to shoreditch whitechappell and so to saint kathernes
to drinke with the dutch there and take forth their patternes from thence wee will put in at custome house key there and see how the factors and prentizes play there false with their masters and gueld many a full packe to spend it in pies at the dagger and the wool sacke
will not this doe chiefe
nay boy i wil bring thee to the bawds and the roysters at belins gate feasting with claret wine and oysters from thence shoot the bridge childe to the cranes i’ the vintry and see there the gimblets how they make their entry
or if thou hadst rather to the strand downe to fall ’gainst the lawyers come dabled from westminster hall and marke how they cling with their clyents together like iuie to oake so veluet to leather ha boy i would shew thee
peace dotard and thou more ignorant thing that so admir’st
art thou the spirit thou seem’st
to choose this for a vice t’aduance the cause of hell now
as vice stands this present yeere
remember what number it is
six hundred and sixteene
had it but beene fiue hundred though some sixty aboue that’s fifty yeeres agone and six when euery great man had his vice stand by him in his long coat shaking his wooden dagger i could consent that then this your graue choice might haue done that with his lord chiefe the which most of his chamber can doe now
but pug as the times are who is it will receiue you
what company will you goe to
or whom mix with
where canst thou carry him
to mount vp ona joynt stoole with a iewes trumpe to put downe cokeley and that must be to citizens
he ne’re will be admitted there where vennor comes
hee may perchance in taile of a sheriffes dinner skip with a rime o’ the table from new nothing and take his almaine leape into a custard shall make my lad maioresse and her sisters laugh all their hoods ouer their shoulders
but this is not that will doe they are other things that are receiu’d now vpon earth for vices stranger and newer and chang’d euery houre
they ride ’hem like their horses off their legges and here they come to hell whole legions of ’hem euery weeke tyr’d
wee still striue to breed and reare ’hem vp new ones but they doe not stand when they come there they turne ’hem on our hands
and it is fear’d they haue a stud o’ their owne will put downe ours
both our breed and trade vvill suddenly decay if we preuent not
vnlesse it be a vice of quality or fashion now they take none from vs
car men are got into the yellow starch and chimney sweepers to their tabacco and strong waters hum meath and obarni
vve must therefore ayme at extraordinary subtill ones now when we doe send to keepe vs vp in credit
get you e’ne backe sir to making of your rope of sand againe
you are not for the manners nor the times they haue their vices there most like to vertues you cannnot know ’hem apart by any difference they weare the same clothes eate the same meate sleepe i’ the selfe same beds rid i’ those coaches
or very like foure horses in a coach as the best men and women
tissue gownes garters and roses fourescore pound a paire embroydred stockings cut worke smocks and shirts more certaine marks of lechery now and pride then ere they were of true nobility
but pug since you doe burne with such desire to doe the common wealth of hell some seruice i am content assuming of a body you goe to earth and visit men a day
but you must take a body ready made pug i can create you none nor shall you forme your selfe an aery one but become subiect to all impression of the flesh you take so farre as humane frailty
so this morning there is a handsome cutpurse hang’d at tiborne whose spirit departed you may enter his body for clothes imploy your credit with the hangman or let our tribe of brokers furnish you
and looke how farre your subtilty can worke thorow those organs with that body spye amongst mankind you cannot there want vices and therefore the lesse need to carry ’hem wi’ you but as you make your soone at nights relation and we shall find it merits from the state your shall haue both trust from vs and imployment
onely thus more i bind you to serue the first man that you meete and him i’le shew you now obserue him
yon’ is hee he shewes fitz dottrel to him comming forth
you shall see first after your clothing
follow him but once engag’d there you must stay and fixe not shift vntill the midnights cocke doe crow
any conditions to be gone
i they doe now name bretnor as before they talk’d of gresham and of doctor fore man francklin and fiske and sauory he was in too but there’s not one of these that euer could yet shew a man the diuell in true sort
they haue their christalls i doe know and rings and virgin parchment and their dead mens sculls their rauens wings their lights and pentacles with characters i ha’ seene all these
but would i might see the diuell
i would giue a hundred o’ these pictures to see him once out of picture
may i proue a cuckold and that’s the one maine mortall thing i feare if i beginne not now to thinke the painters haue onely made him
’slight he would be seene one time or other else
he would not let an ancient gentleman of a good house as most are now in england the fitz dottrel’s runne wilde and call vpon him thus in vaine as i ha’ done this twelue mone’th
if he be not at all why are there coniurers
if they be not why are there lawes against ’hem
the best artists of cambridge oxford middlesex and london essex and kent i haue had in pay to raise him these fifty weekes and yet h’appeares not
’sdeath i shall suspect they can make circles onely shortly and know but his hard names
they doe say h’will meet a man of himselfe that has a mind to him
if hee would so i haue a minde and a halfe for him he should not be long absent
pray thee come i long for thee
an’ i were with child by him and my wife too i could not more
come yet he expresses a longing to see the diuell good beelezebub
were hee a kinde diuell and had humanity in him hee would come but to saue ones longing
i should vse him well i sweare and with respect would he would try mee not as the conjurers doe when they ha’ rais’d him
get him in bonds and send him post on errands
a thousand miles it is preposterous that and i beleeue is the true cause he comes not
and hee has reason
who would be engag’d that might liue freely as he may doe
i sweare they are wrong all
the burn’t child dreads the fire
they doe not know to entertaine the diuell
i would so welcome him obserue his diet get him his chamber hung with arras two of ’hem my own house lend him my wiues wrought pillowes and as i am an honest man i thinke if he had a minde to her too i should grant him to make our friend ship perfect
so i would not to euery man
if hee but heare me now
and should come to mee in a braue young shape and take me at my word
sir your good pardon that i thus presume vpon your priuacy
i am borne a gentleman a younger brother but in some disgrace now with my friends and want some little meanes to keepe me vpright while things be reconcil’d
please you to let my seruice be of vse to you sir
’fore hell my heart was at my mouth till i had view’d his shooes well for those roses were bigge inough to hide a clouen foote
hee lookes and suruay’s his feet ouer and ouer
no friend my number’s full
i haue one seruant who is my all indeed and from the broome vnto the brush for iust so farre i trust him
he is my ward robe man my cater cooke butler and steward lookes vnto my horse and helpes to watch my wife
h’has all the places that i can thinke on from the garret downward e’en to the manger and the curry combe
sir i shall put your worship to no charge more then my meate and that but very little i’le serue you for your loue
i’le harken o’ that eare were i at leasure
but now i’m busie
’pr’y the friend forbeare mee and’ thou hadst beene a diuell i should say somewhat more to thee
thou dost hinder now my meditations
sir i am a diuell
a true diuell s^r
nay now you ly vnder your fauour friend for i’ll not quarrell
i look’d o’ your feet afore you cannot coozen mee your shoo’s not clouen sir you are whole hoof’d
he viewes his feete againe
sir that’s a popular error deceiues many but i am that i tell you
my name is diuell s^r
there’s some omen i’ this
of derby shire s^r
that hole belong’d to your ancestors
yes diuells arse s^r
i’ll entertaine him for the name sake
and turne away my tother man
and saue foure pound a yeere by that
there’s lucke and thrift too
the very diuell may come heereafter as well
friend i receiue you but withall i acquaint you aforehand if yo’ offend mee i must beat you
it is a kinde of exercise i vse
and cannot be without
yes if i doe not offend you can sure
faith diuell very hardly i’ll call you by your surname ’cause i loue it
yonder hee walkes sir i’ll goe lift him for you
to him good ingine raise him vp by degrees gently and hold him there too you can doe it
shew your selfe now a mathematicall broker
i’ll warrant you for halfe a piece
is’t possible there should be such a man
you shall be your owne witnesse i’ll not labour to tempt you past your faith
and is his wife so very handsome say you
i ha’ not seene her since i came home from trauell and they say shee is not alter’d
then before i went i saw her once but so as shee hath stuck still i’ my view no obiect hath remou’d her
’tis a faire guest friend beauty and once lodg’d deepe in the eyes shee hardly leaues the inne
how do’s he keepe her
howeuer himselfe be fordide hee is sensuall that way
in euery dressing hee do’s study her
and furnish forth himselfe so from the brokers
yes that’s a hyr’d suite hee now has one to see the diuell is an asse to day in this ingine gets three or foure pound a weeke by him he dares not misse a new play or a feast what rate soeuer clothes be at and thinkes himselfe still new in other mens old
but stay do’s he loue meat so
faith he do’s not hate it
but that’s not it
his belly and his palate would be compounded with for reason
mary a wit he has of that strange credit with him ’gainst all mankinde as it doth make him doe iust what it list it rauishes him forth whither it please to any assembly’or place and would conclude him ruin’d should hee scape one publike meeting out of the beliefe he has of his owne great and catholike strengths in arguing and discourse
it takes i see h’has got the cloak vpon him
ingine hath won fitzdottrel to ’say on the cloake
a faire garment by my faith ingine
it was neuer made sir for three score pound i assure you ’twill yeeld thirty
the plush sir cost three pound ten shillings a yard
and then the lace and veluet
i shall ingine be look’d at pretitly in it
art thou sure the play is play’d to day
o here’s the bill s^r
hee giues him the play bill
had forgot to gi’t you
i will not lose you sirah
but ingine thinke you the gallant is so furious in his folly
so mad vpon the matter that hee’ll part with’s cloake vpo’ these termes
trust not your ingine breake me to pieces else as you would doe a rotten crane or an old rusty iacke that has not one true wheele in him
doe but talke with him
i shall doe that to satisfie you ingine and my selfe too
with your leaue gentlemen
hee turnes to wittipol
which of you is it is so meere idolater to my wiues beauty and so very prodigall vnto my patience that for the short parlee
of one swift houres quarter with my wife he will depart with let mee see this cloake here the price of folly
sir are you the man
i am that vent’rer sir
your name is witty pol
and ’tis told me yo’ haue trauell’d lately
that i haue s^r
truly your trauells may haue alter’d your complexion but sure your wit stood still
it may well be sir
all heads ha’ not like growth
the good mans grauity that left you land your father neuer taught you these pleasant matches
no nor can his mirth with whom i make ’hem put me off
you are resolu’d then
beauty is the saint you’ll sacrifice your selfe into the shirt too
so i may still cloth and keepe warme your wisdome
you lade me s^r
i know what you wil beare s^r
well to the point
’tis only sir you say to speake vnto my wife
only to speake to her
and in my presence
in your very presence
and in my hearing
in your hearing so you interrupt vs not
for the short space you doe demand the fourth part of an houre i thinke i shall with some conuenient study and this good helpe to boot bring my selfe to’t
hee shrugs himselfe vp in the cloake
i aske no more
please you walk to’ard my house speake what you list that time is yours my right i haue departed with
but not beyond a minute or a second looke for
length and drawing out ma’aduance much to these matches
and i except all kissing
kisses are silent petitions still with willing louers
how falls that o’ your phantsie
i doe know somewhat
i forbid all lip worke
i am not eager at forbidden dainties
who couets vnfit things denies him selfe
you say well sir ’twas prettily said that same he do’s indeed
i’ll haue no touches therefore nor takings by the armes nor tender circles cast ’bout the wast but all be done at distance
loue is brought vp with those soft migniard handlings his pulse lies in his palme and i defend all melting ioynts and fingers that’s my bargaine i doe defend ’hem any thing like action
but talke sir what you will
vse all the tropes and schemes that prince quintilian can afford you and much good do your rhetoriques heart
you are welcome sir
sir i must condition to haue this gentleman by a witnesse
well i am content so he be silent
come diuell i’ll make you roome streight
but i’ll shew you first to your mistresse who’s no common one you must conceiue that brings this game to see her
i hope thou’st brought me good lucke
ingine you hope o’ your halfe piece
friend manly who’s within here
wittipol knocks his friend o’ the brest
i am directly in a fit of wonder what’ll be the issue of this conference
for that ne’r vex your selfe till the euent
how like yo’ him
i would faine see more of him
what thinke you of this
i am past degrees of thinking
old africk and the new america with all their fruite of monsters cannot shew so iust a prodigie
could you haue beleeu’d without your sight a minde so sordide inward should be so specious and layd forth abroad to all the shew that euer shop or ware was
i beleeue any thing now though i confesse his vices are the most extremities i euer knew in nature
but why loues hee the diuell so
for hidden treasure hee hopes to finde and has propos’d himselfe so infinite a masse as to recouer he cares not what he parts with of the present to his men of art who are the race may coyne him
promise gold mountaines and the couetous are still most prodigall
but ha’ you faith that he will hold his bargaine
he will not off on’t
one basenesse still accompanies another
he is heere already and his wife too
a wondrous handsome creature as i liue
mistresse come wife this is the gentleman
why what do you meane sir
ha’ you your reason
wife i do not know that i haue lent it forth to any one at least without a pawne wife or that i’haue eat or drunke the thing of late that should corrupt it
wherefore gentle wife obey it is thy vertue hold no acts of disputation
are you not enough the talke of feasts and meetingy but you’ll still make argument for fresh
why carefull wedlocke if i haue haue a longing to haue one tale more goe of mee what is that to thee deare heart
why shouldst thou enuy my delight
by being solicitous when it not concernes thee
yes i haue share in this
the scorne will fall as bittterly on me where both are laught at
laught at sweet bird
is that the scruple
come come thou art a niaise
a niaise is a young hawke tane crying out of the nest
which of your great houses i will not meane at home here but abroad your families in france wife send not forth something within the seuen yeere may be laught at
i doe not say seuen moneths nor seuen weekes nor seuen daies nor houres but seuen yeere wife
i giue ’hem time
once within seuen yeere i thinke they may doe something may be laught at
in france i keepe me there still
wherefore wife let them that list laugh still rather then weepe for me heere is a cloake cost fifty pound wife which i can sell for thirty when i ha’ seene all london in’t and london has seene mee
to day i goe to the black fryers play house sit ithe view salute all my acquaintance rise vp betweene the acts let fall my cloake publish a handsome man and a rich suite as that’s a speciall end why we goe thither all that pretend to stand for’t o’ the stage the ladies aske who’s that
for they doe come to see vs loue as wee doe to see them now i shall lose all this for the false feare of being laught at
let ’hem laugh wife let me haue such another cloake to morrow
and let ’hem laugh againe wife and againe and then grow fat with laughing and then fatter all my young gallants let ’hem bring their friends too shall i forbid ’hem
no let heauen forbid ’hem or wit if’t haue any charge on ’hem
come thy eare wife is all i’ll borrow of thee
set your watch sir thou onely art to heare not speake a word doue to ought he sayes
that i doe gi’ you in precept no lesse then councell on your wiue hood wife not though he flatter you or make court or loue as you must looke for these or say he raile what ere his arts be wife i will haue thee delude ’hem with a trick thy obstinate silence i know aduantages and i loue to hit these pragmaticke young men at their owne weapons
is your watch ready
here my saile beares for you tack toward him sweet pinnace where’s your watch
he disposes his wife to his place and sets his watch
her modesty seemes to suffer with her beauty and so as if his folly were away it were worth pitty
now th’are right beginne sir
but first let me repeat the contract briefely
hee repeats his contract againe
i am sir to inioy this cloake i stand in freely and as your gift vpon condition you may as freely speake here to my spouse your quarter of an houre alwaies keeping the measur’d distance of your yard or more from my said spouse and in my sight and hearing
this is your couenant
yes but you’ll allow for this time spent now
set ’hem so much backe
i thinke i shall not need it
well begin sir there is your bound sir
not beyond that rush
if you interrupt me sir i shall discloake you
the time i haue purchast lady is but short and therefore if i imploy it thriftily i hope i stand the neerer to my pardon
i am not here to tell you you are faire or louely or how well you dresse you lady i’ll saue my selfe that eloquence of your glasse which can speake these things better to you then and ’tis a knowledge wherein fooles may be as wise as a count parliament
nor come i with any preiudice or doubt that you should to the notice of your owne worth neede least reuelation
shee’s a simple woman know’s not her good who euer knowes her ill and at all caracts
that you are the wife to so much blasted flesh as scarce hath soule in stead of salt to keepe it sweete i thinke will aske no witnesses to proue
the cold sheetes that you lie in with the watching candle that sees how dull to any thaw of beauty pieces and quarters halfe and whole nights sometimes the diuell giuen elfine squire your husband doth leaue you quitting heere his proper circle for a much worse i’ the walks of lincolnes inne vnder the elmes t’expect the feind in vaine there will confesse for you
i did looke for this geere
and what a daughter of darknesse he do’s make you lock’d vp from all society or object your eye not let to looke vpon a face vnder a conjurers or some mould for one hollow and leane like his but by great meanes as i now make your owne too sensible sufferings without the extraordinary aydes of spells or spirits may assure you lady
for my part i protest ’gainst all such practice i worke by no false arts medicines or charmes to be said forward and backward
no i except sir i shall ease you
he offers to discloake him
nor haue i ends lady vpon you more then this to tell you how loue beauties good angell he that waits vpon her at all occasions and no lesse then fortune helps th’ aduenturous in mee makes that proffer which neuer faire one was so fond to lose who could but reach a hand forth to her freedome on the first sight i lou’d you since which time though i haue trauell’d i haue beene in trauell more for this second blessing of your eyes which now i’haue purchas’d then for all aymes else
thinke of it lady be your minde as actiue as is your beauty view your object well
examine both my fashion and my yeeres things that are like are soone familiar and nature ioyes still in equality
let not the signe o’ the husband fright you lady
but ere your spring be gone inioy it
flowers though faire are oft but of one morning
thinke all beauty doth not last vntill the autumne
you grow old while i tell you this
and such as cannot vse the present are not wise
if loue and fortune will take care of vs why should our will be wanting
what doe you answer lady
now the sport comes
let him still waite waite waite while the watch goes and the time runs
nay then i taste a tricke in’t
worthy lady i cannot be so false to mine owne thoughts of your presumed goodnesse to conceiue this as your rudenesse which i see’s impos’d
yet since your cautelous iaylor here stands by you and yo’ are deni’d the liberty o’ the house let me take warrant lady from your silence which euer is interpreted consent to make your answer for you which shall be to as good purpose as i can imagine and what i thinke you’ld speake
no no no no
i shall resume s^r
sir what doe you meane
manly his friend in her place
one interruption more sir and you goe into your hose and doublet nothing saues you
this is for your wife
you must play faire s^r
stand for mee good friend
and speaks for her
troth sir tis more then true that you haue vttred of my vnequall and so sordide match heere with all the circumstances of my bondage
i haue a husband and a two legg’d one but such a moon ling as no wit of man or roses can redeeme from being an asse
h’is growne too much the story of mens mouthes to scape his lading should i make’t my study and lay all wayes yea call mankind to helpe to take his burden off why this one act of his to let his wife out to be courted and at a price proclaimes his asinine nature so lowd as i am weary of my title to him
but sir you seeme a gentleman of vertue no lesse then blood and one that euery way lookes as he were of too good quality to intrap a credulous woman or betray her since you haue payd thus deare sir for a visit and made such venter on your wit and charge meerely to see mee or at most to speake to mee i were too stupid or what’s worse ingrate not to returne your venter
thinke but how i may with safety doe it i shall trust my loue and honour to you and presume you’ll euer husband both against this husband who if we chance to change his liberall eares to other ensignes and with labour make a new beast of him as hee shall deserue cannot complaine hee is vnkindly dealth with
this day hee is to goe to a new play sir
from whence no feare no nor authority scarcely the kings command sir will restraine him now you haue fitted him with a stage garment for the meere names sake were there nothing else and many more such iourneyes hee will make
which if they now or any time heereafter offer vs opportunity you heare sir who’ll be as glad and forward to imbrace meete and enioy it chearefully as you
i humbly thanke you lady
hee shifts to his owne place againe keepe your ground sir
will you be lightned
and but i am by the sad contract thus to take my leaue of you at this so enuious distance i had taught our lips ere this to seale the happy mixture made of our soules
but we must both now yeeld to the necessity
doe not thinke yet lady but i can kisse and touch and laugh and whisper and doe those crowning court ships too for which day and the publike haue allow’d no name but now my bargaine binds me
’twere rude iniury t’importune more or vrge a noble nature to what of it’s owne bounty it is prone to else i should speake but lady i loue so well as i will hope you’ll doe so to
i haue done sir
well then i ha’ won
sir and i may win too
i’ll take carefull order that shee shall hang forth ensignes at the window to tell you when i am absent
or i’ll keepe three or foure foote men ready still of purpose to runne and fetch you at her longings sir
i’ll goe bespeake me straight a guilt caroch for her and you to take the ayre in
yes into hide parke and thence into black fryers visit the painters where you may see pictures and note the properest limbs and how to make ’hem
or what doe you say vnto a middling gossip to bring you aye together at her lodging
vnder pretext of teaching o’ my wife some rare receit of drawing almond milke
it shall be a part of my care
good sir god b’w’you
i ha’ kept the contract and the cloake is mine
why much good do’t you s^r it may fall out that you ha’ bought it deare though i ha’ not sold it
fare you well good sir
wife your face this way looke on me and thinke yo’ haue had a wicked dreame wife and forget it
hee turnes his wife about
this is the strangest motion i ere saw
now wife sits this faire cloake the worse vpon me for my great sufferings or your little patience
they laugh you thinke
and you might see’t
what thought they haue of you may be soone collected by the young genlemans speache
you are in loue with him are you
could he not be nam’d the gentleman without the young
vp to your cabbin againe
my cage yo’ were best to call it
you’ld faine be making blanck manger with him at your mothers
goe get you vp
what say you diuell
heere is one ingine sir desires to speake with you
i thought he brought some newes of a broker
well let him come in good diuell fetch him else
o my fine ingine
no sir the wit the braine the great proiector i told you of is newly come to towne
i ha’ brought him h’is without ere hee pull’d off his boots sir but so follow’d for businesses but what is a proiector
why one sir that proiects wayes to enrich men or to make ’hem great by suites by marriages by vndertakings according as he sees they humour it
can hee not coniure at all
i thinke he can sir
to tell you true but you doe know of late the state hath tane such note of ’hem and compell’d ’hem to enter such great bonds they dare not practice
’tis true and i lie fallow for’t the while
you’ll grow the richer for the rest
i hope i shall but ingine you doe talke somewhat too much o’ my courses
my cloake customer could tell mee strange particulars
how should he haue ’hem else
you do not know s^r what he has and by what arts

what hast thou there

sir there’s not place to gi’ you demonstration of these things
they are a little to subtle

keepe you the land s^r the greatnesse of th’ estate shall throw’t vpon you
if you like better turning it to money what may not you s^r purchase with that wealth
say you should part with two o’ your millions to be the thing you would who would not do’t
as i protest i will out of my diuident lay for some pretty principality in italy from the church now you perhaps fancy the smoake of england rather
but ha’ you no priuate roome sir to draw to t’enlarge our selues more vpon
these sir are bus’nesses aske to be carryed with caution and in cloud
i apprehend they doe so s^r
diuell which way is your mistresse

’tis well o’ the way
your worship takes infinit paines
i loue friends to be actiue a sluggish nature puts off man and kinde
and such a blessing followes it
i thanke my fate
pray you let’s be priuate sir
where none may interrupt vs
you heare diuel lock the streete doores fast and let no one in except they be this gentlemans followers to trouble mee
yo’ haue heard and seene something to day and by it you may gather your mistresse is a fruite that’s worth the stealing and therefore worth the watching
be you sure now yo’ haue all your eyes about you and let in no lace woman nor bawd that brings french masques and cut works
nor old croanes with wafers to conuey letters
nor no youths disguis’d like country wiues with creame and marrow puddings
much knauery may be vented in a pudding much bawdy intelligence they’are shrewd ciphers
nor turne the key to any neyghbours neede be’t but to kindle fire or begg a little put it out rather all out to an ashe that they may see no smoake
or water spill it knock o’ the empty tubs that by the sound they may be forbid entry
say wee are robb’d if any come to borrow a spoone or so
i wi’ not haue good fortune or gods blessing let in while i am busie
i’le take care sir they sha’ not trouble you if they would
mistresse i haue no singular seruice of this now
nor no superlatiue master
i shall wish to be in hell againe at leasure
bring a vice from thence
that had bin such a subtilty as to bring broad clothes hither or transport fresh oranges into spaine
i finde it now my chiefe was i’ the right
can any feind boast of a better vice then heere by nature and art th’are owners of
hell ne’r owne mee but i am taken
the fine tract of it pulls mee along
to heare men such professors growne in our subtlest sciences
my first act now shall be to make this master of mine cuckold the primitiue worke of darknesse i will practise
i will deserue so well of my faire mistresse by my discoueries first my counsells after and keeping counsell after that as who so euer is one i’le be another sure i’ll ha’ my share
most delicate damn’d flesh
that i could stay time now midnight will come too fast vpon mee i feare to cut my pleasure m^rs
looke at the back doore shee sends diuell out
one knocks see who it is
i cannot get this venter of the cloake out of my fancie nor the gentlemans way he tooke which though ’twere strange yet ’twas handsome and had a grace withall beyond the newnesse
sure he will thinke mee that dull stupid creature hee said and may conclude it if i finde not some thought to thanke th’ attemp
he did presume by all the carriage of it on my braine for answer and will sweare ’tis very barren if it can yeeld him no returne
mistresse it is but first let me assure the excellence of mistresses i am although my masters man my misstresse slaue the seruant of her secrets and sweete turnes and know what fitly will conduce to either
i pray you come to your selfe and thinke what your part is to make an answer
tell who is it at the doore
the gentleman m^rs who was at the cloake charge to speake with you this morning who expects onely to take some small command’ments from you what you please worthy your forme hee saies and gentlest manners
you’ll anon proue his hyr’d man i feare what has he giu’n you for this message
sir bid him put off his hopes of straw and leaue to spread his nets in view thus
though they take master fitz dottrell i am no such foule nor faire one tell him will be had with stalking
and wish him to for beare his acting to mee at the gentlemans chamber window in lincolnes inne there that opens to my gallery else i sweare t’acquaint my husband with his folly and leaue him to the iust rage of his offended iealousie
or if your masters sense be not so quicke to right mee tell him i shall finde a friend that will repaire mee
say i will be quiet
in mine owne house
pray you in those words giue it him
this is some foole turn’d
if he be the master now of that state and wit which i allow him sure hee will vnderstand mee i durst not be more direct
for this officious fellow my husbands new groome is a spie vpon me i finde already
yet if he but tell him this in my words hee cannot but conceiue himselfe both apprehended and requited
i would not haue him thinke hee met a statue or spoke to one not there though i were silent
ha’ you told him
and what saies he
that which my self would say to you if i durst
that you are proude sweet mistresse
and with all a little ignorant to entertaine the good that’s proffer’d and by your beauties leaue not all so wise as some true politique wife would be who hauing match’d with such a nupson i speake it with my masters peace whose face hath left t’accuse him now for’t doth confesse him what you can make him will yet out of scruple and a spic’d conscience defraud the poore gentleman at least delay him in the thing he longs for and makes it hs whole study how to compasse onely a title
could but he write cuckold he had his ends
for looke you m^rs
this can be none but my husbands wit
it creaks his ingine the groome neuer durst be else so saucy if it were not clearely his worshipfull ambition and the top of it the very forked top too why should hee keepe you thus mur’d vp in a back roome mistresse allow you ne’r a casement to the streete feare of engendering by the eyes with gallants forbid you paper pen and inke like rats bane
search your halfe pint of muscatell lest a letter be suncke i’ the pot and hold your new laid egge against the fire lest any charme be writ there
will you make benefit of truth deare mistresse if i doe tell it you i do’t not often
i am set ouer you imploy’d indeed to watch your steps your lookes your very breathings and to report them to him
now if you will be a true right delicate sweete mistresse why wee will make a cokes of this wise master we will my mistresse an absolute fine cokes and mock to ayre all the deepe diligences of such a solemne and effectuall asse an asse to so good purpose as wee’ll vse him
i will contriue it so that you shall goe to playes to masques to meetings and to feasts
for why is all this rigging and fine tackle mistris if you neat handsome vessells of good sayle put not forth euer and anon with your nets abroad into the world
it is your fishing
there you shal choose your friends your seruants lady your squires of honour i’le conuey your letters fetch answers doe you all the offices that can belong to your bloud and beauty
and for the variety at my times although i am not in due symmetrie the man of that proportion or in rule of physicke of the iust complexion or of that truth of picardill in clothes to boast a soueraignty o’re ladies yet i know to do my turnes sweet mistresse
i am your slaue your little worme that loues you your fine monkey your dogge your iacke your pug that longs to be stil’d o’ your pleasures
heare you all this
sir pray you come from your standing doe a little spare shee thinkes her husband watches
your selfe sir from your watch t’applaud your squire that so well followes your instructions
mistresse how now sweet heart
you are a stranger to the plot
you set not your fancy diuell here to tempt your wife with all the insolent vnciuill language or action he could vent
did you so diuell
you were not planted i’ your hole to heare him vpo’ the stayres
or here behinde the hangings
i doe not know your qualities
he durst doe it and you not giue directions
you shall see wife whether he durst or no and what it was i did direct
her husband goes out and enters presently with a cudgell vpon him
sweet mistresse are you mad
you most mere rogue
you open manifest villaine
you feind apparant you
you declar’d hel hound
good knaue good rascal and good traitor
now i doe finde you parcel diuell indeed
vpo’ the point of trust
the very day o’ your probation
to tempt your mistresse
you doe see good wedlocke how i directed him
nay there is one blow more for exercise after a pause
he strikes him againe i told you i should doe it
would you had done sir
o wife the rarest man
yet there’s another to put you in mind o’ the last such a braue man wife
within he has his proiects and do’s vent ’hem and againe
would you be acting of the incubus
did her silks rustling moue you
out of my sight
if thy name were not diuell thou shouldst not stay a minute with me
in goe yet stay yet goe too
what i will doe and you shall know’t afore hand
soone as the gentleman is gone doe you heare
i’ll helpe your lisping
wife such a man wife
he has such plots
he will make mee a duke
no lesse by heauen
six mares to your coach wife
and your coach man bald
because he shall be bare inough
doe not you laugh we are looking for a place and all i’ the map what to be of
haue faith be not an infidell
you know i am not easie to be gull’d
i sweare when i haue my millions else
i’ll make another dutchesse if you ha’ not faith
you’ll ha’ too much i feare in these false spirits
o no such thing
this man defies the diuell and all his works
he dos’t by ingine and deuises hee
he has his winged ploughes that goe with sailes will plough you forty acres at once
will spout you water ten miles off
all crowland is ours wife and the fens from vs in norfolke to the vtmost bound of lincoln shire
we haue view’d it and measur’d it within all by the scale
the richest tract of land loue i’ the kingdome
there will be made seuenteene or eighteene millions or more as’t may be handled
wherefore thinke sweet heart if th’ hast a fancy to one place more then another to be dutchesse of now name it i will ha’t what ere it cost if’t will be had for money either here or’n france or italy
you ha’ strange phantasies
where are you sir
i see thou hast no talent this way wife
vp to thy gallery doe chuck leaue vs to talke of it who vnderstand it
i thinke we ha’ found a place to fit you now sir
o no i’ll none
that you say right in
spenser i thinke the younger had his last honour thence
but he was but earle
i know not that sir
but thomas of woodstocke i’m sure was duke and he was made away at calice as duke humphrey was at bury and richard the third you know what end he came too
by m’faith you are cunning i’ the chronicle sir
no i confesse i ha’t from the play bookes and thinke they’are more authentique
what say you to this then he whispers him of a place
no a noble house
i will doe no man wrong
then take one proposition more and heare it as past exception
to be duke of those lands you shall recouer take your title thence sir duke of the drown’d lands or drown’d land
that last has a good sound
i like it well
the duke of drown’d land
yes it goes like groen land sir if you marke it
i and drawing thus your honour from the worke you make the reputation of that greater and stay’t the longer i’ your name
drown’d lands will liue in drown’d land
yes when you ha’ no foote left as that must be sir one day
and though it tarry in your heyres some forty fifty descents the longer liuer at last yet must thrust ’hem out on’t if no quirk in law or odde vice o’ their owne not do’it first
wee see those changes daily the faire lands that were the clyents are the lawyers now and those rich mannors there of good man taylors had once more wood vpon ’hem then the yard by which th’ were measur’d out for the last purchase
nature hath these vicissitudes
shee makes no man a state of perpetuety sir
yo’ are i’ the right
let’s in then and conclude
i my sight againe
i’ll talke with you anon
svre hee will geld mee if i stay or worse pluck out my tongue one o’ the two
this foole there is no trusting of him and to quit him were a contempt against my chiefe past pardon
it was a shrewd disheartning this at first
who would ha’ thought a woman so well harness’d or rather well caparison’d indeed that weares such petticoates and lace to her smocks broad seaming laces as i see ’hem hang there and garters which are lost if shee can shew ’hem could ha’ done this
why is shee so braue
it cannot be to please duke dottrel sure nor the dull pictures in her gallery nor her owne deare reflection in her glasse yet that may be i haue knowne many of ’hem beginne their pleasure but none end it there that i consider as i goe a long with it they may for want of better company or that they thinke the better spend an houre two three or foure discoursing with their shaddow but sure they haue a farther speculation
no woman drest with so much care and study doth dresse her selfe in vaine
i’ll vexe this probleme a little more before i leaue it sure
mistresse this was a fortune happy aboue thought that this should proue thy chamber which i fear’d would be my greatest trouble
this must be the very window and that the roome
i now remember i haue often seene there a woman but i neuer mark’d her much
where was your soule friend
faith but now and then awake vnto those obiects
let mee not liue if i am not in loue more with her wit for this direction now then with her forme though i ha’ prais’d that prettily since i saw her and you to day
hee giues him a paper wherein is the copy of a song
they’ll goe vnto the ayre you loue so well
try ’hem vnto the note may be the musique will call her sooner light shee’s here
either he vnderstood him not or else the fellow was not faithfull in deliuery of what i bad
and i am iustly pay’d that might haue made my profit of his seruice but by mis taking haue drawne on his enuy and done the worse defeate vpon my selfe
manly sings pug enters perceiues it
then he may be there and is sure
is there the enter view
haue i drawne to you at last my cunning lady
the diuell is an asse
nay made an instrument
and could not sent it
well since yo’ haue showne the malice of a woman no lesse then her true wit and learning mistresse i’ll try if little pug haue the malignity to recompence it and so saue his danger
’tis not the paine but the discredite of it the diuell should not keepe a body intire
away fall backe she comes
i’ll leaue you sir the master of my chamber
you make me paint s^r
the’are faire colours lady and naturall
i did receiue some commands from you lately gentle lady this scene is acted at two windo’s as out of two contiguous buildings
but so perplex’d and wrap’d in the deliuery as i may feare t’haue mis interpreted but must make suit still to be neere your grace
who is there with you s^r
none but my selfe
lady to be a deare friends lodging
wherein there’s some conspiracy of fortune with your poore seruants bles affections
who was it sung
he lady but hee’s gone vpon my entreaty of him seeing you approach the window
neither need you doubt him if he were here
he is too much a gentleman
sir if you iudge me by this simple action and by the outward habite and complexion of easinesse it hath to your designe you may with iustice say i am a woman and a strange woman
but when you shall please to bring but that concurrence of my fortune to memory which to day your selfe did vrge it may beget some fauour like excuse though none like reason
no my tune full mistresse
then surely loue hath none nor beauty any nor nature violenced in both these with all whose gentle tongues you speake at once
i thought i had inough remou’d already that scruple from your brest and left yo’ all reason when through my mornings perspectiue i shewd you a man so aboue excuse as he is the cause why any thing is to be done vpon him and nothing call’d an iniury mis plac’d
i’rather now had hope to shew you how loue by his accesses growes more naturall and what was done this morning with such force was but deuis’d to serue the present then
that since loue hath the honour to approach he grows more familiar in his court ship
these sister swelling brests and touch this soft and rosie hand hee hath the skill to draw their nectar forth with kissing and could make more wanton salts from this braue promontory downe to this valley then the nimble roe playes with her paps kisseth her hands &c
could play the hopping sparrow ’bout these nets and sporting squirell in these crisped groues bury himselfe in euery silke wormes kell is here vnrauell’d runne into the snare which euery hayre is cast into a curle to catch a cupid flying bath himselfe in milke and roses here and dry him there warme his cold hands to play with this smooth round and well torn’d chin as with the billyard ball rowle on these lips the banks of loue and there at once both plant and gather kisses
lady shall i with what i haue made to day here call all sense to wonder and all faith to signe the mysteries reuealed in your forme
and will loue pardon mee the blasphemy i vtter’d when i said a glasse could speake this beauty or that fooles had power to iudge it
doe but looke on her eyes
they doe light all that loue’s world comprizeth
doe but looke on her hayre
it is bright as loue’s starre when it riseth
doe but marke her fore head’s smoother then words that sooth her
and from her arched browes such a grace sheds it selfe through the face as alone there triumphs to the life all the gaine all the good of the elements strife
haue you seene but a bright lilly grow before rude hands haue touch’d it
haue you mark’d but the fall of the snow before the soyle hath smuch’d it
haue you felt the wooll o’ the beuer
or swans downe euer
or haue smelt o’ the bud o’ the bryer
or the nard i’ the fire
or haue tasted the bag o’ the bee
o so sweet is shee
her husband appeares at her back
is shee so sir
and i will keepe her so
if i know how or can that wit of man will doe’t i’ll goe no farther
at this windo’ she shall no more be buz’d at
take your leaue on’t
if you be sweet meates wedlock or sweet flesh all’s one i doe not loue this hum about you
a flye blowne wife is not so proper in for you s^r looke to heare from mee
hee speakes out of his wiues window
so i doe sir
no but in other termes
there’s no man offers this to my wife but paies for’t
that haue i sir
nay then i tell you you are
what am i sir
why that i’ll thinke on when i ha’ cut your throat
goe you are an asse
i am resolu’d on’t sir
i thinke you are
to call you to a reckoning
away you brokers blocke you property
s’light if you strike me i’ll strike your mistresse
hee strikes his wife
i could shoote mine eyes at him for that now or leaue my teeth in’him were they cuckolds bane inough to kill him
what prodigious blinde and most wicked change of fortune’s this
i ha’ no ayre of patience an my vaines swell and my sinewes start at iniquity of it
i shall breake breake
the diuell speakes below
this for the malice of it and my reuenge may passe
but now my conscience tells mee i haue profited the cause of hell but little in the breaking off their loues
which if some other act of mine repaire not i shall heare ill of in my accompt
fitz dottrel enters with his wife as come downe
could you do this
and at this time now
when i was so imploy’d wholly for you drown’d i’ my care more then the land i sweare i’haue hope to win to make you peere lesse
studying for footemen for you fine pac’d huishers pages to serue you o’ the knee with what knights wife to beare your traine and sit with your foure women in councell and receiue intelligences from forraigne parts to dresse you at all pieces
y’haue a’most turn’d my good affection to you sowr’d my sweet thoughts all my pure purposes i could now finde i’ my very heart to make another lady dutchesse and depose you
well goe your waies in
diuell you haue redeem’d all
i doe forgiue you
and i’ll doe you good
why ha you these excursions
where ha’ you beene sir
where i ha’ beene vex’d a little with a toy
no toyes must trouble your graue head now it is growing to be great
you must be aboue all those things
nay nay so i will
now you are to’ard the lord you must put off the man sir
you must do nothing as you ha’ done it heretofore not know or salute any man
that was your bed fellow the other moneth
thou dost not know the priueledges ingine follow that title nor how swift to day when he has put on his lords face once then sir for these things i shall doe well enough there is no feare of me
but then my wife is such an vntoward thing
shee’ll neuer learne how to comport with it
i am out of all conceipt on her behalfe
best haue her taught sir
are there any schooles for ladies
is there an academy for women
i doe know for men there was i learn’d in it my selfe to make my legges and doe my postures
doe you remember the conceipt you had the spanish gowne at home
ingine whispers merecraft merecraft turnes to fitz dottrel
i doe thanke thee with all my heart deare ingine
sir there is a certaine lady here about the towne an english widdow who hath lately trauell’d but shee’s call’d the spaniard cause she came latest from thence and keepes the spanish habit
such a rare woman
all our women heere that are of spirit and fashion flocke vnto her as to their president their law their canon more then they euer did to oracle foreman
such rare receipts shee has sir for the face such oyles such tinctures such pomatumn’s such perfumes med’cines quintessences &c
and such a mistresse of behauiour she knowes from the dukes daughter to the doxey what is their due iust and no more
you please me i’ this more then mine owne greatnesse where is shee
let vs haue her
by your patience we must vse meanes cast how to be acquainted good s^r about it
we must think how first
i doe not loue to tarry for a thing when i haue a mind to’t
you doe not know me
if you doe offer it
your wife must send some pretty token to her with a complement and pray to be receiu’d in her good graces all the great ladies do’t
she shall she shall what were it best to be
some little toy i would not haue it any great matter sir a diamant ring of forty or fifty pound would doe it handsomely and be a gift fit for your wife to send and her to take
i’ll goe and tell my wife on’t streight
fitz dottrel goes out
why this is well
the clothes we’haue now but where’s this lady
if we could get a witty boy now ingine that were an excellent cracke i could instruct him to the true height
for any thing takes this dottrel
why sir your best will be one o’ the players
no there’s no trusting them
they’ll talke on’t and tell their poets
what if they doe
the iest will brooke the stage
but there be some of ’hem are very honest lads
there’s dicke robinson a very pretty fellow and comes often to a gentlemans chamber a friends of mine
we had the merriest supper of it there one night the gentlemans land lady invited him to’a gossips feast
now he sir brought dick robinson drest like a lawyers wife amongst ’hem all i lent him cloathes but to see him behaue it and lay the law and carue and drinke vnto ’hem and then talke baudy and send frolicks
it would haue burst your buttons or not left you a seame
they say hee’s an ingenious youth
and dresses himselfe the best
beyond forty o’ your very ladies
did you ne’r see him

but thinke you that we may haue him

make it your owne bounty it will ha’ the better successe what is a matter of fifty pound to you s^r
i’haue but a hundred pieces to shew here that i would not breake you shall ha’ credit sir
i’ll send a ticket vnto my gold smith
heer my man comes too to carry it fitly
your cousin euer ill met me and has beat mee because i would not tell him where you were i thinke he has dogd me to the house too
well you shall goe out at the back doore then traines
you must get guilt head hither by some meanes ’tis impossible
tell him we haue venison i’ll g’ him a piece and send his wife a phesant
a forrest moues not till that forty pound yo’ had of him last be pai’d
he keepes more stirre for that same petty summe then for your bond of sixe and statute of eight hundred
tell him wee’ll hedge in that
cry vp fitz dottrell to him double his price make him a man of mettall
that will not need his bond is current inough
all this is to make you a gentleman i’ll haue you learne sonne
wherefore haue i plac’d you with s^r
poul either side but to haue so much law to keepe your owne
besides he is a iustice here i’ the towne and dwelling sonne with him you shal learne that in a yeere shall be worth twenty of hauing stay’d you at oxford or at cambridge or sending you to the innes of court or france
i am call’d for now in haste by master meere craft to trust master fitz dottrel a good man i’haue inquir’d him eighteene hundred a yeere his name is currant for a diamant ring of forty shall not be worth thirty thats gain’d and this is to make you a gentleman
o but good father you trust too much
boy boy we liue by finding fooles out to be trusted
our shop bookes are our pastures our corn grounds we lay ’hem op’n for them to come into and when wee haue ’hem there wee driue ’hem vp in t’one of our two pounds the compters streight and this is to make you a gentleman
wee citizens neuer trust but wee doe coozen for if our debtors pay wee coozen them and if they doe not then we coozen our selues
but that’s a hazard euery one must runne that hopes to make his sonne a gentleman
i doe not wish to be one truely father
in a descent or two wee come to be iust ’itheir state fit to be coozend like ’hem
and i had rather ha’ tarryed i’ your trade for since the gentry scorne the citty so much me thinkes we should in time holding together and matching in our owne tribes as they say haue got an act of common councell for it that we might coozen them out of rerum natura
i if we had an act first to forbid the marrying of our wealthy heyres vnto ’hem and daughters with such lauish portions
and makes a mungril breed father
and when they haue your money then they laugh at you or kick you downe the stayres
i cannot abide ’hem
i would faine haue ’hem coozen’d but not trusted
o is he come
i knew he would not faile me
welcome good guilt head i must ha’ you doe a noble gentleman a courtesie here in a mere toy some pretty ring or iewell of fifty or threescore pound make it a hundred and hedge in the last forty that i owe you and your owne price for the ring he’s a good man s^r and you may hap’ see him a great one
hee is likely to bestow hundreds and thousands wi’ you if you can humour him
a great prince he will be shortly
what doe you say
in truth sir i cannot
has beene a long vacation with vs
of what i pray thee
those are your citizens long vacations
good father do not trust ’hem
hee will not buy a courtesie and begge it hee’ll rather pay then pray
if you doe for him you must doe cheerefully
his credit sir is not yet prostitute
a pretty youth what’s his name
how came that about
that yeere s^r that i begot him i bought plutarch’s liues and fell s’ in loue with the booke as i call’d my sonne by’his name in hope he should be like him and write the liues of our great men
and you do breed him there
his minde sir lies much to that way
why then he is i’ the right way
but now i had rather get him a good wife and plant him i’ the countrey there to vse the blessing i shall leaue him out vpon’t
and lose the laudable meanes thou hast at home heere t’aduance and make him a young alderman
buy him a captaines place for shame and let him into the world early and with his plume and scarfes march through cheapside or along cornehill and by the vertue’of those draw downe a wife there from a windo’ worth ten thousand pound
get him the posture booke and’s leaden men to set vpon a table ’gainst his mistresse chance to come by that hee may draw her in and shew her finsbury battells
i haue plac’d him with iustice eytherside to get so much law as thou hast conscience
come come thou dost wrong pretty plutarchus who had not his name for nothing but was borne to traine the youth of london in the military truth that way his genius lies
o are you heere sir
’pray you let vs whisper
father deare father trust him if you loue mee
why i doe meane it boy but what i doe must not come easily from mee wee must deale with courtiers boy as courtiers deale with vs
if i haue a businesse there with any of them why i must wait i’am sure on’t son and though my lord dispatch me yet his worshipfull man will keepe me for his sport a moneth or two to shew mee with my fellow cittizens
i must make his traine long and full one quarter and helpe the spectacle of his greatnesse
there nothing is done at once but iniuries boy and they come head long
an their good turnes moue not or very slowly
yet sweet father trust him
vvell i will thinke
come you must do’t sir
i am vndone else and your lady tayle bush has sent for mee to dinner and my cloaths are all at pawne
i had sent out this morning before i heard you were come to towne some twenty of my epistles and no one returne mere craft tells him of his faults
vvhy i ha’ told you o’ this
this comes of wearing scarlet gold lace and cut works
vvith your blowne roses cousin
and your eating phesant and godwit here in london
haunting the globes and mermaides
wedging in with lords still at the table
and affecting lechery in veluet
where could you ha’ contented your selfe with cheese salt butter and a pickled hering the low countries there worne cloth and fustian
beene satisfied with a leape o’ your host’s daughter in garrison a wench of a stoter
or your sutlers wife i’ the leaguer of two blanks
you neuer then had runne vpon this flat to write your letters missiue and send out your priuy seales that thus haue frighted off all your acquaintance that they shun you at distance vvorse then you do the bailies
i come not to you for counsell i lacke money
you doe not thinke what you owe me already
they owe you that meane to pay you
i’ll besworne i neuer meant it
come you will proiect i shall vndoe your practice for this moneth else you know mee
i yo’ are a right sweet nature
well that’s all one
you’ll leaue this empire one day
you will not euer haue this tribute payd your scepter o’ the sword
tye vp your wit doe and prouoke me not will you sir helpe to what i shall prouoke another for you
i cannot tell try me i thinke i am not so vtterly of an ore vn to be melted but i can doe my selfe good on occasions
strike in then for your part
fitz dottrel if i transgresse in point of manners afford mee your best construction i must beg my freedome from your affayres this day
it is in succour of this gentlemans occasions my kins man mere craft pretends businesse
you’ll not do me that affront s^r
i am sory you should so interpret it but sir it stands vpon his being inuested in a new office hee has stood for long mere craft describes the office of dependancy
master of the dependances
a place of my proiection too sir and hath met much opposition but the state now see’s that great necessity of it as after all their writing and their speaking against duells they haue erected it
his booke is drawne for since there will be differences daily ’twixt gentlemen and that the roaring manner is growne offensiue that those few we call the ciuill men o’ the sword abhorre the vapours they shall refer now hither for their processe and such as tresspase ’gainst the rule of court are to be fin’d in troth a pretty place
a kinde of arbitrary court ’twill be sir
i shall haue matter for it i beleeue ere it be long i had a distast
but now sir my learned councell they must haue a feeling they’ll part sir with no bookes without the hand gout be oyld and i must furnish
if’t be money to me streight
i am mine mint and exchequer
no th’ harpey now stands on a hundred pieces
why he must haue ’hem if he will
to morrow sir will equally serue your occasion’s and therefore let me obtaine that you will yeeld to timing a poore gentlemans distresses in termes of hazard
i must get him this money and will
sir i protest i’d rather stand engag’d for it my selfe then you should leaue mee
do you thinke so coursely of our manners that we would for any need of ours be prest to take it though you be pleas’d to offer it
why by heauen i meane it
i can neuer beleeue lesse
but wee sir must preserue our dignity as you doe publish yours
by your faire leaue sir
hee offers to be gone
as i am a gentleman if you doe offer to leaue mee now or if you doe refuse mee i will not thinke you loue mee
sir i honour you
and with iust reason for these noble notes of the nobility you pretend too
but sir i would know why
a motiue he a stranger you should doe this
you’ll mar all with your finenesse why that’s all one if ’twere sir but my fancy
but i haue a businesse that perhaps i’d haue brought to his office
i haue done then if hee can be made profitable to you
yes and it shall be one of my ambitions to haue it the first businesse
so you doe meane to make’t a perfect businesse
nay i’ll doe that assure you shew me once
s^r it concernes the first be a perfect businesse for his owne honour
i and th’ reputation too of my place
why why doe i take this course else
i am not altogether an asse good gentlemen wherefore should i consult you
to make a song on’t
doe satisfie him giue him the whole course
first by request or otherwise you offer your businesse to the court wherein you craue the iudgement of the master and the assistants
well that’s done now what doe you vpon it
we streight s^r haue recourse to the spring head visit the ground and so disclose the nature if it will carry or no
if wee doe finde by our proportions it is like to proue a sullen and blacke bus’nesse that it be incorrigible and out of treaty then
we file it a dependance
i doe loue the order of these things
we then aduise the party if he be a man of meanes and hauings that forth with he settle his estate if not at least that he pretend it
for by that the world takes notice that it now is a dependance
and this we call sir publication
then we grant out our processe which is diuers eyther by chartell sir or ore tenus wherein the challenger and challengee or with your spaniard your prouocador and prouocado haue their seuerall courses i haue enough on’t
for an hundred pieces
yes for two hundred vnder write me doe
your man will take my bond
that he will sure
but these same citizens they are such sharks
there’s an old debt of forty i ga’ my word for one is runne away to the bermudas and he will hooke in that or he wi’ not doe
he whispers fitz dottrell aside
that and the ring and a hundred pieces will all but make two hundred
no no more sir
what ready arithmetique you haue
and then guilt head
a pretty mornings worke for you this
do it you shall ha’ twenty pound on’t
good father do’t you will hooke still
well shew vs your ring
you could not ha’ done this now with gentlenesse at first wee might ha’ thank’d you
but groane and ha’ your courtesies come from you like a hard stoole and stinke
a man may draw your teeth out easier then your money
come were little guilt head heere no better a nature i should ne’r loue him that could pull his lips off now
he pulls plutarchus by the lips
was not thy mother a gentlewoman
and went to the court at christmas and s^t
and lent the lords men chaines
of gold and pearle s^r
i knew thou must take after some body
thou could’st not be else
this was no shop looke
i’ll ha’ thee captaine guilt head and march vp and take in pimlico and kill the bush at euery tauerne
thou shalt haue a wife if smocks will mount boy
you ha’ there now some bristo stone or cornish counterfeit you’ld put vpon vs
he turns to old guilt head
no sir i assure you looke on his luster
hee will speake himselfe
i’le gi’ you leaue to put him i’ the mill h’is no great large stone but a true paragon h’has all his corners view him well
vpo’ my faith s^r o’ the right black water and very deepe
h’is set without a foyle too
here’s one o’ the yellow water i’ll sell cheape
and what do you valew this at
no sir he cost me forty ere he was set
i know your equinocks you’are growne the better fathers of ’hem o’ late
well where’t must goe ’twill be iudg’d and therefore looke you’t be right
you shall haue fifty pound for’t
now to fitz dottrel
not a deneer more
and because you would haue things dispatch’d sir i’ll goe presently inquire out this lady
if you thinke good sir
hauing an hundred pieces ready you may part with those now to serue my kinsmans turnes that he may wait vpon you anon the freer and take ’hem when you ha’ seal’d a game of guilt head
i care not if i do
and dispatch all together
there th’are iust a hundred pieces
ha’ told ’hem ouer twice a day these two moneths
hee turnes ’hem out together
and euerill and hee fall to share
well go and seale then s^r make your returne as speedy as you can
mary and faire too then
i’ll no delaying sir
but you will heare
yes when i haue my diuident
theres forty pieces for you
what is this for
you know that guilt head must ha’ twenty
and what’s your ring there
shall i ha’ none o’ that
o thats to be giuen to a lady
by that good light it is
come gi’ me ten pieces more then
sir do’you thinke i’ll ’low him any such share you must
must doe you your musts sir i’ll doe mine you wi’ not part with the whole sir
gi’ me ten pieces
by what law doe you this
e’n lyon law sir i must roare else
yo’ haue heard how th’ asse made his diuisions wisely
and i am he i thanke you
much good do you s^r
i shall be rid o’ this tyranny one day
not while you doe eate and lie about the towne here and coozen i’ your bullions and i stand your name of credit and compound your businesse adiourne your beatings euery terme and make new parties for your proiects
i haue now a pretty tasque of it to hold you in wi’ your lady tayle bush but the toy will be how we shall both come off
leaue you your doubting
and doe your portion what’s assign’d you i neuer fail’d yet
with reference to your aydes
you’ll still be vnthankfull
where shall i meete you anon
you ha’ some feate to doe alone now i see you wish me gone well i will finde you out and bring you after to the audit
there’s ingines share too i had forgot
this raigne is too too vnsuportable
i must quit my selfe of this vassalage
how goes the cry
here is the gentleman sir
i haue acquainted him
vvhy did you so
vvhy robinson would ha’ told him you know
and hee’s a pleasant wit
will hurt nothing you purpose
then he’is of opinion that robinson might want audacity she being such a gallant
now hee has beene in spaine and knowes the fashions there and can discourse and being but mirth hee saies leaue much to his care but he is too tall
he excepts at his stature
for that he has the brauest deuice
you’ll loue him for’t to say he weares cioppinos and they doe so in spaine
and robinson’s as tall as hee
nay i had rather to trust a gentleman with it o’ the two
pray you goe to him then sir and salute him
sir my friend ingine has acquainted you with a strange businesse here
a merry one sir
the duke of drown’d land and his dutchesse
now that the coniurers ha’ laid him by i ha’ made bold to borrow him a while with purpose yet to put him out i hope to his best vse
for that small part that i am trusted with put off your care i would not lose to doe it for the mirth will follow of it and well i haue a fancy
sir that will make it well
you will report it so
where must i haue my dressing
at my house sir
you shall haue caution sir for what he yeelds to six pence
you shall pardon me
i will share sir your sports onely nothing i’ your purchase
but you must furnish mee with complements to th’ manner of spaine my coach my guarda duenn’as ingine’s your pro’uedor
but sir i must now i’haue entred trust wi’ you thus farre secure still i’ your quality acquaint you with somewhat beyond this
the place design’d to be the scene for this our mery matter because it must haue countenance of women to draw discourse and offer it is here by at the lady taile bushes
i know her sir
and her gentleman huisher
sir it shall be no shame to mee to confesse to you that wee poore gentlemen that want acres must for our needs turne fooles vp and plough ladies sometimes to try what glebe they are and this is no vnfruitefull piece
she and i now are on a proiect for the fact and venting of a new kinde of fucus paint for ladies to serue the kingdome wherein shee her selfe hath trauell’d specially by way of seruice vnto her sexe and hopes to get the monopoly as the reward of her inuention
what is her end in this
merely ambition sir to grow great and court it with the secret though shee pretend some other
for she’s dealing already vpon caution for the shares and m^r
ambler is hee nam’d examiner for the ingredients and the register of what is vented and shall keepe the office
now if shee breake with you of this as i must make the leading thred to your acquaintance that how experience gotten i’ your being abroad will helpe our businesse thinke of some pretty additions but to keep her floting it may be shee will offer you a part any strange names of s^r i haue my instructions
is it not high time to be making ready
the foole’s in sight dottrel
yes here’s the ring i ha’ seal’d
but there’s not so much gold in all the row he saies till’t come fro’ the mint
’tis tane vp for the gamesters
there’s a shop shift
he do’s sweare it
he’ll sweare and forsweare too it is his trade you should not haue left him
s’lid i can goe backe and beat him yet
no now let him alone
i was so earnest after the maine businesse to haue this ring gone
true and ’tis time
i’haue learned sir sin’ you went her ladi ship eats with the lady tail bush here hard by
yes if you’had a seruant now of prefence well cloth’d and of an aëry voluble tongue neither too bigge or little for his mouth that could deliuer your wiues complement to send along withall
i haue one sir a very handsome gentleman like fellow that i doe meane to make my dutchesse vsher i entertain’d him but this morning too i’ll call him to you
the worst of him is his name
she’ll take no note of that but of his message
hee shewes him his pug
how like you him sir
pace go a little
let’s see you moue
he’ll serue s^r giue it him and let him goe along with mee i’ll helpe to present him and it
looke you doe sirah discharge this well as you expect your place
do’you heare goe on come off with all your honours
i would faine see him do it
trust him with it remember kissing of your hand and answering with the french time in flexure of your body
i could now so instruct him and for his words i’ll put them in his mouth
o but i haue ’hem the very academies
sir you’ll haue vse for ’hem anon your selfe i warrant you after dinner when you are call’d
s’light that’ll be iust play time
he longs to see the play
it cannot be i must not lose the play
sir but you must if she appoint to sit
s’lid it is the diuell
because it is the diuell
and ’twere his damme too you must now apply your selfe sir to this wholly or lose all
if i could but see a piece s^r
come but to one act and i did not care but to be seene to rise and goe away to vex the players and to punish their poet keepe him in awe
but say that he be one wi’ not be aw’d
but laugh at you
then he shall pay for his’dinner himselfe
perhaps he would doe that twice rather then thanke you
come get the diuell out of your head my lord i’ll call you so in priuate still and take your lord ship i’ your minde
you were sweete lord he puts him in mind of his quarrell
in talke to bring a businesse to the office
why should not you s^r carry it o’ your selfe before the office be vp
and shew the world you had no need of any mans direction in point sir of sufficiency
i speake against a kinsman but as one that tenders your graces good
i thanke you to proceed to publications ha’ your deed drawne presently
and leaue a blancke to put in your feoffees one two or more as you see cause i thank you heartily i doe thanke you
not a word more i pray you as you loue mee
that i could not thinke o’ this as well as hee
o i could beat my infinite blocke head
he is angry with himselfe
come we must this way
hard by here ouer the way
now to atchieue this ring from this same fellow that is to assure it he thinkes how to coozen the bearer of the ring
before hee giue it
though my spanish lady be a young gentleman of meanes and scorne to share as hee doth say i doe not know how such a toy may tempt his lady ship and therefore i thinke best it be assur’d
sir be the ladies braue wee goe vnto
and shall i see ’hem and speake to ’hem
ha’ you your false beard about you
and is this one of your double cloakes
the best of ’hem
come i must busse offers to kisse
i’ll set thee vp again
neuer feare that canst thou get ne’r a bird
stay till cold weather come i’ll help thee to an ousell or a field fare
who’s within with madame
i’ll tell you straight
she runs in in haste he followes
please you stay here a while sir i’le goe in
i doe so long to haue a little venery while i am in this body
i would tast of euery sinne a little if it might be after the māner of man
what would you s^r
pug leaps at pitfall’s comming in
nothing but fall in to you be your black bird my pretty pit as the gentleman said your throstle lye tame and taken with you here’is gold
to buy you so much new stuffes from the shop as i may take the old vp you must send sir
the gentleman the ring
traine’s in his false cloak brings a false message and gets the ring
nay looke will you be foolish pit
this is strange rudenesse
i’ll call i sweare
mere craft followes presently and askes for it
where are you s^r
is your ring ready
i sent it you
a fellow here e’en now came for it i’ your name
i sent none sure
my meaning euer was you should deliuer it your selfe so was your masters charge you know
train’s as himselfe againe
what fellow was it doe you know him
here but now he had it
not the gentleman saw him
i was so earnest vpon her i mark’d not
the diuell confesseth himselfe coozen’d
my diuellish chiefe has put mee here in flesh to shame mee
this dull body i am in i perceiue nothing with
i offer at nothing that will succeed
sir she saw none she saies
satan himselfe has tane a shape t’abuse me
it could not be else
this is aboue strange
mere craft accuseth him of negligence
that you should be so retchlesse
what’ll you do sir
how will you answer this when you are question’d
run from my flesh if i could put off mankind
this’s such a scorne
and will be a new exercise for my arch duke
woe to the seuerall cudgells must suffer on this backe
can you no succours
the vse of it is so present
i aske sir credit for another but till to morrow
there is not so much time sir
but how euer the lady is a noble lady and will to saue a gentleman from check be intreated mere craft promiseth faintly yet comforts him
to say she ha’s receiu’d it
do you thinke so
will shee be won
no doubt to such an office it will be a lady’s brauery and her pride
and not be knowne on’t after vnto him
that were a treachery
vpon my word be confident
returne vnto your master my lady president sits this after noone ha’s tane the ring commends her seruices vnto your lady dutchesse
you may say she’s a ciuill lady and do’s giue her all her respects already bad you tell her she liues but to receiue her wish’d commandements and haue the honor here to kisse her hands for which shee’ll stay this houre yet
hasten you your prince away
and sir you will take care th’ excuse be perfect
you confesse your feares
the diuel is doubtfull
the shame is more i’ll quit you of either
a pox vpo’ referring to commissioners i’had rather heare that it were past the seales your courtiers moue so snaile like i’ your businesse
wuld i had begun wi’ you
we must moue madame in order by degrees not iump
why there was s^r
iohn monie man could iump a businesse quickely
true hee had great friends but because some sweete madame can leape ditches wee must not all shunne to goe ouer bridges
the harder parts i make account are done he flatters her
you are infinitly bound vnto’the ladies they ha’ so cri’d it vp
doe they like it then
they ha’ sent the spanish lady to gratulate with you i must send ’hem thankes and some remembrances
that you must and visit ’hem
lost to day we cannot heare of him
no in good faith
they say he lay not at home to night
and here has fall’n a businesse betweene your cousin and master manly has vnquieted vs all
so i heare madame
pray you how was it
troth it but appeares ill o’ your kinsmans part
you may haue heard that manly is a sutor to me i doubt not i guess’d it madame
and it seemes he trusted your cousin to let fall some faire reports of him vnto mee
so farre from it as hee came in and tooke him rayling against him
and what said manly to him
inough i doe assure you and with that scorne of him and the iniury as i doe wonder how euerill bore it
but that guilt vndoe’s many mens valors
madame i’ll take my leaue manly offers to be gone
you sha’ not goe i’ faith
i’ll ha’ you stay and see this spanish miracle of our english ladie
let me pray your ladiship lay your commands on me some other time
now i protest and i will haue all piec’d and friends againe
it will be but ill solder’d
you are too much affected with it
i cannot madame but thinke on’t for th’ iniustice
sir his kinsman here is sorry
not i madam i am no kin to him wee but call cousins mere craft denies him
and if wee were sir i haue no relation vnto his crimes
you are not vrged with ’hem
i can accuse sir none but mine owne iudgement for though it were his crime so to betray mee i am sure ’twas more mine owne at all to trust him
but he therein did vse but his old manners and fauour strongly what hee was before
come he will change
faith i must neuer think it
nor were it reason in mee to expect that for my sake hee should put off a nature hee suck’d in with his milke
it may be madam deceiuing trust is all he has to trust to if so i shall be loath that any hope of mine should bate him of his meanes
yo’ are sharp sir
this act may make him honest
if he were to be made honest by an act of parliament i should not alter i’ my faith of him
welcome deare either side
how hast thou done good wench
she spies the lady eyther side
thou hast beene a stranger
i ha’ not seene thee this weeke
to them ever your seruant madame
where hast ’hou beene
i did so long to see thee
visiting and so tyr’d
i protest madame ’tis a monstrous trouble
and so it is
i sweare i must to morrow beginne my visits would they were ouer at court
it tortures me to thinke on ’hem
i doe heare you ha’ cause madam your sute goes on
one that can tell m^r
yes faith there’s life in’t now it is referr’d
if wee once see it vnder the seales wench then haue with ’hem for the great carroch sixe horses and the two coach men with my ambler bare and my three women wee will liue i’ faith the examples o’ the towne and gouerne it
i’le lead the fashion still
you doe that now sweet madame
o but then i’ll euery day bring vp some new deuice
thou and i either side will first be in it
i will giue it thee and they shall follow vs
thou shalt i sweare weare euery moneth a new gowne out of it
thanke you good madame
pray thee call mee taile bush as i thee either side i not loue this madame
then i protest to you taile bush i am glad your businesse so succeeds
thanke thee good eyther side
but master either side tells me that he likes your other businesse better
i neuer heard on’t
h’is one in a word i’ll trust his malice with any mans credit i would haue abus’d
mere craft hath whisper’d with the while
sir if you thinke you doe please mee in this you are deceiu’d
no but because my lady nam’d him my kinsman i would satisfie you what i thinke of him and pray you vpon it to iudge mee
so i doe that ill mens friendship is as vnfaithfull as themselues
ha’ you a businesse about tooth picks
did i ne’r tell’t you
i meant to haue offer’d it your lady ship on the perfecting the pattent
for seruing the whole state with tooth picks the proiect for tooth picks
somewhat an intricate businesse to discourse but i shew how much the subiect is abus’d first in that one commodity
then what diseases and putrefactions in the gummes are bred by those are made of adultrate and false wood
my plot for reformation of these followes
to haue all tooth picks brought vnto an office there seal’d and such as counterfait ’hem mulcted
and last for venting ’hem to haue a booke printed to teach their vse which euery childe shall haue throughout the kingdome that can read and learne to picke his teeth by
which beginning earely to practice with some other rules of neuer sleeping with the mouth open chawing some graines of masticke will preserue the breath pure and so free from taynt ha’ what is’t
traines his man whispers him
good faith it sounds a very pretty bus’nesse
either side saies madame
the lady is come
good waite vpon her in
my ambler was neuer so ill absent
either side how doe i looke to day
am i not drest spruntly
she lookes in her glasse
pox o’ madame will you not leaue that
yes good taile bush
sounds not that better
what vile fucus is this thou hast got on
oyster shells as i breath either side i know’t
here comes they say a wonder sirrah has beene in spaine
will teach vs all shee’s sent to mee from court
to gratulate with mee
pr’y thee let’s obserue her what faults she has that wee may laugh at ’hem when she is gone
that we will heartily tail bush
the very infanta of the giants
wittipol is drest like a spanish lady
here is a noble lady madame come from your great friends at court to see your ladi ship and haue the honour of your acquaintance
she do’s vs honour
pray you say to her ladiship it is the manner of spaine to imbrace onely neuer to kisse
she will excuse the custome
excuses him selfe for not kissing
your vse of it is law
please you sweete madame to take a seate
i’haue had the fauour through a world of faire report to know your vertues madame and in that name haue desir’d the happinesse of presenting my seruice to your ladiship
your loue madame i must not owne it else
both are due madame to your great vndertakings
in troth madame they are my friends that thinke ’hem any thing if i can doe my sexe by ’hem any seruice i’haue my ends madame
and they are noble ones that make a multitude beholden madame the common wealth of ladies must acknowledge from you
except some enuious madame
yo’ are right in that madame of which race i encountred some but lately
who ’t seemes haue studyed reasons to discredit your businesse
nay the parties wi’ not be worth your pause most ruinous things madame that haue put off all hope of being recouer’d to a degree of handsomenesse
but their reasons madame
i would faine heare
some madame i remember
they say that painting quite destroyes the face o that’s an old one madame
there are new ones too
corrupts the breath hath left so little sweetnesse in kissing as ’tis now vs’d but for fashion and shortly will be taken for a punishment
decayes the fore teeth that should guard the tongue and suffers that runne riot euer lasting
and which is worse some ladies when they meete cannot be merry and laugh but they doe spit in one anothers faces
i should know this voyce and face too manly begins to know him
then they say ’tis dangerous to all the falne yet well dispos’d mad dames that are industrious and desire to earne their liuing with their sweate
for any distemper of heat and motion may displace the colours and if the paint once runne about their faces twenty to one they will appeare so ill fauour’d their seruants run away too and leaue the pleasure imperfect and the reckoning all vnpay’d
pox these are poets reasons
some old lady that keepes a poet has deuis’d these scandales
faith we must haue the poets banish’d madame as master either side saies
and his wife where
madame the duke of drown’d land that will be shortly
is this my lord
offended that i haue found your haunt here
wittipol whispers with manly
no but wondring at your strange fashion’d venture hither
it is to shew you what they are you so pursue
i thinke ’twill proue a med’cine against marriage to know their manners
stay and profit then
the lady madame whose prince has brought her here to be instructed
hee presents mistresse fitz dottrel
please you sit with vs lady
i cannot see the ring though
sir she has it
but madame these are very feeble reasons
so i vrg’d madame that the new complexion now to come forth in name o’ your ladiship’s fucus had no ingredient but i durst eate i assure you
so do they in spaine
sweet madam be so liberall to giue vs some o’ your spanish fucuses
they are infinit madame
so i heare they haue vvater of gourdes of radish the white beanes flowers of glasse of thistles rose marine
raw honey mustard seed and bread dough bak’d the crums o’ bread goats milke and whites of egges campheere and lilly roots the fat of swannes marrow of veale white pidgeons and pine kernells the seedes of nettles perse’line and hares gall
limons thin skind how her ladiship has studied al excellent things
no the true rarities are th’ aluagada and argentata of queene isabella
i what are their ingredients gentle madame
your allum scagliola or pol dipedra and zuccarino turpentine of abezzo wash’d in nine waters soda di leuante or your ferne ashes beniamin di gotta grasso di serpe porcelletto marino oyles of lentisco zucche mugia make the admirable vernish for the face giues the right luster but two drops rub’d on vvith a piece of scarlet makes a lady of sixty looke at sixteen
but aboue all the water of the white hen of the lady estifanias
o i that same good madame i haue heard of how is it done
madame you take your hen plume it and skin it cleanse it o’ the inwards then chop it bones and all adde to foure ounces of carrauicins pipitas sope of cyprus make the decoction streine it
then distill it and keep it in your galley pot well glidder’d three drops preserues from wrinkles warts spots moles blemish or sun burnings and keepes the skin in decimo sexto euer bright and smooth as any looking glasse and indeed is call’d the virgins milke for the face oglio reale a ceruse neyther cold or heat will hurt and mixt with oyle of myrrhe and the red gilli flower call’d cataputia and flowers of rouistico makes the best muta or dye of the whole world
deare madame will you let vs be familiar
how do you like her
but yet i cannot see the ring
hee is iealous about his ring and mere craft deliuers it
i must deliuer it or marre all
this foole’s so iealous
madame sir weare this ring and pray you take knowledge ’twas sent you by his wife
and giue her thanks doe not you dwindle sir beare vp
i thanke you sir
but for the manner of spaine
sweet madame let vs be bold now we are in are all the ladies there i’ the fashion
none but grandee’s madame the clasp’d traine which may be worne at length too or thus vpon my arme
and doe they weare cioppino’s all
if they be drest in punto madame
guilt as those are
of goldsmiths work madame and set with diamants and their spanish pumps of perfum’d leather
i should thinke it hard to go in ’hem madame
at the first it is madame
do you neuer fall in ’hem
i sweare i should six times an houre
but you haue men at hand sstill to helpe you if you fall
onely one madame the guardo duennas such a little old man as this
hee can doe nothing
i’ll tell you madame i saw i’ the court of spaine once a lady fall i’ the kings sight along and there shee lay flat spred as an vmbrella her hoope here crack’d no man durst reach a hand to helpe her till the guarda duenn’as came vvho is the person onel’ allow’d to touch a lady there and he but by this finger
ha’ they no seruants madame there
an escudero or so madame that wayts vpon ’hem in another coach at distance and when they walke or daunce holds by a hand kercher neuer presumes to touch ’hem
and a forc’d grauity
i doe not like it
i like our owne much better
’tis more french and courtly ours
and tasts more liberty
vve may haue our doozen of visiters at once make loue t’vs
and before our husbands
as i am honest tayle bush i doe thinke if no body should loue mee but my poore husband i should e’n hang my selfe
fortune forbid wench so faire a necke should haue so foule a neck lace
’tis true as i am handsome
i receiu’d lady a token from you which i would not bee rude to refuse being your first remembrance
o i am satisfied now
do you see it sir
but since you come to know me neerer lady i’ll begge the honour you will weare for mee it must be so
wittipol giues it mistresse fitz dottrel
sure i haue heard this tongue
what do you meane s^r
mere craft murmures would you ha’ me mercenary
we’ll recompence it anon in somewhat else
he is satisfied now he sees it
i doe not loue to be gull’d though in a toy
vvife doe you heare
yo’ are come into the schole wife vvhere you may learne i doe perceiue it any thing
how to be fine or faire or great or proud or what you will indeed wife heere ’tis taught
and i am glad on’t that you may not say another day when honours come vpon you you wanted meanes
i ha’ done my parts beene today at fifty pound charge first for a ring he vpbraids her with his bill of costs
to get you entred
then left my new play to wait vpon you here to see’t confirm’d
that i may say both to mine owne eyes and eares senses you are my witnesse sha’ hath inioy’d all helps that could be had for loue or money m^rs
to make a foole of her
wife that’s your malice the wickednesse o’ you nature to interpret your husbands kindesse thus
but i’ll not leaue still to doe good for your deprau’d affections intend it
bend this stubborne will be great
good madame whom do they vse in messages
they comonly vse their slaues madame
and do’s your ladiship
thinke that so good madame
no indeed madame i therein preferre the fashion of england farre of your young delicate page or discreet vsher
and i goe with your ladiship in opinion directly for your gentleman vsher
there’s not a finer officer goes on ground
if hee be made and broken to his place once
nay so i presuppose him
and they are fitter managers too sir but i would haue ’hem call’d our escudero’s
say i should send to your ladiship who i presume has gather’d all the deare secrets to know how to make pastillos of the dutchesse of braganza coquettas almoiauana’s mantecada’s alcoreas mustaccioli or say it were the peladore of isabella or balls against the itch or aqua nanfa or oyle of iessamine for gloues of the marquesse muja or for the head and hayre why these are offices
fit for a gentleman not a slaue
they onely might aske for your pineti spanish cole to burne and sweeten a roome but the arcana of ladies cabinets should be else where trusted
yo’ are much about the truth
sweet honoured ladies he enters himselfe with the ladies
let mee fall in wi’ you
i’ha’ my female wit as well as my male
and i doe know what sutes a lady of spirit or a woman of fashion
and you would haue your wife such
yes madame aërie light not to plaine dishonesty i meane but somewhat o’ this side
i take you sir
i’ll not giue this rush for any lady that cannot be honest within a thred
yes madame and yet venter as far for th’other in her fame as can be coach it to pimlico daunce the saraband heare and talke bawdy laugh as loud as a larum squeake spring do any thing
in young company madame
if they be braue or lords a woman is ingag’d
i say so ladies it is ciuility to deny vs nothing
you talke of a vniuersity
why hell is a grammar schoole to this
the diuell admires him
but then shee must not lose a looke on stuffes or cloth madame
nor no course fellow
she must be guided madame by the clothes he weares and company he is in whom to salute how farre i ha’ told her this
and how that bawdry too vpo’ the point is in it selfe as ciuill a discourse as any other affayre of flesh what euer
but shee will ne’r be capable shee is not so much as comming madame i know not how she loses all her opportunities with hoping to be forc’d
i’haue entertain’d he shews his pug
a gentleman a younger brother here whom i would faine breed vp her escudero against some expectation’s that i haue and she’ll not countenance him
diuel o’ darbi shire
blesse us from him
call him de uile sweet madame
what you please ladies
de uile’s a prettier name
and sounds me thinks as it came in with the conquerour ouer smocks
what things they are
that nature should be at leasure euer to make ’hem
my woing is at an end
manly goes out with indignation
what can he do
please you to try him ladies
was all this but the preface to my torment
come let their ladiships see your honours
o hee makes a wicked leg
as euer i saw
fit for a diuell
good madame call him de uile
de uile what property is there most required your conceit now in the escudero
they begin their catechisme
why doe you not speake
a setled discreet pase madame
i thinke a barren head sir mountaine like to be expos’d to the cruelty of weathers i for his valley is beneath the waste madame and to be fruitfull there it is sufficient
could not you hit this
good sir he strikes him
he then had had no barren head
you daw him too much in troth sir
i must walke with the french sticke like an old vierger for you
o chiefe call mee to hell againe and free mee
do you murmur now
what do you take m^r
deuile the height of your employment in the true perfect escudero
what doe you answer
to be able madame first to enquire then report the working of any ladies physicke in sweete phrase
yes that’s an act of elegance and importance
o that i had a goad for him
to find out a good corne cutter
why did you doe this now
of purpose to discredit me
sure if i be not yet i shall be
all my daies in hell were holy daies to this
’tis labour lost madame
h’is a dull fellow of no capacity
o if my ambler had beene here
i madame you talke of a man where is there such another
deuile put case one of my ladies heere had a fine brach and would imploy you forth to treate ’bout a conuenient match for her
what would you obserue
the color and the size madame
the moon you calfe the moone
i and the signe
yes and receits for pronenesse
then when the puppies came what would you doe
get their natiuities cast
consult the almanack man which would be least
and while she were with puppy
walke her out and ayre her euery morning
and be industrious to kill her fleas
he will make a pretty proficient
who comming from hell could looke for such catechising
the diuell is an asse
i doe acknowledge it
the top of woman
all her sexe in abstract
fitz dottrel admires wittipol
i loue her to each syllable falls from her
good madame giue me leaue to goe aside with him
and try him a little
do and i’ll with draw madame vvith this faire lady read to her the while
deare chiefe relieue me or i perish
the diuel praies again
you are not iealous sir
stay wife behold i giue her vp heere absolutely to you she is your owne
do with her what you will
he giues his wife to him taking him to be a lady
melt cast and forme her as you shall thinke good
set any stamp on
i’ll receiue her from you as a new thing by your owne standard
but what ha’ you done i’ your dependance since
o it goes on i met your cousin the master you did not acquaint him s^r
faith but i did s^r
and vpon better thought not without reason
he being chiefe officer might ha’ tane it ill else as a contempt against his place and that in time sir ha’ drawne on another dependance
no i did finde him in good termes and ready to doe me any seruice
so he said to you
but s^r you do not know him
vvhy i presum’d because this bus’nesse of my wiues requir’d mee i could not ha’ done better and hee told me that he would goe presently to your councell a knight here i’ the lane yes iustice either side
and get the feoffment drawne with a letter of atturney for liuerie and seisen
that i knowe’s the course
but sir you meane not to make him feoffee
nay that i’ll pause on
how now little pit fall
your cousin master euer ill would come in but he would know if master manly were heere
no tell him if he were i ha’ made his peace
mere craft whispers against him
hee’s one sir has no state and a man knowes not how such a trust may tempt him
this same deed is done here
art thou come with it
and has sir paul view’d it
his hand is to the draught
vvill you step in s^r
i pray you a word wi’ you
eueril whispers against mere craft
sir paul eitherside will’d mee gi’ you caution whom you did make feoffee for ’tis the trust your whole state and though my cousin heere be a worthy gentleman yet his valour has at the tall board bin question’d and we hold any man so impeach’d of doubtfull honesty
i will not iustisie this but giue it you to make your profit of it if you vtter it i can forsweare it
i beleeue you and thanke you sir
mistresse be not afraid sweet lady yo’ are trusted to loue not violence here i am no rauisher but one whom you by your faire trust againe may of a seruant make a most true friend
and such a one i need but not this way sir i confesse me to you the meere manner of your attempting mee this morning tooke mee and i did hold m’inuention and my manners were both engag’d to giue it a requitall but not vnto your ends my hope was then though interrupted ere it could be vtter’d that whom i found the master of such language that braine and spirit for such an enterprise could not but if those succours were demanded to a right vse employ them vertuously
and make that profit of his noble parts which they would yeeld
s^r you haue now the ground to exercise them in i am a woman that cannot speake more wretchednesse of my selfe then you can read match’d to a masse of folly that euery day makes haste to his owne ruine the wealthy portion that i brought him spent and through my friends neglect no ioynture made me
my fortunes standing in this precipice ’tis counsell that i want and honest aides and in this name i need you for a friend
neuer in any other for his ill must not make me s^r worse
manly conceal’d this while shews himself
forsake not the braue occasion vertue offers you to keepe you innocent i haue fear’d for both and watch’d you to preuent the ill i fear’d
but since the weaker side hath so assur’d mee let not the stronger fall by his owne vice or be the lesse a friend cause vertue needs him
vertue shall neuer aske my succours twice most friend most man your counsells are commands lady i can loue goodnes in you more then i did beauty and doe here intitle your vertue to the power vpon a life you shall engage in any fruitfull seruice euen to forfeit
madame do you heare sir mere craft takes wittipol aside & moues a proiect for himselfe
we haue another leg strain’d for this dottrel
he’ha’s a quarrell to carry and ha’s caus’d a deed of feoffment of his whole estate to be drawne yonder h’ha’st within and you onely he meanes to make feoffee
h’is falne so desperatly enamour’d on you and talkes most like a mad man you did neuer heare a phrentick so in loue with his owne fauour
now you doe know ’tis of no validity in your name as you stand therefore aduise him to put in me
h’is come here you shall share sir
mistresse madame i haue a suit to you and afore hand i doe bespeake you you must not deny me i will be graunted
sir i must know it though
no lady you must not know it yet you must too
for the trust of it and the fame indeed which else were lost me
i would vfe your name but in a feoffment make my whole estate ouer vnto you a trifle a thing of nothing some eighteene hundred
i vnderstand not those things sir
i am a woman and most loath to embarque my selfe you will not slight me madame
nor you’ll not quarrell me
no sweet madame i haue already a dependance for which cause i doe this let me put you in deare madame i may be fairely kill’d
you haue your friends sir about you here for choice
she tells you right sir
hee hopes to be the man
death if she doe what do i care for that
say i would haue her tell me wrong
why sir if for the trust you’ll let me haue the honor to name you one
nay you do me the honor madame who is’t
this gentleman shee designes manly
o no sweet madame h’is friend to him with whom i ha’ the dependance
who might he bee
one wittipol do you know him
alas sir he a toy this gentleman a friend to him
no more then i am sir
but will your ladyship vndertake that madame
yes and what else for him you will engage me
what is his name
his name is eustace manly
vvhence do’s he write himselfe
of middle sex esquire
clerke come hether vvrite eustace manly squire o’ middle sex
what ha’ you done sir
nam’d a gentleman that i’ll be answerable for to you sir
had i nam’d you it might ha’ beene suspected this way ’tis safe
come gentlemen your hands for witnes
you ha’ made election eueril applaudes it
of a most worthy gentleman
vvould one of worth had spoke it whence it comes it is rather a shame to me then a praise
sir i will giue you any satisfaction
be silent then falshood commends not truth
you do deliuer this sir as your deed
to th’ vse of m^r
yes and sir vvhen did you see yong wittipol
i am ready for processe now sir this is publication
he shall heare from me he would needes be courting my wife sir
yes so witnesseth his cloake there
nay good sir madame you did vndertake fitz dottrel is suspicious of manly still
that he was not wittipols friend
no confession of it
o she know’s not now i remember madame
this young wittipol vvould ha’ debauch’d my wife and made me cuckold through a casement he did fly her home to mine owne window but i think i sou’t him and rauifh’d her away out of his pownces
i ha’ sworne to ha’ him by the eares i feare the toy wi’ not do me right
vvhat right doe you aske sir
here he is will do’t you
i sir no more lady now nor spaniard
no indeed ’tis wittipol
am i the thing i fear’d
no sir but you were late in possibility i’ll tell you so much
but your wife’s too vertuous
vvee’ll see her sir at home and leaue you here to be made duke o’ shore ditch with a proiect
crie but another note sir i’ll marre the tune o’ your pipe
gi’ me my deed then
he would haue his deed again
neither that shall be kept for your wiues good vvho will know better how to vse it
ha’ to feast you with my land
sir be you quiet or i shall gag you ere i goe consult your master of dependances how to make this a second businesse you haue time sir
vvitipol bafflees him and goes out
vvhat will the ghost of my wise grandfather my learned father with my worshipfull mother thinke of me now that left me in this world in state to be their heire
that am become a cuckold and an asse and my wiues ward likely to loose my land ha’ my throat cut all by her practice
sir we are all abus’d
and be so still
vvho hinders you i pray you let me alone i would enioy my selfe and be the duke o’ drown’d land you ha’ made me
sir we must play an after game o’ this
but i am not in case to be a gam ster i tell you once againe you must be rul’d and take some counsell
sir i do hate counsell as i do hate my wife my wicked wife
but we may thinke how to recouer all if you will act
i will not think nor act nor yet recouer do not talke to me
i’ll runne out o’ my witts rather then heare i will be what i am fabian fitz dottrel though all the world say nay to’t
bvt ha’s my lady mist me
here ha’s been that infinity of strangers
and then she would ha’ had you to ha’ sampled you vvith one within that they are now a teaching and do’s pretend to your ranck
good fellow pit fall tel m^r
mere craft i intreat a word with him
this most vnlucky accident will goe neare to be the losse o’ my place i am in doubt
what say you m^r ambler
sir i would beseech your worship stand betweene me and my ladies displeasure for my absence
o is that all
i would tell you sir but how it happened
brief good master ambler put your selfe to your rack for i haue tasque of more importance
mere craft seemes full of businesse
sir you’ll laugh at me
but so is truth a very friend of mine finding by conference with me that i liu’d too chast for my complexion and indeed too honest for my place sir did aduise me if i did loue my selfe as that i do i must confesse spare your parenthesis
to gi’ my body a little euacuation well and you went to a whore
i durst not for feare it might arriue at some body’s eare it should not trust my selfe to a common house ambler tels this with extraordinary speed
but got the gentlewoman to goe with me and carry her bedding to a conduit head hard by the place toward tyborne which they call my majors banqueting house
now sir this morning was execution and i ner’e dream’t on’t till i heard the noise o’ the people and the horses and neither i nor the poore gentlewoman durst stirre till all was done and past so that the interim we fell a sleepe againe
nay if you fall from your gallop i am gone s^r
but when i wak’d to put on my cloathes a sute i made new for the action it was gone and all my money with my purse my seales my hard wax and my table bookes my studies and a fine new deuise i had to carry my pen and inke my ciuet and my tooth picks all vnder one
but that which greiu’d me was the gentlewoman’s shoes with a paire of roses and garters i had giuen her for the businesse so as that made vs stay till it was darke
for i was faine to lend her mine and walke in a rug by her barefoote to saint giles’es
a kind of irish penance
is this all sir
to satisfie my lady
i will promise you s^r
i ha’ told the true disaster
i cannot stay wi’ you sir to condole but gratulate your returne
an honest gentleman but he’s neuer at leisure to be himselfe he ha’s such tides of businesse
o call me home againe deare chiefe and put me to yoaking foxes milking of hee goates pounding of water in a morter lauing the sea dry with a nut shell gathering all the leaues are falne this autumne drawing farts out of dead bodies making ropes of sand catching the windes together in a net mustring of ants and numbring atomes all that hell and you thought exquisite torments rather then stay me here a thought more i would sooner keepe fleas within a circle and be accomptant a thousand yeere which of ’hem and how far out leap’d the other then endure a minute such as i haue within
there is no hell to a lady of fashion
all your torture there are pastimes to it
would be a refreshing for me to be i’ the fire againe from hence
ambler comes in & suruayes him
this is my suite and those the shoes and roses
th’ haue such impertinent vexations a generall councell o’ diuels could not hit pug perceiues it and starts
this is hee i tooke a sleepe with his wench and borrow’d his cloathes
what might i doe to balke him
do you heare s^r
him but not to th’purpose what is your name i pray you sir
is’t so late sir
he answers quite from the purpose
i aske not o’ the time but of your name sir
i thanke you sir
yes it dos hold sir certaine
i must both hold and talke to you about these clothes

or do not i speake to him what i meane
good sir your name
only a couple a’ cocks sir if we can get a widgin ’tis in season
he hopes to make on o’ these scipticks o’ me for scepticks
i thinke i name ’hem right and do’s not fly me
i wonder at that
’tis a strange confidence
i’ll prooue another way to draw his answer
it is the easiest thing sir to be done
as plaine as fizzling roule but wi’ your eyes and foame at th’ mouth
a little castle soape will do’t to rub your lips and then a nutshell with toe and touch wood in it to spit fire did you ner’e read sir little darrels tricks with the boy o’ burton and the
in lancashire sommers at nottingham
all these do teach it
and wee’ll giue out sir that your wife ha’s bewitch’d you they repaire their old plot
and practised with those two as sorcerers
and ga’ you potions by which meanes you were not compos mentis when you made your feoffment
there’s no recouery o’ your state but this this sir will sting
and moue in a court of equity
for it is more then manifest that this was a plot o’ your wiues to get your land
nay and my cossen has knowne these gallants in these shapes
t’haue don strange things sir
one as the lady the other as the squire
how a mans honesty may be fool’d
i thought him a very lady
so did i renounce me else
but this way sir you’ll be reueng’d at height
yes faith and since your wife has runne the way of woman thus e’en giue her lost by this hand to me dead to all ioyes of her deare dottrell i shall neuer pitty her that could pitty her selfe
princely resolu’d sir and like your selfe still in potentiâ
gvilt head what newes
o sir my hundred peices let me ha’ them yet
fitz dottrel askes for his money
yes sir officers arrest him
keepe the peace i charge you gentlemen
for better security sir
my sonne plutarchus assures me y’are not worth a groat
pardon me father i said his worship had no foote of land left and that i’ll iustifie for i writ the deed
ha’ you these tricks i’ the citty
arrest this gallant too here at my suite
i and at mine
he owes me for his lodging two yeere and a quarter
why guilt head land lord thou art not mad though th’art constable puft vp with th’ pride of the place
do you heare sirs
haue i deseru’d this from you two
for all my paines at court to get you each a patent
vpo’ my proiect o’ the forkes forkes
the project of forks
the laudable vse of forkes brought into custome here as they are in italy to th’ sparing o’ napkins
that that should haue made your bellowes goe at the forge as his at the fornace
i ha’ procur’d it ha’ the signet for it dealt with the linnen drapers on my priuate by cause i fear’d they were the likelyest euer to stirre against to crosse it for ’twill be a mighty sauer of linnen through the kingdome as that is one o’ my grounds and to spare washing now on you two had i layd all the profits
guilt head to haue the making of all those of gold and siluer for the better personages and you of those of steele for the common sort
and both by pattent i had brought you your seales in
but now you haue preuented me and i thanke you

our cheife doth salute thee and least the coldyron should chance to confute thee h’hath sent thee grant paroll by me to stay longer a moneth here on earth against cold child or honger
longer here a moneth
yes boy till the session that so thou mayest haue a triumphall egression

and in the meane time to be greazy and bouzy and nasty and filthy and ragged and louzy with dam’n me renounce me and all the fine phrases that bring vnto tiborne the plentifull gazes
he is a diuell
and may be our cheife
the great superiour diuell
for his malice arch diuel
he knew what i would suffer when he tie’d me vp thus in a rogues body and he has i thanke him his tyrannous pleasure on me to confine me to the vnlucky carkasse of a cutpurse wherein i could do nothing
the great deuill enters and vpbraids him with all his dayes worke
impudent fiend stop thy lewd mouth
doest thou not shame and tremble to lay thine owne dull damn’d defects vpon an innocent case there
why thou heauy slaue
the spirit that did possesse that flesh before put more true life in a finger and a thumbe then thou in the whole masse
yet thou rebell’st and murmur’st
what one profer hast thou made wicked inough this day that might be call’d worthy thine owne much lesse the name that sent thee
first thou did’st helpe thy selfe into a beating promptly and with’t endangered’st too thy tongue a diuell and could not keepe a body intire one day
that for our credit
and to vindicate it hinderd’st for ought thou know’st a deed of darknesse which was an act of that egregious folly as no one to’ard the diuel could ha’ thought on
this for your acting
why thou hast beene cheated on with a false beard and a turn’d cloake
faith would your predecessour the cutpurse thinke you ha’ been so
out vpon thee the hurt th’ hast don to let men know their strength and that the’are able to out doe a diuel put in a body will for euer be a scarre vpon our name
whom hast thou dealt with woman or man this day but haue out gone thee some way and most haue prou’d the better fiendes
yet you would be imploy’d

enter the keeper of new gate
here what’s the matter
such an accident falne out at newgate sir a great piece of the prison is rent downe
the diuell has beene there sir in the body of the young cut purse was hang’d out this morning but in new clothes sir euery one of vs know him
these things were found in his pocket
those are mine s^r
i thinke he was commited on your charge sir
for a new felony
hee’s gone sir now and left vs the dead body
but withall sir such an infernall stincke and steame behinde you cannot see s^t
they smell’t as farre as ware as the wind lies by this time sure
is this vpon your credit friend
fitz dottrel leaues counterfaiting
sir you may see and satisfie your selfe
nay then ’tis time to leaue off counterfeiting
sir i am not bewitch’d nor haue a diuell no more then you
i doe defie him i and did abuse you
these two gentlemen put me vpon it
i haue faith against him they taught me all my tricks
i will tell truth and shame the feind
see here sir are my bellowes and my false belly and my mouse and all that should ha’ come forth
sir are not you asham’d now of your solemne serious vanity
i will make honorable amends to truth
and so will but these are coozeners still and ha’ my land as plotters with my wife who though she be not a witch is worse a whore
sir you belie her
she is chaste and vertuous and we are honest
i doe know no glory a man should hope by venting his owne follyes but you’ll still be an asse in spight of prouidence
please you goe in sir and heare truths then iudge ’hem and make amends for your late rashnesse when you shall but heare the paines and care was taken to saue this foole from ruine his grace of drown’d land my land is drown’d indeed peace
and how much his modest and too worthy wife hath suffer’d by mis construction from him you will blush first for your owne beliefe more for his actions
his land is his and neuer by my friend or by my selfe meant to another vse but for her succours who hath equall right
if any other had worse counsells in’t i know i speake to those can apprehend mee let ’hem repent ’hem and be not detected
it is not manly to take ioy or pride in humane errours
wee doe all ill things they doe ’hem worst that loue ’hem and dwell there till the plague comes the few that haue the seeds of goodnesse left will sooner make their way to a true life by shame then punishment
