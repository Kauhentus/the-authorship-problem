now luck yet sends us and a little wit will serve to make our play hit according to the palates of the season here is rhime not empty of reason
this we were bid to credit from our poet whose true scope if you would know it in all his poems still hath been this measure to mix profit with your pleasure and not as some whose throats their envy failing cry hoarsely all he writes is railing and when his plays come forth think they can flout them with saying he was a year about them
to this there needs no lie but this his creature which was two months since no feature and though he dares give them five lives to mend it 'tis known five weeks fully penn'd it from his own hand without a co adjutor novice journey man or tutor
yet thus much i can give you as a token of his play's worth no eggs are broken nor quaking custards with fierce teeth affrighted wherewith your rout are so delighted nor hales he in a gull old ends reciting to stop gaps in his loose writing with such a deal of monstrous and forced action as might make bethlem a faction nor made he his play for jests stolen from each table but makes jests to fit his fable and so presents quick comedy refined as best critics have designed the laws of time place persons he observeth from no needful rule he swerveth
all gall and copperas from his ink he draineth only a little salt remaineth wherewith he'll rub your cheeks till red with laughter they shall look fresh a week after
a good morning to the day and next my gold open the shrine that i may see my saint
hail the world's soul and mine
more glad than is the teeming earth to see the long'd for sun peep through the horns of the celestial ram am i to view thy splendour darkening his that lying here amongst my other hoards shew'st like a flame by night or like the day struck out of chaos when all darkness fled unto the centre
o thou son of sol but brighter than thy father let me kiss with adoration thee and every relick of sacred treasure in this blessed room
well did wise poets by thy glorious name title that age which they would have the best thou being the best of things and far transcending all style of joy in children parents friends or any other waking dream on earth thy looks when they to venus did ascribe they should have given her twenty thousand cupids such are thy beauties and our loves
dear saint riches the dumb god that giv'st all men tongues that canst do nought and yet mak'st men do all things the price of souls even hell with thee to boot is made worth heaven
thou art virtue fame honour and all things else
who can get thee he shall be noble valiant honest wise and what he will sir
riches are in fortune a greater good than wisdom is in nature
true my beloved mosca
yet i glory more in the cunning purchase of my wealth than in the glad possession since i gain no common way i use no trade no venture i wound no earth with plough shares fat no beasts to feed the shambles have no mills for iron oil corn or men to grind them into powder i blow no subtle glass expose no ships to threat'nings of the furrow faced sea i turn no monies in the public bank nor usure private
no sir nor devour soft prodigals
you shall have some will swallow a melting heir as glibly as your dutch will pills of butter and ne'er purge for it tear forth the fathers of poor families out of their beds and coffin them alive in some kind clasping prison where their bones may be forth coming when the flesh is rotten but your sweet nature doth abhor these courses you lothe the widdow's or the orphan's tears should wash your pavements or their piteous cries ring in your roofs and beat the air for vengeance
right mosca i do lothe it
and besides sir you are not like a thresher that doth stand with a huge flail watching a heap of corn and hungry dares not taste the smallest grain but feeds on mallows and such bitter herbs nor like the merchant who hath fill'd his vaults with romagnia and rich candian wines yet drinks the lees of lombard's vinegar you will not lie in straw whilst moths and worms feed on your sumptuous hangings and soft beds you know the use of riches and dare give now from that bright heap to me your poor observer or to your dwarf or your hermaphrodite your eunuch or what other household trifle your pleasure allows maintenance
hold thee mosca take of my hand thou strik'st on truth in all and they are envious term thee parasite
call forth my dwarf my eunuch and my fool and let them make me sport
what should i do but cocker up my genius and live free to all delights my fortune calls me to
i have no wife no parent child ally to give my substance to but whom i make must be my heir and this makes men observe me this draws new clients daily to my house women and men of every sex and age that bring me presents send me plate coin jewels with hope that when i die which they expect each greedy minute it shall then return ten fold upon them whilst some covetous above the rest seek to engross me whole and counter work the one unto the other contend in gifts as they would seem in love all which i suffer playing with their hopes and am content to coin them into profit to look upon their kindness and take more and look on that still bearing them in hand letting the cherry knock against their lips and draw it by their mouths and back again
now room for fresh gamesters who do will you to know they do bring you neither play nor university show and therefore do entreat you that whatsoever they rehearse may not fare a whit the worse for the false pace of the verse
if you wonder at this you will wonder more ere we pass for know here is inclosed the soul of pythagoras that juggler divine as hereafter shall follow which soul fast and loose sir came first from apollo and was breath'd into aethalides mercurius his son where it had the gift to remember all that ever was done
from thence it fled forth and made quick transmigration to goldy lock'd euphorbus who was killed in good fashion at the siege of old troy by the cuckold of sparta
hermotimus was next i find it in my charta to whom it did pass where no sooner it was missing but with one pyrrhus of delos it learn'd to go a fishing and thence did it enter the sophist of greece
from pythagore she went into a beautiful piece hight aspasia the meretrix and the next toss of her was again of a whore she became a philosopher crates the cynick as it self doth relate it since kings knights and beggars knaves lords and fools gat it besides ox and ass camel mule goat and brock in all which it hath spoke as in the cobler's cock
but i come not here to discourse of that matter or his one two or three or his greath oath his musics his trigon his golden thigh or his telling how elements shift but i would ask how of late thou best suffered translation and shifted thy coat in these days of reformation
like one of the reformed a fool as you see counting all old doctrine heresy
but not on thine own forbid meats hast thou ventured
on fish when first a carthusian i enter'd
why then thy dogmatical silence hath left thee
of that an obstreperous lawyer bereft me
o wonderful change when sir lawyer forsook thee
for pythagore's sake what body then took thee
a good dull mule
by that means thou wert brought to allow of the eating of beans
but from the mule into whom didst thou pass
into a very strange beast by some writers call'd an ass by others a precise pure illuminate brother of those devour flesh and sometimes one another and will drop you forth a libel or a sanctified lie betwixt every spoonful of a nativity pie
now quit thee for heaven of that profane nation and gently report thy next transmigration
to the same that i am
a creature of delight and what is more than a fool an hermaphrodite
now prithee sweet soul in all thy variation which body would'st thou choose to keep up thy station
troth this i am in even here would i tarry
'cause here the delight of each sex thou canst vary
alas those pleasures be stale and forsaken no 'tis your fool wherewith i am so taken the only one creature that i can call blessed for all other forms i have proved most distressed
spoke true as thou wert in pythagoras still
this learned opinion we celebrate will fellow eunuch as behoves us with all our wit and art to dignify that whereof ourselves are so great and special a part
now very very pretty
mosca this was thy invention
if it please my patron not else
it doth good mosca
then it was sir
fools they are the only nation worth men's envy or admiration free from care or sorrow taking selves and others merry making all they speak or do is sterling
your fool he is your great man's darling and your ladies' sport and pleasure tongue and bauble are his treasure
e'en his face begetteth laughter and he speaks truth free from slaughter he's the grace of every feast and sometimes the chiefest guest hath his trencher and his stool when wit waits upon the fool o who would not be he he he
'tis signior voltore the advocate i know him by his knock
fetch me my gown my furs and night caps say my couch is changing and let him entertain himself awhile without i' the gallery
now now my clients begin their visitation
vulture kite raven and gorcrow all my birds of prey that think me turning carcase now they come i am not for them yet how now
a piece of plate sir
huge massy and antique with your name inscribed and arms engraven
and not a fox stretch'd on the earth with fine delusive sleights mocking a gaping crow
give me my furs
why dost thou laugh so man
i cannot choose sir when i apprehend what thoughts he has without now as he walks that this might be the last gift he should give that this would fetch you if you died to day and gave him all what he should be to morrow what large return would come of all his ventures how he should worship'd be and reverenced ride with his furs and foot cloths waited on by herds of fools and clients have clear way made for his mule as letter'd as himself be call'd the great and learned advocate and then concludes there's nought impossible
yes to be learned mosca
o no rich implies it
hood an ass with reverend purple so you can hide his two ambitious ears and he shall pass for a cathedral doctor
my caps my caps good mosca
stay sir your ointment for your eyes
that's true dispatch dispatch i long to have possession of my new present
that and thousands more i hope to see you lord of
and that when i am lost in blended dust and hundred such as i am in succession nay that were too much mosca
you shall live still to delude these harpies
'tis well my pillow now and let him enter
now my fain'd cough my pthisic and my gout my apoplexy palsy and catarrhs help with your forced functions this my posture wherein this three year i have milk'd their hopes
he comes i hear him uh
o a you still are what you were sir
only you of all the rest are he commands his love and you do wisely to preserve it thus with early visitation and kind notes of your good meaning to him which i know cannot but come most grateful
here's signior voltore is come what say you
sir signior voltore is come this morning to visit you
and hath brought a piece of antique plate bought of st mark with which he here presents you
pray him to come more often
he thanks you and desires you see him often
bring him near where is he
i long to feel his hand
the plate is here sir
how fare you sir
i thank you signior voltore where is the plate
mine eyes are bad
i'm sorry to see you still thus weak
that he's not weaker
you are too munificent
no sir would to heaven i could as well give health to you as that plate
you give sir what you can i thank you
your love hath taste in this and shall not be unanswer'd i pray you see me often
yes i shall sir
be not far from me
do you observe that sir
hearken unto me still it will concern you
you are a happy man sir know your good
i cannot now last long you are his heir sir
am i feel me going uh
i'm sailing to my port uh
and i am glad i am so near my haven
well we must all go but mosca age will conquer
'pray thee hear me am i inscribed his heir for certain
i do beseech you sir you will vouchsafe to write me in your family
all my hopes depend upon your worship i am lost except the rising sun do shine on me
it shall both shine and warm thee mosca
sir i am a man that hath not done your love all the worst offices here i wear your keys see all your coffers and your caskets lock'd keep the poor inventory of your jewels your plate and monies am your steward sir
husband your goods here
but am i sole heir
without a partner sir confirm'd this morning the wax is warm yet and the ink scarce dry upon the parchment
by what good chance sweet mosca
your desert sir i know no second cause
thy modesty is not to know it well we shall requite it
he ever liked your course sir that first took him
i oft have heard him say how he admired men of your large profession that could speak to every cause and things mere contraries till they were hoarse again yet all be law that with most quick agility could turn and re return could make knots and undo them give forked counsel take provoking gold on either hand and put it up these men he knew would thrive with their humility
and for his part he thought he should be blest to have his heir of such a suffering spirit so wise so grave of so perplex'd a tongue and loud withal that would not wag nor scarce lie still without a fee when every word your worship but lets fall is a chequin
one knocks i would not have you seen sir
and yet pretend you came and went in haste i'll fashion an excuse
and gentle sir when you do come to swim in golden lard up to the arms in honey that your chin is born up stiff with fatness of the flood think on your vassal but remember me i have not been your worst of clients
when will you have your inventory brought sir
or see a coppy of the will
i will bring them to you sir
away be gone put business in your face
come hither let me kiss thee
keep you still sir
set the plate away the vulture's gone and the old raven's come
betake you to your silence and your sleep stand there and multiply
now shall we see a wretch who is indeed more impotent than this can feign to be yet hopes to hop over his grave
you're very welcome sir
how does your patron
troth as he did sir no amends
no sir he's rather worse
upon his couch sir newly fall'n asleep
does he sleep well
no wink sir all this night
nor yesterday but slumbers
he should take some counsel of physicians i have brought him an opiate here from mine own doctor
he will not hear of drugs
i myself stood by while it was made saw all the ingredients and know it cannot but most gently work my life for his 'tis but to make him sleep
ay his last sleep if he would take it
sir he has no faith in physic
he has no faith in physic he does think most of your doctors are the greater danger and worse disease to escape
i often have heard him protest that your physician should never be his heir
not i his heir
not your physician sir
o no no no i do not mean it
no sir nor their fees he cannot brook he says they flay a man before they kill him
right i do conceive you
and then they do it by experiment for which the law not only doth absolve them but gives them great reward and he is loth to hire his death so
it is true they kill with as much license as a judge
nay more for he but kills sir where the law condemns and these can kill him too
ay or me or any man
how does his apoplex
is that strong on him still
his speech is broken and his eyes are set his face drawn longer than 'twas wont how
stronger then he was wont
no sir his face drawn longer than 'twas wont
his mouth is ever gaping and his eyelids hang
a freezing numbness stiffens all his joints and makes the colour of his flesh like lead
his pulse beats slow and dull
and from his brain i conceive you good
flows a cold sweat with a continual rheum forth the resolved corners of his eyes
yet i am better ha
how does he with the swimming of his head
b o sir 'tis past the scotomy he now hath lost his feeling and hath left to snort you hardly can perceive him that he breathes
sure i shall outlast him this makes me young again a score of years
i was a coming for you sir
has he made his will
what has he given me
he has not made his will sir
but what did voltore the lawyer here
he smelt a carcase sir when he but heard my master was about his testament as i did urge him to it for your good he came unto him did he
yes and presented him this piece of plate
to be his heir
i do not know sir
true i know it too
by your own scale sir
well i shall prevent him yet
see mosca look here i have brought a bag of bright chequines will quite weigh down his plate
this is true physic this your sacred medicine no talk of opiates to this great elixir
'tis aurum palpabile if not potabile
it shall be minister'd to him in his bowl
ay do do do
this will recover him
yes do do do
i think it were not best sir
o no no no by no means
why sir this will work some strange effect if he but feel it
'tis true therefore forbear i'll take my venture give me it again
at no hand pardon me you shall not do yourself that wrong sir
i will so advise you you shall have it all
all sir 'tis your right your own no man can claim a part 'tis yours without a rival decreed by destiny
how how good mosca
i'll tell you sir
this fit he shall recover
i do conceive you
and on first advantage of his gain'd sense will i re importune him unto the making of his testament and shew him this
'tis better yet if you will hear sir
yes with all my heart
now would i counsel you make home with speed there frame a will whereto you shall inscribe my master your sole heir
and disinherit my son
o sir the better for that colour shall make it much more taking
this will sir you shall send it unto me
now when i come to inforce as i will do your cares your watchings and your many prayers your more than many gifts your this day's present and last produce your will where without thought or least regard unto your proper issue a son so brave and highly meriting the stream of your diverted love hath thrown you upon my master and made him your heir he cannot be so stupid or stone dead but out of conscience and mere gratitude he must pronounce me his
this plot did i think on before
i do believe it
do you not believe it
which when he hath done sir
publish'd me his heir
and you so certain to survive him ay
being so lusty a man 'tis true
yes sir i thought on that too
see how he should be the very organ to express my thoughts
you have not only done yourself a good but multiplied it on my son
heaven knows it hath been all my study all my care i e'en grow gray withal how to work things i do conceive sweet mosca
you are he for whom i labour here
ay do do do i'll straight about it
rook go with you raven
i know thee honest
you do lie sir
and your knowledge is no better than your ears sir
i do not doubt to be a father to thee
nor i to gull my brother of his blessing
i may have my youth restored to me why not
your worship is a precious ass
i do desire your worship to make haste sir
'tis done 'tis done i go
o i shall burst
let out my sides let out my sides contain your flux of laughter sir you know this hope is such a bait it covers any hook
o but thy working and thy placing it
i cannot hold good rascal let me kiss thee i never knew thee in so rare a humour
alas sir i but do as i am taught follow your grave instructions give them words pour oil into their ears and send them hence
'tis true 'tis true
what a rare punishment is avarice to itself
ay with our help sir
so many cares so many maladies so many fears attending on old age yea death so often call'd on as no wish can be more frequent with them their limbs faint their senses dull their seeing hearing going all dead before them yea their very teeth their instruments of eating failing them yet this is reckon'd life
nay here was one is now gone home that wishes to live longer
feels not his gout nor palsy feigns himself younger by scores of years flatters his age with confident belying it hopes he may with charms like aeson have his youth restored and with these thoughts so battens as if fate would be as easily cheated on as he and all turns air
who's that there now
close to your couch again i hear his voice it is corvino our spruce merchant
another bout sir with your eyes
come most wish'd for
o how happy were you if you knew it now
the tardy hour is come sir
he is not dead
not dead sir but as good he knows no man
how shall i do then
i have brought him here a pearl
perhaps he has so much remembrance left as to know you sir he still calls on you nothing but your name is in his mouth is your pearl orient sir
venice was never owner of the like
he calls you step and give it him
he's here sir and he has brought you a rich pearl
how do you sir
tell him it doubles the twelfth caract
sir he cannot understand his hearing's gone and yet it comforts him to see you say i have a diamond for him too
best shew it sir put it into his hand 'tis only there he apprehends he has his feeling yet
see how he grasps it
how pitiful the sight is
the weeping of an heir should still be laughter under a visor
why am i his heir
sir i am sworn i may not shew the will till he be dead but here has been corbaccio here has been voltore here were others too i cannot number 'em they were so many all gaping here for legacies but i taking the vantage of his naming you "signior corvino signior corvino" took paper and pen and ink and there i asked him whom he would have his heir
" who should be executor
" and to any question he was silent too i still interpreted the nods he made through weakness for consent and sent home th' others nothing bequeath'd them but to cry and curse
o my dear mosca
does he not perceive us
no more than a blind harper
he knows no man no face of friend nor name of any servant who 'twas that fed him last or gave him drink not those he hath begotten or brought up can he remember
bastards some dozen or more that he begot on beggars gipsies and jews and black moors when he was drunk
knew you not that sir
'tis the common fable
the dwarf the fool the eunuch are all his he's the true father of his family in all save me but he has giv'n them nothing
that's well that's well
art sure he does not hear us
why look you credit your own sense
the pox approach and add to your diseases if it would send you hence the sooner sir for your incontinence it hath deserv'd it thoroughly and thoroughly and the plague to boot
you may come near sir
would you would once close those filthy eyes of yours that flow with slime like two frog pits and those same hanging cheeks cover'd with hide instead of skin nay help sir that look like frozen dish clouts set on end
or like an old smoked wall on which the rain ran down in streaks
sir speak out you may be louder yet a culverin discharged in his ear would hardly bore it
his nose is like a common sewer still running
and what his mouth
o stop it up by no means
'pray you let me
faith i could stifle him rarely with a pillow as well as any woman that should keep him
do as you will but i'll begone
be so it is your presence makes him last so long
i pray you use no violence
why should you be thus scrupulous pray you sir
nay at your discretion
well good sir begone
i will not trouble him now to take my pearl
what a needless care is this afflicts you
is not all here yours
am not i here whom you have made your creature
that owe my being to you
thou art my friend my fellow my companion my partner and shalt share in all my fortunes
your gallant wife sir now is he gone we had no other means to shoot him hence but this
thou hast to day outgone thyself
i will be troubled with no more
prepare me music dances banquets all delights the turk is not more sensual in his pleasures than will volpone
let me see a pearl
good morning's purchase why this is better than rob churches yet or fat by eating once a month a man
the beauteous lady would be sir
wife to the english knight sir politick would be this is the style sir is directed me hath sent to know how you have slept to night and if you would be visited
not now some three hours hence i told the squire so much
when i am high with mirth and wine then then 'fore heaven i wonder at the desperate valour of the bold english that they dare let loose their wives to all encounters
sir this knight had not his name for nothing he is politick and knows howe'er his wife affect strange airs she hath not yet the face to be dishonest but had she signior corvino's wife's face has she so rare a face
o sir the wonder the blazing star of italy
a wench of the first year
a beauty ripe as harvest
whose skin is whiter than a swan all over than silver snow or lilies
a soft lip would tempt you to eternity of kissing
and flesh that melteth in the touch to blood
bright as your gold and lovely as your gold
why had not i known this before
alas sir myself but yesterday discover'd it
how might i see her
o not possible she's kept as warily as is your gold never does come abroad never takes air but at a window
all her looks are sweet as the first grapes or cherries and are watch'd as near as they are
i must see her
sir there is a guard of spies ten thick upon her all his whole household each of which is set upon his fellow and have all their charge when he goes out when he comes in examined
i will go see her though but at her window
in some disguise then
that is true i must maintain mine own shape still the same we'll think
a p sir to a wise man all the world's his soil it is not italy nor france nor europe that must bound me if my fates call me forth
yet i protest it is no salt desire of seeing countries shifting a religion nor any disaffection to the state where i was bred and unto which i owe my dearest plots hath brought me out much less that idle antique stale gray headed project of knowing men's minds and manners with ulysses
but a peculiar humour of my wife's laid for this height of venice to observe to quote to learn the language and so forth i hope you travel sir with license
p i dare the safelier converse how long sir since you left england
you have not been with my lord ambassador
p pray you what news sir vents our climate
i heard last night a most strange thing reported by some of my lord's followers and i long to hear how 'twill be seconded
p marry sir of a raven that should build in a ship royal of the king's
this fellow does he gull me trow
p my name is politick would be
o that speaks him
p a poor knight sir
your lady lies here in venice for intelligence of tires and fashions and behaviour among the courtezans
the fine lady would be
p yes sir the spider and the bee ofttimes suck from one flower
good sir politick i cry you mercy i have heard much of you 'tis true sir of your raven
p on your knowledge
yes and your lion's whelping in the tower
what prodigies be these
the fires at berwick
and the new star
these things concurring strange and full of omen
saw you those meteors
pray you sir confirm me were there three porpoises seen above the bridge as they give out
six and a sturgeon sir
p i am astonish'd
nay sir be not so i'll tell you a greater prodigy than these
p what should these things portend
the very day let me be sure that i put forth from london there was a whale discover'd in the river as high as woolwich that had waited there few know how many months for the subversion of the stode fleet
believe it 'twas either sent from spain or the archdukes spinola's whale upon my life my credit
will they not leave these projects
worthy sir some other news
faith stone the fool is dead and they do lack a tavern fool extremely
p is mass stone dead
he's dead sir why i hope you thought him not immortal
o this knight were he well known would be a precious thing to fit our english stage he that should write but such a fellow should be thought to feign extremely if not maliciously
how deeply sir you apprehend it
he was no kinsman to you
p that i know of
that same fellow was an unknown fool
and yet you knew him it seems
p i did so
sir i knew him one of the most dangerous heads living within the state and so i held him
p while he lived in action
he has received weekly intelligence upon my knowledge out of the low countries for all parts of the world in cabbages and those dispensed again to ambassadors in oranges musk melons apricocks lemons pome citrons and such like sometimes in colchester oysters and your selsey cockles
you make me wonder
p sir upon my knowledge
nay i've observed him at your public ordinary take his advertisement from a traveller a conceal'd statesman in a trencher of meat and instantly before the meal was done convey an answer in a tooth pick
how could this be sir
p why the meat was cut so like his character and so laid as he must easily read the cipher
i have heard he could not read sir
p so 'twas given out in policy by those that did employ him but he could read and had your languages and to't as sound a noddle i have heard sir that your baboons were spies and that they were a kind of subtle nation near to china p ay ay your mamuluchi
faith they had their hand in a french plot or two but they were so extremely given to women as they made discovery of all yet i had my advices here on wednesday last
from one of their own coat they were return'd made their relations as the fashion is and now stand fair for fresh employment
this sir pol will be ignorant of nothing
it seems sir you know all
p not all sir but i have some general notions
i do love to note and to observe though i live out free from the active torrent yet i'd mark the currents and the passages of things for mine own private use and know the ebbs and flows of state
believe it sir i hold myself in no small tie unto my fortunes for casting me thus luckily upon you whose knowledge if your bounty equal it may do me great assistance in instruction for my behaviour and my bearing which is yet so rude and raw
p why came you forth empty of rules for travel
faith i had some common ones from out that vulgar grammar which he that cried italian to me taught me
p why this it is that spoils all our brave bloods trusting our hopeful gentry unto pedants fellows of outside and mere bark
you seem to be a gentleman of ingenuous race i not profess it but my fate hath been to be where i have been consulted with in this high kind touching some great men's sons persons of blood and honour
a who be these sir
under that window there 't must be
p fellows to mount a bank
did your instructor in the dear tongues never discourse to you of the italian mountebanks
p why here shall you see one
they are quacksalvers fellows that live by venting oils and drugs
p was that the character he gave you of them
p pity his ignorance
they are the only knowing men of europe
great general scholars excellent physicians most admired statesmen profest favourites and cabinet counsellors to the greatest princes the only languaged men of all the world
and i have heard they are most lewd impostors made all of terms and shreds no less beliers of great men's favours than their own vile med'cines which they will utter upon monstrous oaths selling that drug for two pence ere they part which they have valued at twelve crowns before
p sir calumnies are answer'd best with silence
who is it mounts my friends
scoto of mantua sir
nay then i'll proudly promise sir you shall behold another man than has been phant'sied to you
i wonder yet that he should mount his bank here in this nook that has been wont t'appear in face of the piazza
a a mount zany
follow follow follow follow
p see how the people follow him
he's a man may write ten thousand crowns in bank here
note mark but his gesture i do use to observe the state he keeps in getting up
'tis worth it sir
most noble gentlemen and my worthy patrons
it may seem strange that i your scoto mantuano who was ever wont to fix my bank in face of the public piazza near the shelter of the portico to the procuratia should now after eight months' absence from this illustrious city of venice humbly retire myself into an obscure nook of the piazza
p did not i now object the same
let me tell you i am not as your lombard proverb saith cold on my feet or content to part with my commodities at a cheaper rate than i accustomed look not for it
nor that the calumnious reports of that impudent detractor and shame to our profession alessandro buttone i mean who gave out in public i was condemn'd a sforzato to the galleys for poisoning the cardinal bembo's cook hath at all attached much less dejected me
no no worthy gentlemen to tell you true i cannot endure to see the rabble of these ground ciarlitani that spread their cloaks on the pavement as if they meant to do feats of activity and then come in lamely with their mouldy tales out of boccacio like stale tabarine the fabulist some of them discoursing their travels and of their tedious captivity in the turks' galleys when indeed were the truth known they were the christians' galleys where very temperately they eat bread and drunk water as a wholesome penance enjoined them by their confessors for base pilferies
p note but his bearing and contempt of these
these turdy facy nasty paty lousy fartical rogues with one poor groat's worth of unprepared antimony finely wrapt up in several scartoccios are able very well to kill their twenty a week and play yet these meagre starved spirits who have half stopt the organs of their minds with earthy oppilations want not their favourers among your shrivell'd sallad eating artizans who are overjoyed that they may have their half pe'rth of physic though it purge them into another world it makes no matter
have you heard better language sir
well let them go
and gentlemen honourable gentlemen know that for this time our bank being thus removed from the clamours of the canaglia shall be the scene of pleasure and delight for i have nothing to sell little or nothing to sell
p i told you sir his end
you did so sir
i protest i and my six servants are not able to make of this precious liquor so fast as it is fetch'd away from my lodging by gentlemen of your city strangers of the terra firma worshipful merchants ay and senators too who ever since my arrival have detained me to their uses by their splendidous liberalities
and worthily for what avails your rich man to have his magazines stuft with moscadelli or of the purest grape when his physicians prescribe him on pain of death to drink nothing but water cocted with aniseeds
the blessing of the rich the riches of the poor
who can buy thee at too dear a rate since there is no enjoying this world without thee
be not then so sparing of your purses honourable gentlemen as to abridge the natural course of life you see his end
p ay is't not good
for when a humid flux or catarrh by the mutability of air falls from your head into an arm or shoulder or any other part take you a ducat or your chequin of gold and apply to the place affected see what good effect it can work
no no 'tis this blessed unguento this rare extraction that hath only power to disperse all malignant humours that proceed either of hot cold moist or windy causes i would he had put in dry too
p 'pray you observe
to fortify the most indigest and crude stomach ay were it of one that through extreme weakness vomited blood applying only a warm napkin to the place after the unction and fricace for the vertigine in the head putting but a drop into your nostrils likewise behind the ears a most sovereign and approved remedy
the mal caduco cramps convulsions paralysies epilepsies tremor cordia retired nerves ill vapours of the spleen stopping of the liver the stone the strangury hernia ventosa iliaca passio stops a disenteria immediately easeth the torsion of the small guts and cures melancholia hypocondriaca being taken and applied according to my printed receipt
for this is the physician this the medicine this counsels this cures this gives the direction this works the effect and in sum both together may be termed an abstract of the theorick and practick in the aesculapian art
'twill cost you eight crowns
and zan fritada prithee sing a verse extempore in honour of it
p how do you like him sir
most strangely p is not his language rare
but alchemy i never heard the like or broughton's books
had old hippocrates or galen that to their books put med'cines all in but known this secret they had never of which they will be guilty ever been murderers of so much paper or wasted many a hurtless taper no indian drug had e'er been famed tabacco sassafras not named ne yet of guacum one small stick sir nor raymund lully's great elixir
ne had been known the danish gonswart or paracelsus with his long sword
all this yet will not do eight crowns is high
gentlemen if i had but time to discourse to you the miraculous effects of this my oil surnamed oglio del scoto with the countless catalogue of those i have cured of the aforesaid and many more diseases the pattents and privileges of all the princes and commonwealths of christendom or but the depositions of those that appeared on my part before the signiory of the sanita and most learned college of physicians where i was authorised upon notice taken of the admirable virtues of my medicaments and mine own excellency in matter of rare and unknown secrets not only to disperse them publicly in this famous city but in all the territories that happily joy under the government of the most pious and magnificent states of italy
but may some other gallant fellow say o there be divers that make profession to have as good and as experimented receipts as yours indeed very many have assayed like apes in imitation of that which is really and essentially in me to make of this oil bestowed great cost in furnaces stills alembecks continual fires and preparation of the ingredients as indeed there goes to it six hundred several simples besides some quantity of human fat for the conglutination which we buy of the anatomists but when these practitioners come to the last decoction blow blow puff puff and all flies in fumo ha ha ha
i rather pity their folly and indiscretion than their loss of time and money for these may be recovered by industry but to be a fool born is a disease incurable
for myself i always from my youth have endeavoured to get the rarest secrets and book them either in exchange or for money i spared nor cost nor labour where any thing was worthy to be learned
and gentlemen honourable gentlemen i will undertake by virtue of chemical art out of the honourable hat that covers your head to extract the four elements that is to say the fire air water and earth and return you your felt without burn or stain
for whilst others have been at the balloo i have been at my book and am now past the craggy paths of study and come to the flowery plains of honour and reputation
p i do assure you sir that is his aim
but to our price and that withal sir pol
you all know honourable gentlemen i never valued this ampulla or vial at less than eight crowns but for this time i am content to be deprived of it for six six crowns is the price and less in courtesy i know you cannot offer me take it or leave it howsoever both it and i am at your service
i ask you not as the value of the thing for then i should demand of you a thousand crowns so the cardinals montalto fernese the great duke of tuscany my gossip with divers other princes have given me but i despise money
only to shew my affection to you honourable gentlemen and your illustrious state here i have neglected the messages of these princes mine own offices framed my journey hither only to present you with the fruits of my travels
tune your voices once more to the touch of your instruments and give the honourable assembly some delightful recreation
what monstrous and most painful circumstance is here to get some three or four gazettes some three pence in the whole
for that 'twill come to
you that would last long list to my song make no more coil but buy of this oil
would you be ever fair and young
stout of teeth and strong of tongue
and light of foot
or i will come nearer to't would you live free from all diseases
do the act your mistress pleases yet fright all aches from your bones
here's a med'cine for the nones
well i am in a humour at this time to make a present of the small quantity my coffer contains to the rich in courtesy and to the poor for god's sake
wherefore now mark i ask'd you six crowns and six crowns at other times you have paid me you shall not give me six crowns nor five nor four nor three nor two nor one nor half a ducat no nor a moccinigo
sixpence it will cost you or six hundred pound expect no lower price for by the banner of my front i will not bate a bagatine that i will have only a pledge of your loves to carry something from amongst you to shew i am not contemn'd by you
therefore now toss your handkerchiefs cheerfully cheerfully and be advertised that the first heroic spirit that deignes to grace me with a handkerchief i will give it a little remembrance of something beside shall please it better than if i had presented it with a double pistolet
will you be that heroic spark sir pol
the window has prevented you
lady i kiss your bounty and for this timely grace you have done your poor scoto of mantua i will return you over and above my oil a secret of that high and inestimable nature shall make you for ever enamour'd on that minute wherein your eye first descended on so mean yet not altogether to be despised an object
here is a powder conceal'd in this paper of which if i should speak to the worth nine thousand volumes were but as one page that page as a line that line as a word so short is this pilgrimage of man which some call life to the expressing of it
would i reflect on the price
why the whole world is but as an empire that empire as a province that province as a bank that bank as a private purse to the purchase of it
i will only tell you it is the powder that made venus a goddess given her by apollo that kept her perpetually young clear'd her wrinkles firm'd her gums fill'd her skin colour'd her hair from her deriv'd to helen and at the sack of troy unfortunately lost till now in this our age it was as happily recovered by a studious antiquary out of some ruins of asia who sent a moiety of it to the court of france but much sophisticated wherewith the ladies there now colour their hair
the rest at this present remains with me extracted to a quintessence so that whereever it but touches in youth it perpetually preserves in age restores the complexion seats your teeth did they dance like virginal jacks firm as a wall makes them white as ivory that were black as spight o' the devil and my shame
come down here come down no house but mine to make your scene
signior flaminio will you down sir
what is my wife your franciscina sir
no windows on the whole piazza here to make your properties but mine
ere to morrow i shall be new christen'd and call'd the pantalone di besogniosi about the town
what should this mean sir pol
p some trick of state believe it
it may be some design on you p i know not
i'll stand upon my guard
it is your best sir
p this three weeks all my advices all my letters they have been intercepted
best have a care
p nay so i will
this knight i may not lose him for my mirth till night
a o i am wounded
not without those blows were nothing i could bear them ever
but angry cupid bolting from her eyes hath shot himself into me like a flame where now he flings about his burning heat as in a furnace an ambitious fire whose vent is stopt
the fight is all within me
i cannot live except thou help me mosca my liver melts and i without the hope of some soft air from her refreshing breath am but a heap of cinders
'las good sir would you had never seen her
nay would thou had'st never told me of her
sir 'tis true i do confess i was unfortunate and you unhappy but i'm bound in conscience no less than duty to effect my best to your release of torment and i will sir
dear mosca shall i hope
sir more than dear i will not bid you to dispair of aught within a human compass
o there spoke my better angel
mosca take my keys gold plate and jewels all's at thy devotion employ them how thou wilt nay coin me too so thou in this but crown my longings mosca
use but your patience
i doubt not to bring success to your desires
nay then i not repent me of my late disguise
if you can horn him sir you need not
true besides i never meant him for my heir
is not the colour of my beard and eyebrows to make me known
i did it well
so well would i could follow you in mine with half the happiness
and yet i would escape your epilogue
but were they gull'd with a belief that i was scoto
sir scoto himself could hardly have distinguish'd
i have not time to flatter you now we'll part and as i prosper so applaud my art
a death of mine honour with the city's fool
a juggling tooth drawing prating mountebank
and at a public window
where whilst he with his strain'd action and his dole of faces to his drug lecture draws your itching ears a crew of old unmarried noted letchers stood leering up like satyrs and you smile most graciously and fan your favours forth to give your hot spectators satisfaction
what was your mountebank their call
or were you enamour'd on his copper rings his saffron jewel with the toad stone in't or his embroider'd suit with the cope stitch made of a herse cloth
or his old tilt feather
or his starch'd beard
well you shall have him yes
he shall come home and minister unto you the fricace for the mother
or let me see i think you'd rather mount would you not mount
why if you'll mount you may yes truly you may and so you may be seen down to the foot
get you a cittern lady vanity and be a dealer with the virtuous man make one i'll but protest myself a cuckold and save your dowry
i'm a dutchman for if you thought me an italian you would be damn'd ere you did this you whore
thou'dst tremble to imagine that the murder of father mother brother all thy race should follow as the subject of my justice
good sir have pacience
what couldst thou propose less to thyself than in this heat of wrath and stung with my dishonour i should strike this steel into thee with as many stabs as thou wert gaz'd upon with goatish eyes
alas sir be appeas'd
i could not think my being at the window should more now move your impatience than at other times
not to seek and entertain a parley with a known knave before a multitude
you were an actor with your handkerchief which he most sweetly kist in the receipt and might no doubt return it with a letter and point the place where you might meet your sister's your mother's or your aunt's might serve the turn
why dear sir when do i make these excuses or ever stir abroad but to the church
and that so seldom well it shall be less and thy restraint before was liberty to what i now decree and therefore mark me
first i will have this bawdy light damm'd up and till't be done some two or three yards off i'll chalk a line o'er which if thou but chance to set thy desperate foot more hell more horror more wild remorseless rage shall seize on thee than on a conjurer that had heedless left his circle's safety ere his devil was laid
then here's a lock which i will hang upon thee and now i think on't i will keep thee backwards thy lodging shall be backwards thy walks backwards thy prospect all be backwards and no pleasure that thou shalt know but backwards nay since you force my honest nature know it is your own being too open makes me use you thus since you will not contain your subtle nostrils in a sweet room but they must snuff the air of rank and sweaty passengers
away and be not seen pain of thy life nor look toward the window if thou dost nay stay hear this let me not prosper whore but i will make thee an anatomy dissect thee mine own self and read a lecture upon thee to the city and in public
'tis signior mosca sir
let him come in
his master's dead there's yet some good to help the bad
i guess your news
i fear you cannot sir
is't not his death
yes sir i am curs'd i am bewitch'd my crosses meet to vex me
why sir with scoto's oil corbaccio and voltore brought of it whilst i was busy in an inner room death
that damn'd mountebank but for the law now i could kill the rascal it cannot be his oil should have that virtue
have not i known him a common rogue come fidling in to the osteria with a tumbling whore and when he has done all his forced tricks been glad of a poor spoonful of dead wine with flies in't
all his ingredients are a sheep's gall a roasted bitch's marrow some few sod earwigs pounded caterpillars a little capon's grease and fasting spittle i know them to a dram
i know not sir but some on't there they pour'd into his ears some in his nostrils and recover'd him applying but the fricace
pox o' that fricace
and since to seem the more officious and flatt'ring of his health there they have had at extreme fees the college of physicians consulting on him how they might restore him where one would have a cataplasm of spices another a flay'd ape clapp'd to his breast a third would have it a dog a fourth an oil with wild cats' skins at last they all resolved that to preserve him was no other means but some young woman must be straight sought out lusty and full of juice to sleep by him and to this service most unhappily and most unwillingly am i now employ'd which here i thought to pre acquaint you with for your advice since it concerns you most because i would not do that thing might cross your ends on whom i have my whole dependance sir yet if i do it not they may delate my slackness to my patron work me out of his opinion and there all your hopes ventures or whatsoever are all frustrate
i do but tell you sir
besides they are all now striving who shall first present him therefore i could entreat you briefly conclude somewhat prevent them if you can
death to my hopes this is my villainous fortune
best to hire some common courtezan
ay i thought on that sir but they are all so subtle full of art and age again doting and flexible so as i cannot tell we may perchance light on a quean may cheat us all
no no it must be one that has no tricks sir some simple thing a creature made unto it some wench you may command
have you no kinswoman
odso think think think think think think think sir
one o' the doctors offer'd there his daughter
yes signior lupo the physician
and a virgin sir
alas he knows the state of's body what it is that nought can warm his blood sir but a fever nor any incantation raise his spirit a long forgetfulness hath seized that part
besides sir who shall know it
some one or two i prithee give me leave
if any man but i had had this luck the thing in't self i know is nothing wherefore should not i as well command my blood and my affections as this dull doctor
in the point of honour the cases are all one of wife and daughter
i hear him coming
she shall do't 'tis done
if this doctor who is not engaged unless 't be for his counsel which is nothing offer his daughter what should i that am so deeply in
i will prevent him wretch
mosca i have determined
we'll make all sure
the party you wot of shall be mine own wife mosca
sir the thing but that i would not seem to counsel you i should have motion'd to you at the first and make your count you have cut all their throats
'tis directly taking a possession
and in his next fit we may let him go
'tis but to pull the pillow from his head and he is throttled it had been done before but for your scrupulous doubts
ay a plague on't my conscience fools my wit
well i'll be brief and so be thou lest they should be before us go home prepare him tell him with what zeal and willingness i do it swear it was on the first hearing as thou mayst do truly mine own free motion
sir i warrant you i'll so possess him with it that the rest of his starv'd clients shall be banish'd all and only you received
but come not sir until i send for i have something else to ripen for your good you must not know't
but do not you forget to send now
where are you wife
come dry those tears
i think thou thought'st me in earnest ha
by this light i talk'd so but to try thee methinks the lightness of the occasion should have confirm'd thee
come i am not jealous
faith i am not i nor never was it is a poor unprofitable humour
do not i know if women have a will they'll do 'gainst all the watches of the world and that the feircest spies are tamed with gold
tut i am confident in thee thou shalt see't and see i'll give thee cause too to believe it
go and make thee ready straight in all thy best attire thy choicest jewels put them all on and with them thy best looks we are invited to a solemn feast at old volpone's where it shall appear how far i am free from jealousy or fear
a i fear i shall begin to grow in love with my dear self and my most prosperous parts they do so spring and burgeon i can feel a whimsy in my blood i know not how success hath made me wanton
i could skip out of my skin now like a subtle snake i am so limber
your parasite is a most precious thing dropt from above not bred 'mongst clods and clodpoles here on earth
i muse the mystery was not made a science it is so liberally profest
almost all the wise world is little else in nature but parasites or sub parasites
and yet i mean not those that have your bare town art to know who's fit to feed them have no house no family no care and therefore mould tales for men's ears to bait that sense or get kitchen invention and some stale receipts to please the belly and the groin nor those with their court dog tricks that can fawn and fleer make their revenue out of legs and faces echo my lord and lick away a moth but your fine elegant rascal that can rise and stoop almost together like an arrow shoot through the air as nimbly as a star turn short as doth a swallow and be here and there and here and yonder all at once present to any humour all occasion and change a visor swifter than a thought
this is the creature had the art born with him toils not to learn it but doth practise it out of most excellent nature and such sparks are the true parasites others but their zanis
bonario old corbaccio's son
the person i was bound to seek
fair sir you are happily met
that cannot be by thee
nay pray thee know thy way and leave me i would be loth to interchange discourse with such a mate as thou art courteous sir scorn not my poverty
not i by heaven but thou shalt give me leave to hate thy baseness
ay answer me is not thy sloth sufficient argument
thy means of feeding
heaven be good to me
these imputations are too common sir and easily stuck on virtue when she's poor
you are unequal to me and however your sentence may be righteous yet you are not that ere you know me thus proceed in censure st
mark bear witness 'gainst you 'tis inhuman
the sign is soft and good i do repent me that i was so harsh
'tis true that sway'd by strong necessity i am enforced to eat my careful bread with too much obsequy 'tis true beside that i am fain to spin mine own poor raiment out of my mere observance being not born to a free fortune but that i have done base offices in rending friends asunder dividing families betraying counsels whispering false lies or mining men with praises train'd their credulity with perjuries corrupted chastity or am in love with mine own tender ease but would not rather prove the most rugged and laborious course that might redeem my present estimation let me here perish in all hope of goodness
this cannot be a personated passion
i was to blame so to mistake thy nature prithee forgive me and speak out thy business
sir it concerns you and though i may seem at first to make a main offence in manners and in my gratitude unto my master yet for the pure love which i bear all right and hatred of the wrong i must reveal it
this very hour your father is in purpose to disinherit you how
and thrust you forth as a mere stranger to his blood 'tis true sir the work no way engageth me but as i claim an interest in the general state of goodness and true virtue which i hear to abound in you and for which mere respect without a second aim sir i have done it
this tale hath lost thee much of the late trust thou hadst with me it is impossible i know not how to lend it any thought my father should be so unnatural
it is a confidence that well becomes your piety and form'd no doubt it is from your own simple innocence which makes your wrong more monstrous and abhorr'd
but sir i now will tell you more
this very minute it is or will be doing and if you shall be but pleas'd to go with me i'll bring you i dare not say where you shall see but where your ear shall be a witness of the deed hear yourself written bastard and profest the common issue of the earth
sir if i do it not draw your just sword and score your vengeance on my front and face mark me your villain you have too much wrong and i do suffer for you sir
my heart weeps blood in anguish lead i follow thee
a mosca stays long methinks
bring forth your sports and help to make the wretched time more sweet
dwarf fool and eunuch well met here we be
a question it were now whether of us three being all the known delicates of a rich man in pleasing him claim the precedency can
i claim for myself
and so doth the fool
'tis foolish indeed let me set you both to school
first for your dwarf he's little and witty and every thing as it is little is pretty else why do men say to a creature of my shape so soon as they see him it's a pretty little ape
and why a pretty ape but for pleasing imitation of greater men's actions in a ridiculous fashion
beside this feat body of mine doth not crave half the meat drink and cloth one of your bulks will have
admit your fool's face be the mother of laughter yet for his brain it must always come after and though that do feed him 'tis a pitiful case his body is beholding to such a bad face
nano see give me my caps first go enquire
now cupid send it be mosca and with fair return
it is the beauteous madam would be
now torment on me
squire her in for she will enter or dwell here for ever nay quickly
that my fit were past
i fear a second hell too that my lothing this will quite expel my appetite to the other would she were taking now her tedious leave
lord how it threats me what i am to suffer
p i thank you good sir
'pray you signify unto your patron i am here
this band shews not my neck enough
i trouble you sir let me request you bid one of my women come hither to me
in good faith i am drest most favorably to day
it is no matter 'tis well enough
look see these petulant things how they have done this
i do feel the fever entering in at mine ears o for a charm to fright it hence
p come nearer is this curl in his right place or this
why is this higher then all the rest
you have not wash'd your eyes yet
or do they not stand even in your head
where is your fellow
anon she will beat her women because her nose is red
p i pray you view this tire forsooth are all things apt or no
one hair a little here sticks out forsooth
p does't so forsooth
and where was your dear sight when it did so forsooth
'pray you both approach and mend it
now by that light i muse you are not ashamed
i that have preach'd these things so oft unto you read you the principles argued all the grounds disputed every fitness every grace call'd you to counsel of so frequent dressings more carefully than of your fame or honour
p made you acquainted what an ample dowry the knowledge of these things would be unto you able alone to get you noble husbands at your return and you thus to neglect it
besides you seeing what a curious nation the italians are what will they say of me
"the english lady cannot dress herself
" here's a fine imputation to our country well go your ways and stay in the next room
this fucus was too course too it's no matter
good sir you will give them entertainment
the storm comes toward me
p how does my volpone
troubled with noise i cannot sleep i dreamt that a strange fury enter'd now my house and with the dreadful tempest of her breath did cleave my roof asunder
p believe me and i had the most fearful dream could i remember't out on my fate
i have given her the occasion how to torment me she will tell me hers
p me thought the golden mediocrity polite and delicate o if you do love me no more i sweat and suffer at the mention of any dream feel how i tremble yet
p alas good soul
the passion of the heart
seed pearl were good now boil'd with syrup of apples tincture of gold and coral citron pills your elicampane root myrobalanes ah me i have ta'en a grass hopper by the wing
p burnt silk and amber you have muscadel good in the house you will not drink and part
p no fear not that
i doubt we shall not get some english saffron half a dram would serve your sixteen cloves a little musk dried mints bugloss and barley meal she's in again
before i fain'd diseases now i have one
p and these applied with a right scarlet cloth
another flood of words
p shall i sir make you a poultice
no no no i am very well you need prescribe no more
p i have a little studied physic but now i'm all for music save in the forenoons an hour or two for painting
i would have a lady indeed to have all letters and arts be able to discourse to write to paint but principal as plato holds your music and so does wise pythagoras i take it is your true rapture when there is concent in face in voice and clothes and is indeed our sex's chiefest ornament
the poet as old in time as plato and as knowing says that your highest female grace is silence
p which of your poets
petrarch or tasso or dante
i have read them all
is every thing a cause to my distruction
p i think i have two or three of them about me
the sun the sea will sooner both stand still then her eternal tongue nothing can 'scape it
p here's pastor fido profess obstinate silence that's now my safest
p all our english writers i mean such as are happy in the italian will deign to steal out of this author mainly almost as much as from montagnie he has so modern and facile a vein fitting the time and catching the court ear
your petrarch is more passionate yet he in days of sonetting trusted them with much dante is hard and few can understand him
but for a desperate wit there's aretine only his pictures are a little obscene you mark me not
alas my mind is perturb'd
p why in such cases we must cure ourselves make use of our philosophy oh me
p and as we find our passions do rebel encounter them with reason or divert them by giving scope unto some other humour of lesser danger as in politic bodies there's nothing more doth overwhelm the judgment and cloud the understanding than too much settling and fixing and as 'twere subsiding upon one object
for the incorporating of these same outward things into that part which we call mental leaves some certain faeces that stop the organs and as plato says assassinate our knowledge
now the spirit of patience help me
p come in faith i must visit you more a days and make you well laugh and be lusty
my good angel save me
p there was but one sole man in all the world with whom i e'er could sympathise and he would lie you often three four hours together to hear me speak and be sometimes so rapt as he would answer me quite from the purpose like you and you are like him just
i'll discourse an't be but only sir to bring you asleep how we did spend our time and loves together for some six years
oh oh oh oh oh oh
p for we were coaetanei and brought up some power some fate some fortune rescue me
god save you madam
welcome welcome to my redemption
oh rid me of this my torture quickly there my madam with the everlasting voice the bells in time of pestilence ne'er made like noise or were in that perpetual motion
the cock pit comes not near it
all my house but now steam'd like a bath with her thick breath
a lawyer could not have been heard nor scarce another woman such a hail of words she has let fall
for hell's sake rid her hence
o i do not care i'll take her absence upon any price with any loss
madam p i have brought your patron a toy a cap here of mine own work
i had forgot to tell you i saw your knight where you would little think it
marry where yet if you make haste you may apprehend rowing upon the water in a gondole with the most cunning courtezan of venice
pursue them and believe your eyes leave me to make your gift
i knew 'twould take for lightly they that use themselves most license are still most jealous
mosca hearty thanks for thy quick fiction and delivery of me
now to my hopes what say'st thou
p but do you hear sir
i fear a paroxysm
p which way row'd they together
p i pray you lend me your dwarf
i pray you take him
your hopes sir are like happy blossoms fair and promise timely fruit if you will stay but the maturing keep you at your couch corbaccio will arrive straight with the will when he is gone i'll tell you more
my blood my spirits are return'd i am alive and like your wanton gamester at primero whose thought had whisper'd to him not go less methinks i lie and draw for an encounter
sir here conceal'd a you may here all
but pray you have patience sir the same's your father knocks i am compell'd to leave you
yet cannot my thought imagine this a truth
you are come too soon what meant you
did not i say i would send
yes but i fear'd you might forget it and then they prevent us
did e'er man haste so for his horns
a courtier would not ply it so for a place
well now there's no helping it stay here i'll presently return
where are you celia
you know not wherefore i have brought you hither
not well except you told me
now i will hark hither
a a sir your father hath sent word it will be half an hour ere he come and therefore if you please to walk the while into that gallery at the upper end there are some books to entertain the time and i'll take care no man shall come unto you sir
yes i will stay there
i do doubt this fellow
there he is far enough he can hear nothing and for his father i can keep him off
nay now there is no starting back and therefore resolve upon it i have so decreed
it must be done
nor would i move't afore because i would avoid all shifts and tricks that might deny me
sir let me beseech you affect not these strange trials if you doubt my chastity why lock me up for ever make me the heir of darkness
let me live where i may please your fears if not your trust
believe it i have no such humour all that i speak i mean yet i'm not mad nor horn mad see you
go to shew yourself obedient and a wife
i say it do so
was this the train
i've told you reasons what the physicians have set down how much it may concern me what my engagements are my means and the necessity of those means for my recovery wherefore if you be loyal and mine be won respect my venture
tut a breath there's no such thing in nature a mere term invented to awe fools
what is my gold the worse for touching clothes for being look'd on
why this is no more
an old decrepit wretch that has no sense no sinew takes his meat with others' fingers only knows to gape when you do scald his gums a voice a shadow and what can this man hurt you
what spirit is this hath enter'd him
and for your fame that's such a jig as if i would go tell it cry it on the piazza
who shall know it but he that cannot speak it and this fellow whose lips are in my pocket
save yourself if you'll proclaim't you may i know no other shall come to know it
are heaven and saints then nothing
will they be blind or stupid
good sir be jealous still emulate them and think what hate they burn with toward every sin
i grant you if i thought it were a sin i would not urge you
should i offer this to some young frenchman or hot tuscan blood that had read aretine conn'd all his prints knew every quirk within lust's labyrinth and were professed critic in lechery and i would look upon him and applaud him this were a sin but here 'tis contrary a pious work mere charity for physic and honest polity to assure mine own
canst thou suffer such a change
thou art mine honour mosca and my pride my joy my tickling my delight
please you draw near sir

nay fly me not
nor let thy false imagination that i was bed rid make thee think i am so thou shalt not find it
i am now as fresh as hot as high and in as jovial plight as when in that so celebrated scene at recitation of our comedy for entertainment of the great valois i acted young antinous and attracted the eyes and ears of all the ladies present to admire each graceful gesture note and footing
come my celia let us prove while we can the sports of love time will not be ours for ever he at length our good will sever spend not then his gifts in vain suns that set may rise again but if once we loose this light 'tis with us perpetual night

the heads of parrots tongues of nightingales the brains of peacocks and of estriches shall be our food and could we get the phoenix though nature lost her kind she were our dish

whilst we in changed shapes act ovid's tales thou like europa now and i like jove then i like mars and thou like erycine so of the rest till we have quite run through and wearied all the fables of the gods
then will i have thee in more modern forms attired like some sprightly dame of france brave tuscan lady or proud spanish beauty sometimes unto the persian sophy's wife or the grand signior's mistress and for change to one of our most artful courtezans or some quick negro or cold russian and i will meet thee in as many shapes where we may so transfuse our wandering souls out at our lips and score up sums of pleasures that the curious shall not know how to tell them as they flow and the envious when they find what there number is be pined

free the forced lady or thou diest impostor
but that i'm loth to snatch thy punishment out of the hand of justice thou shouldst yet be made the timely sacrifice of vengeance before this altar and this dross thy idol
lady let's quit the place it is the den of villany fear nought you have a guard and he ere long shall meet his just reward
fall on me roof and bury me in ruin
become my grave that wert my shelter
i am unmask'd unspirited undone betray'd to beggary to infamy where shall i run most wretched shame of men to beat out my unlucky brains
o that his well driv'n sword had been so courteous to have cleft me down unto the navel ere i lived to see my life my hopes my spirits my patron all thus desperately engaged by my error
woe on thy fortune
and my follies sir
thou hast made me miserable
who would have thought he would have harken'd so
what shall we do
i know not if my heart could expiate the mischance i'd pluck it out
will you be pleased to hang me
or cut my throat
and i'll requite you sir
let us die like romans since we have lived like grecians
i hear some footing officers the saffi come to apprehend us
i do feel the brand hissing already at my forehead now mine ears are boring
to your couch sir you make that place good however
guilty men suspect what they deserve still
why how now mosca
o undone amazed sir
your son i know not by what accident acquainted with your purpose to my patron touching your will and making him your heir enter'd our house with violence his sword drawn sought for you call'd you wretch unnatural vow'd he would kill you
yes and my patron
this act shall disinherit him indeed here is the will
right and well be you as careful now for me
my life sir is not more tender'd i am only yours
will he die shortly think'st thou
i fear he'll outlast may
no last out may sir
could'st thou not give him a dram
o by no means sir
nay i'll not bid you
this is a knave i see
did he hear me
o sir most timely welcome scarce to the discovery of your tricks i fear
you are his and mine also
what device is this about a will
a plot for you sir
come put not your foists upon me i shall scent them
did you not hear it
yes i hear corbaccio hath made your patron there his heir
'tis true by my device drawn to it by my plot with hope your patron should reciprocate
and you have promised
for your good i did sir
nay more i told his son brought hid him here where he might hear his father pass the deed being persuaded to it by this thought sir that the unnaturalness first of the act and then his father's oft disclaiming in him which i did mean t'help on would sure enrage him to do some violence upon his parent on which the law should take sufficient hold and you be stated in a double hope truth be my comfort and my conscience my only aim was to dig you a fortune out of these two old rotten sepulchres i cry thee mercy mosca
worth your patience and your great merit sir
and see the change
you must help sir
whilst we expected the old raven in comes corvino's wife sent hither by her husband what with a present
no sir on visitation i'll tell you how anon and staying long the youth he grows impatient rushes forth seizeth the lady wounds me makes her swear or he would murder her that was his vow to affirm my patron to have done her rape which how unlike it is you see
and hence with that pretext he's gone to accuse his father defame my patron defeat you where is her husband
let him be sent for straight
sir i'll go fetch him
bring him to the scrutineo
this must be stopt
o you do nobly sir
alas 'twas labor'd all sir for your good nor was there want of counsel in the plot but fortune can at any time o'erthrow the projects of a hundred learned clerks sir
will't please you sir to go along
patron go in and pray for our success
need makes devotion heaven your labour bless
a p i told you sir it was a plot you see what observation is
you mention'd me for some instructions i will tell you sir since we are met here in this height of venice some few perticulars i have set down only for this meridian fit to be known of your crude traveller and they are these
i will not touch sir at your phrase or clothes for they are old
sir i have better
p pardon i meant as they are themes
o sir proceed i'll slander you no more of wit good sir
p first for your garb it must be grave and serious very reserv'd and lock'd not tell a secret on any terms not to your father scarce a fable but with caution make sure choice both of your company and discourse beware you never speak a truth how
p not to strangers for those be they you must converse with most others i would not know sir but at distance so as i still might be a saver in them you shall have tricks else past upon you hourly
and then for your religion profess none but wonder at the diversity of all and for your part protest were there no other but simply the laws o' the land you could content you nic
machiavel and monsieur bodin both were of this mind
then must you learn the use and handling of your silver fork at meals the metal of your glass these are main matters with your italian and to know the hour when you must eat your melons and your figs
is that a point of state too
p here it is for your venetian if he see a man preposterous in the least he has him straight he has he strips him
i'll acquaint you sir i now have lived here 'tis some fourteen months within the first week of my landing here all took me for a citizen of venice i knew the forms so well and nothing else
p i had read contarene took me a house dealt with my jews to furnish it with moveables well if i could but find one man one man to mine own heart whom i durst trust i would what what sir
p make him rich make him a fortune he should not think again
i would command it
p with certain projects that i have which i may not discover
if i had but one to wager with i would lay odds now he tells me instantly
p one is and that i care not greatly who knows to serve the state of venice with red herrings for three years and at a certain rate from rotterdam where i have correspendence
there's a letter sent me from one of the states and to that purpose he cannot write his name but that's his mark
p no a cheesemonger
there are some others too with whom i treat about the same negociation and i will undertake it for 'tis thus
i'll do't with ease i have cast it all your hoy carries but three men in her and a boy and she shall make me three returns a year so if there come but one of three i save if two i can defalk but this is now if my main project fail
then you have others
p i should be loth to draw the subtle air of such a place without my thousand aims
i'll not dissemble sir where'er i come i love to be considerative and 'tis true i have at my free hours thought upon some certain goods unto the state of venice which i do call "my cautions" and sir which i mean in hope of pension to propound to the great council then unto the forty so to the ten
my means are made already by whom
p sir one that though his place be obscure yet he can sway and they will hear him
p sir such as they are put it in their mouths what they should say sometimes as well as greater i think i have my notes to shew you good sir
p but you shall swear unto me on your gentry not to anticipate i sir
p nor reveal a circumstance my paper is not with me
o but you can remember sir
p my first is concerning tinder boxes
you must know no family is here without its box
now sir it being so portable a thing put case that you or i were ill affected unto the state sir with it in our pockets might not i go into the arsenal or you come out again and none the wiser
p go to then
i therefore advertise to the state how fit it were that none but such as were known patriots sound lovers of their country should be suffer'd to enjoy them in their houses and even those seal'd at some office and at such a bigness as might not lurk in pockets
p my next is how to enquire and be resolv'd by present demonstration whether a ship newly arrived from soria or from any suspected part of all the levant be guilty of the plague and where they use to lie out forty fifty days sometimes about the lazaretto for their trial i'll save that charge and loss unto the merchant and in an hour clear the doubt
p or i will lose my labour
'my faith that's much
p nay sir conceive me
it will cost me in onions some thirty livres which is one pound sterling
p beside my water works for this i do sir
first i bring in your ship 'twixt two brick walls but those the state shall venture on the one i strain me a fair tarpauling and in that i stick my onions cut in halves the other is full of loop holes out at which i thrust the noses of my bellows and those bellows i keep with water works in perpetual motion which is the easiest matter of a hundred
now sir your onion which doth naturally attract the infection and your bellows blowing the air upon him will show instantly by his changed colour if there be contagion or else remain as fair as at the first
now it is known 'tis nothing
you are right sir
p i would i had my note
'faith so would i but you have done well for once sir
p were i false or would be made so i could shew you reasons how i could sell this state now to the turk spite of their galleys or their pray you sir pol
p i have them not about me
they are there sir
this is my diary wherein i note my actions of the day
pray you let's see sir
"notandum a rat had gnawn my spur leathers notwithstanding i put on new and did go forth but first i threw three beans over the threshold
item i went and bought two tooth picks whereof one i burst immediatly in a discourse with a dutch merchant 'bout ragion del stato
from him i went and paid a moccinigo for piecing my silk stockings by the way i cheapen'd sprats and at st
" 'faith these are politic notes
p sir i do slip no action of my life but thus i quote it
believe me it is wise
p nay sir read forth
a p where should this loose knight be trow
why then he's fast
p ay he plays both with me
i pray you stay
this heat will do more harm to my complexion than his heart is worth i do not care to hinder but to take him
how it comes off
with a young gentleman
p that same's the party in man's apparel
'pray you sir jog my knight i'll be tender to his reputation however he demerit
p 'tis she indeed sir you shall know her
she is were she not mine a lady of that merit for fashion and behaviour and for beauty i durst compare it seems you are not jealous that dare commend her
p nay and for discourse being your wife she cannot miss that
p madam here is a gentleman pray you use him fairly he seems a youth but he is p none
p yes one has put his face as soon into the world p you mean as early
p why in this habit sir you apprehend me well master would be this doth not become you i had thought the odour sir of your good name had been more precious to you that you would not have done this dire massacre on your honour one of your gravity and rank besides
but knights i see care little for the oath they make to ladies chiefly their own ladies
p now by my spurs the symbol of my knighthood lord how his brain is humbled for an oath
p i reach you not
p right sir your policy may bear it through thus
sir a word with you
i would be loth to contest publicly with any gentlewoman or to seem froward or violent as the courtier says it comes too near rusticity in a lady which i would shun by all means and however i may deserve from master would be yet t'have one fair gentlewoman thus be made the unkind instrument to wrong another and one she knows not ay and to persever in my poor judgment is not warranted from being a solecism in our sex if not in manners
p sweet madam come nearer to your aim
p marry and will sir
since you provoke me with your impudence and laughter of your light land syren here your sporus your hermaphrodite what's here
poetic fury and historic storms
p the gentleman believe it is of worth and of our nation
p ay your white friars nation
come i blush for you master would be i and am asham'd you should have no more forehead than thus to be the patron or st
george to a lewd harlot a base fricatrice a female devil in a male outside
p nay and you be such a one i must bid adieu to your delights
the case appears too liquid
p ay you may carry't clear with your state face
but for your carnival concupiscence who here is fled for liberty of conscience from furious persecution of the marshal her will i dis'ple
this is fine i'faith
and do you use this often
is this part of your wit's exercise 'gainst you have occasion
madam p go to sir
do you hear me lady
why if your knight have set you to beg shirts or to invite me home you might have done it a nearer way by far p this cannot work you out of my snare
why am i in it then
indeed your husband told me you were fair and so you are only your nose inclines that side that's next the sun to the queen apple
p this cannot be endur'd by any patience
what is the matter madam
p if the senate right not my quest in this i'll protest them to all the world no aristocracy
what is the injury lady
p why the callet you told me of here i have ta'en disguised
what means your ladyship
the creature i mention'd to you is apprehended now before the senate you shall see her p where
i'll bring you to her
this young gentleman i saw him land this morning at the port
how has my judgment wander'd
sir i must blushing say to you i have err'd and plead your pardon
what more changes yet
p i hope you have not the malice to remember a gentlewoman's passion
if you stay in venice here please you to use me sir will you go madam
p 'pray you sir use me
in faith the more you see me the more i shall conceive you have forgot our quarrel
sir politick would be
no sir politick bawd
to bring me thus acquainted with his wife
well wise sir pol since you have practised thus upon my freshman ship i'll try your salt head what proof it is against a counter plot
well now you know the carriage of the business your constancy is all that is required unto the safety of it
is the lie safely convey'd amongst us
knows every man his burden
but knows the advocate the truth
o sir by no means i devised a formal tale that salv'd your reputation
but be valiant sir
i fear no one but him that this his pleading should make him stand for a co heir co halter
hang him we will but use his tongue his noise as we do croakers here
ay what shall he do
when we have done you mean
why we'll think sell him for mummia he's half dust already
do not you smile to see this buffalo how he does sport it with his head
i should if all were well and past
sir only you are he that shall enjoy the crop of all and these not know for whom they toil
but you shall eat it
worshipful sir mercury sit upon your thundering tongue or the french hercules and make your language as conquering as his club to beat along as with a tempest flat our adversaries but much more yours sir
here they come have done
i have another witness if you need sir i can produce
sir i have her
the like of this the senate never heard of
'twill come most strange to them when we report it
the gentlewoman has been ever held of unreproved name
so has the youth
the more unnatural part that of his father
more of the husband
i not know to give his act a name it is so monstrous
but the impostor he's a thing created to exceed example
and all after times
i never heard a true voluptuary discribed but him
appear yet those were cited
all but the old magnifico volpone
why is not he here
please your fatherhoods here is his advocate himself's so weak so feeble what are you
his parasite his knave his pandar i beseech the court he may be forced to come that your grave eyes may bear strong witness of his strange impostures
upon my faith and credit with your virtues he is not able to endure the air
we will see him
your fatherhoods fit pleasures be obey'd but sure the sight will rather move your pities than indignation
may it please the court in the mean time he may be heard in me i know this place most void of prejudice and therefore crave it since we have no reason to fear our truth should hurt our cause
then know most honour'd fathers i must now discover to your strangely abused ears the most prodigious and most frontless piece of solid impudence and treachery that ever vicious nature yet brought forth to shame the state of venice
this lewd woman that wants no artificial looks or tears to help the vizor she has now put on hath long been known a close adulteress to that lascivious youth there not suspected i say but known and taken in the act with him and by this man the easy husband pardon'd whose timeless bounty makes him now stand here the most unhappy innocent person that ever man's own goodness made accused
for these not knowing how to owe a gift of that dear grace but with their shame being placed so above all powers of their gratitude began to hate the benefit and in place of thanks devise to extirpe the memory of such an act wherein i pray your fatherhoods to observe the malice yea the rage of creatures discover'd in their evils and what heart such take even from their crimes but that anon will more appear
this gentleman the father hearing of this foul fact with many others which daily struck at his too tender ears and grieved in nothing more than that he could not preserve himself a parent his son's ills growing to that strange flood at last decreed to disinherit him
these be strange turns
the young man's fame was ever fair and honest
so much more full of danger is his vice that can beguile so under shade of virtue
but as i said my honour'd sires his father having this settled purpose by what means to him betray'd we know not and this day appointed for the deed that parricide i cannot style him better by confederacy preparing this his paramour to be there enter'd volpone's house who was the man your fatherhoods must understand design'd for the inheritance there sought his father but with what purpose sought he him my lords
i tremble to pronounce it that a son unto a father and to such a father should have so foul felonious intent
it was to murder him when being prevented by his more happy absence what then did he
not check his wicked thoughts no now new deeds mischief doth ever end where it begins an act of horror fathers
he dragg'd forth the aged gentleman that had there lain bed rid three years and more out of his innocent couch naked upon the floor there left him wounded his servant in the face and with this strumpet the stale to his forged practice who was glad to be so active i shall here desire your fatherhoods to note but my collections as most remarkable thought at once to stop his father's ends discredit his free choice in the old gentleman redeem themselves by laying infamy upon this man to whom with blushing they should owe their lives
what proofs have you of this
most honoured fathers i humbly crave there be no credit given to this man's mercenary tongue
his soul moves in his fee
this fellow for six sols more would plead against his maker
you do forget yourself
nay nay grave fathers let him have scope can any man imagine that he will spare his accuser that would not have spared his parent
well produce your proofs
i would i could forget i were a creature
has he had an oath
what must i do now
speak to the knave
i'll have my mouth first stopt with earth my heart abhors his knowledge i disclaim in him
but for what cause
the mere portent of nature
he is an utter stranger to my loins
have they made you to this
i will not hear thee monster of men swine goat wolf parricide
speak not thou viper
sir i will sit down and rather wish my innocence should suffer then i resist the authority of a father
this woman please your fatherhoods is a whore of most hot exercise more than a partrich upon record no more
neighs like a jennet
preserve the honour of the court
i shall and modesty of your most reverend ears
and yet i hope that i may say these eyes have seen her glued unto that piece of cedar that fine well timber'd gallant and that here the letters may be read through the horn that make the story perfect
there's no shame in this now is there
or if i said i hoped that she were onward to her damnation if there be a hell greater than whore and woman a good catholic may make the doubt
his grief hath made him frantic
look to the woman
stand from about her
give her the air
what can you say
my wound may it please your wisdoms speaks for me received in aid of my good patron when he mist his sought for father when that well taught dame had her cue given her to cry out a rape
o most laid impudence
fathers sir be silent you had your hearing free so must they theirs
i do begin to doubt the imposture here
this woman has too many moods
grave fathers she is a creature of a most profest and prostituted lewdness
most impetuous unsatisfied grave fathers
may her feignings not take your wisdoms but this day she baited a stranger a grave knight with her loose eyes and more lascivious kisses
this man saw them together on the water in a gondola
here is the lady herself that saw them too without who then had in the open streets pursued them but for saving her knight's honour
these things they strike with wonder
i am turn'd a stone
p ay this same is she
out thou chameleon harlot
now thine eyes vie tears with the hyaena
dar'st thou look upon my wronged face
i cry your pardons i fear i have forgettingly transgrest against the dignity of the court no madam
p and been exorbitant you have not lady
these proofs are strong
p surely i had no purpose to scandalise your honours or my sex's
we do believe it
p surely you may believe it
p indeed you may my breeding is not so coarse we know it
p to offend with pertinacy lady p such a presence
we well think it
p you may think it
what witnesses have you to make good your report
and heaven that never fails the innocent
these are no testimonies
not in your courts where multitude and clamour overcomes
nay then you do wax insolent
a here here the testimony comes that will convince and put to utter dumbness their bold tongues see here grave fathers here's the ravisher the rider on men's wives the great impostor the grand voluptuary
do you not think these limbs should affect venery
or these eyes covet a concubine
pray you mark these hands are they not fit to stroke a lady's breasts
perhaps he doth dissemble
would you have him tortured
i would have him proved
best try him then with goads or burning irons put him to the strappado i have heard the rack hath cured the gout 'faith give it him and help him of a malady be courteous
i'll undertake before these honour'd fathers he shall have yet as many left diseases as she has known adulterers or thou strumpets
o my most equal hearers if these deeds acts of this bold and most exorbitant strain may pass with sufferance what one citizen but owes the forfeit of his life yea fame to him that dares traduce him
which of you are safe my honour'd fathers
i would ask with leave of your grave fatherhoods if their plot have any face or colour like to truth
or if unto the dullest nostril here it smell not rank and most abhorred slander
i crave your care of this good gentleman whose life is much endanger'd by their fable and as for them i will conclude with this that vicious persons when they're hot and flesh'd in impious acts their constancy abounds damn'd deeds are done with greatest confidence
take them to custody and sever them
'tis pity two such prodigies should live
let the old gentleman be return'd with care i'm sorry our credulity hath wrong'd him
these are two creatures
i've an earthquake in me
their shame even in their cradles fled their faces
you have done a worthy service to the state sir in their discovery
you shall hear ere night what punishment the court decrees upon them
we thank your fatherhoods
how like you it
i'd have your tongue sir tipt with gold for this i'd have you be the heir to the whole city the earth i'd have want men ere you want living they're bound to erect your statue in st
signior corvino i would have you go and shew yourself that you have conquer'd
it was much better that you should profess yourself a cuckold thus than that the other should have been prov'd
nay i consider'd that now it is her fault then it had been yours
true i do doubt this advocate still
i'faith you need not i dare ease you of that care
i trust thee mosca
as your own soul sir
now for your business sir
none else not be careful then
rest you with both your eyes sir
and look that all whatever be put in jewels plate moneys household stuff bedding curtains
only the advocate's fee must be deducted
i'll pay him now you'll be too prodigal
sir i must tender it
two chequines is well
he talk'd a great while you must consider that sir
well there's three i'll give it him
do so and there's for thee
what horrid strange offence did he commit 'gainst nature in his youth worthy this age
you see sir how i work unto your ends take you no notice
no i'll leave you
all is yours the devil and all good advocate
madam i'll bring you home
p no i'll go see your patron
that you shall not i'll tell you why
my purpose is to urge my patron to reform his will and for the zeal you have shewn to day whereas before you were but third or fourth you shall be now put in the first which would appear as begg'd if you were present
therefore p you shall sway me
a well i am here and all this brunt is past
i ne'er was in dislike with my disguise till this fled moment here 'twas good in private but in your public cave whilst i breathe
'fore god my left leg began to have the cramp and i apprehended straight some power had struck me with a dead palsy well
i must be merry and shake it off
a many of these fears would put me into some villanous disease should they come thick upon me i'll prevent 'em
give me a bowl of lusty wine to fright this humour from my heart
'tis almost gone already i shall conquer
any device now of rare ingenious knavery that would possess me with a violent laughter would make me up again
so so so so
this heat is life 'tis blood by this time mosca
does the day look clear again
are we recover'd and wrought out of error into our way to see our path before us
is our trade free once more
was it not carried learnedly
and stoutly good wits are greatest in extremities
it were a folly beyond thought to trust any grand act unto a cowardly spirit you are not taken with it enough methinks
o more than if i had enjoy'd the wench the pleasure of all woman kind's not like it
why now you speak sir
we must here be fix'd here we must rest this is our master piece we cannot think to go beyond this
thou hast play'd thy prize my precious mosca
nay sir to gull the court and quite divert the torrent upon the innocent
yes and to make so rare a music out of discords right
that yet to me's the strangest how thou hast borne it
that these being so divided 'mongst themselves should not scent somewhat or in me or thee or doubt their own side
true they will not see't
too much light blinds them i think
each of them is so possest and stuft with his own hopes that any thing unto the contrary never so true or never so apparent never so palpable they will resist it like a temptation of the devil
merchants may talk of trade and your great signiors of land that yields well but if italy have any glebe more fruitful than these fellows i am deceiv'd
did not your advocate rare
o "my most honour'd fathers my grave fathers under correction of your fatherhoods what face of truth is here
if these strange deeds may pass most honour'd fathers" i had much ado to forbear laughing
it seem'd to me you sweat sir
in troth i did a little
but confess sir were you not daunted
in good faith i was a little in a mist but not dejected never but still my self
i think it sir
now so truth help me i must needs say this sir and out of conscience for your advocate he has taken pains in faith sir and deserv'd in my poor judgment i speak it under favour not to contrary you sir very richly well to be cozen'd
troth and i think so too by that i heard him in the latter end
o but before sir had you heard him first draw it to certain heads then aggravate then use his vehement figures i look'd still when he would shift a shirt and doing this out of pure love no hope of gain 'tis right
i cannot answer him mosca as i would not yet but for thy sake at thy entreaty i will begin even now to vex them all this very instant
call the dwarf and eunuch forth
shall we have a jig now
what you please sir
go straight give out about the streets you two that i am dead do it with constancy sadly do you hear
impute it to the grief of this late slander
what do you mean sir
o i shall have instantly my vulture crow raven come flying hither on the news to peck for carrion my she wolfe and all greedy and full of expectation and then to have it ravish'd from their mouths
i will have thee put on a gown and take upon thee as thou wert mine heir shew them a will open that chest and reach forth one of those that has the blanks i'll straight put in thy name
a it will be rare sir
ay when they ev'n gape and find themselves deluded yes
and thou use them scurvily
dispatch get on thy gown
a but what sir if they ask after the body
say it was corrupted
i'll say it stunk sir and was fain to have it coffin'd up instantly and sent away
any thing what thou wilt
hold here's my will
get thee a cap a count book pen and ink papers afore thee sit as thou wert taking an inventory of parcels i'll get up behind the curtain on a stool and hearken sometime peep over see how they do look with what degrees their blood doth leave their faces o 'twill afford me a rare meal of laughter
a your advocate will turn stark dull upon it
it will take off his oratory's edge
but your clarissimo old round back he will crump you like a hog louse with the touch
o sir look for him to morrow morning with a rope and dagger to visit all the streets he must run mad
my lady too that came into the court to bear false witness for your worship yes and kist me 'fore the fathers when my face flow'd all with oils
why your gold is such another med'cine it dries up all those offensive savours it transforms the most deformed and restores them lovely as 'twere the strange poetical girdle
jove could not invent t' himself a shroud more subtle to pass acrisius' guards
it is the thing makes all the world her grace her youth her beauty
i think she loves me
she's jealous of you
dost thou say so
hark there's some already
it is the vulture he has the quickest scent
i'll to my place thou to thy posture
but mosca play the artificer now torture them rarely
how now my mosca
"turkey carpets nine" taking an inventory
"two suits of bedding tissue" where's the will
let me read that the while
a so set me down and get you home
is he come now to trouble us
"of cloth of gold two more" is it done mosca
"of several velvets eight" i like his care
dost thou not hear
is the hour come mosca
ay now they muster
what does the advocate here or this corbaccio
what do these here
is his thread spun
"eight chests of linen" o my fine dame would be too
mosca the will that i may shew it these and rid them hence
"six chests of diaper four of damask
is that the will
"down beds and bolsters" rare
now they begin to flutter they never think of me
look see see see
how their swift eyes run over the long deed unto the name and to the legacies what is bequeath'd them there "ten suits of hangings" ay in their garters mosca
now their hopes are at the gasp
my advocate is dumb look to my merchant he has heard of some strange storm a ship is lost he faints my lady will swoon
old glazen eyes he hath not reach'd his despair yet
all these are out of hope i am sure the man
but mosca "two cabinets
" is this in earnest
"one of ebony" or do you but delude me
the other mother of pearl i am very busy
good faith it is a fortune thrown upon me "item one salt of agate" not my seeking
p do you hear sir
perfum'd box" 'pray you forbear you see i'm troubled "made of an onyx" p how
to morrow or next day i shall be at leisure to talk with you all

nay raise no tempest with your looks but hark you remember what your ladyship offer'd me to put you in an heir go to think on it and what you said e'en your best madams did for maintenance and why not you
go home and use the poor sir pol your knight well for fear i tell some riddles go be melancholy

will you not take your dispatch hence yet
methinks of all you should have been the example
why should you stay here
hear you do not you know i know you an ass and that you would most fain have been a wittol if fortune would have let you
that you are a declared cuckold on good terms
this pearl you'll say was yours
i'll not deny't but thank you
it may be so
why think that these good works may help to hide your bad
i'll not betray you although you be but extraordinary and have it only in title it sufficeth go home be melancholy too or mad
how his villany becomes him
certain he doth delude all these for me
o his four eyes have found it
i am cozen'd cheated by a parasite slave harlot thou hast gull'd me
stop your mouth or i shall draw the only tooth is left
are not you he that filthy covetous wretch with the three legs that here in hope of prey have any time this three years snuff'd about with your most grovelling nose and would have hired me to the poisoning of my patron sir
are not you he that have to day in court profess'd the disinheriting of your son

'twere a rare motion to be seen in fleet street
ay in the term
or smithfield in the fair
methinks 'tis but a melancholy sight
farewell most politic tortoise
p where's my lady
knows she of this
i know not sir
o i shall be the fable of all feasts the freight of the gazetti ship boy's tale and which is worst even talk for ordinaries
my lady's come most melancholy home and says sir she will straight to sea for physic
p and i to shun this place and clime for ever creeping with house on back and think it well to shrink my poor head in my politic shell
a a a am i then like him
o sir you are he no man can sever you
but what am 'fore heaven a brave clarissimo thou becom'st it
pity thou wert not born one
if i hold my made one 'twill be well
i'll go and see what news first at the court
my fox is out of his hole and ere he shall re enter i'll make him languish in his borrow'd case except he come to composition with me
go recreate yourselves abroad go sport
so now i have the keys and am possest
since he will needs be dead afore his time i'll bury him or gain by him i am his heir and so will keep me till he share at least
to cozen him of all were but a cheat well placed no man would construe it a sin let his sport pay for it this is call'd the fox trap
a they say the court is set
we must maintain our first tale good for both our reputations
why mine's no tale my son would there have kill'd me
that's true i had forgot mine is i am sure
but for your will sir
ay i'll come upon him for that hereafter now his patron's dead
sir much joy unto you
the sudden good dropt down upon you where
and none knows how from old volpone sir
let not your too much wealth sir make you furious
dost thou mock me
you mock the world sir did you not change wills
belike you are the man signior corvino
'faith you carry it well you grow not mad withal i love your spirit you are not over leaven'd with your fortune
you should have some would swell now like a wine fat with such an autumn did he give you all sir
troth your wife has shewn herself a very woman but you are well you need not care you have a good estate to bear it out sir better by this chance except corbaccio have a share
you will not be acknown sir why 'tis wise
thus do all gamesters at all games dissemble no man will seem to win
exeunt corvino and corbaccio
here comes my vulture heaving his beak up in the air and snuffing
outstript thus by a parasite
a slave would run on errands and make legs for crumbs
well what i'll do the court stays for your worship
i e'en rejoice sir at your worship's happiness and that it fell into so learned hands that understand the fingering what do you mean
i mean to be a suitor to your worship for the small tenement out of reparations that to the end of your long row of houses by the piscaria it was in volpone's time your predecessor ere he grew diseased a handsome pretty custom'd bawdy house as any was in venice none dispraised but fell with him his body and that house decay'd together
come sir leave your prating
why if your worship give me but your hand that i may have the refusal i have done
'tis a mere toy to you sir candle rents as your learn'd worship knows what do i know
marry no end of your wealth sir god decrease it
what mockst thou my misfortune
his blessing on your heart sir would 'twere more
now to my first again at the next corner
see in our habit
see the impudent varlet
that i could shoot mine eyes at him like gun stones
but is this true sir of the parasite
again to afflict us
in good faith sir i'm heartily grieved a beard of your grave length should be so over reach'd
i never brook'd that parasite's hair methought his nose should cozen there still was somewhat in his look did promise the bane of a clarissimo
knave methinks yet you that are so traded in the world a witty merchant the fine bird corvino that have such moral emblems on your name should not have sung your shame and dropt your cheese to let the fox laugh at your emptiness
sirrah you think the privilege of the place and your red saucy cap that seems to me nail'd to your jolt head with those two chequines can warrant your abuses come you hither you shall perceive sir i dare beat you approach
no haste sir i do know your valour well since you durst publish what you are sir
tarry i'd speak with you
sir sir another time nay now
i were a wise man would stand the fury of a distracted cuckold
upon 'em mosca save me
the air's infected where he breathes
turn upon the vulture
well flesh fly it is summer with you now your winter will come on
good advocate prithee not rail nor threaten out of place thus thou'lt make a solecism as madam says
get you a biggin more your brain breaks loose
would you have me beat the insolent slave throw dirt upon his first good clothes
this same is doubtless some familiar
sir the court in troth stays for you
i am mad a mule that never read justinian should get up and ride an advocate
had you no quirk to avoid gullage sir by such a creature
i hope you do but jest he has not done it 'tis but confederacy to blind the rest
you are the heir
a strange officious troublesome knave
thou dost torment me
i know it cannot be sir that you should be cozen'd 'tis not within the wit of man to do it you are so wise so prudent and 'tis fit that wealth and wisdom still should go together
are all the parties here
all but the advocate
and here he comes
then bring them forth to sentence
o my most honour'd fathers let your mercy once win upon your justice to forgive i am distracted what will he do now
o i know not which to address myself to first whether your fatherhoods or these innocents will he betray himself
whom equally i have abused out of most covetous ends the man is mad
for which now struck in conscience here i prostate myself at your offended feet for pardon
o heaven how just thou art
i am caught in mine own noose be constant sir nought now can help but impudence
it is not passion in me reverend fathers but only conscience conscience my good sires that makes me now tell trueth
that parasite that knave hath been the instrument of all
where is that knave
grave fathers this man's distracted he confest it now for hoping to be old volpone's heir who now is dead how
dead since grave fathers o sure vengeance
stay then he was no deceiver
o no none the parasite grave fathers
he does speak out of mere envy 'cause the servant's made the thing he gaped for please your fatherhoods this is the truth though i'll not justify the other but he may be some deal faulty
ay to your hopes as well as mine corvino but i'll use modesty
pleaseth your wisdoms to view these certain notes and but confer them as i hope favour they shall speak clear truth
the devil has enter'd him
or bides in you
we have done ill by a public officer to send for him if he be heir
him that they call the parasite
'tis true he is a man of great estate now left
go you and learn his name and say the court entreats his presence here but to the clearing of some few doubts
this same's a labyrinth
stand you unto your first report
my state my life my fame where is it
are at the stake is yours so too
the advocate's a knave and has a forked tongue speak to the point
so is the parasite too
i do beseech your fatherhoods read but those and credit nothing the false spirit hath writ it cannot be but he's possest grave fathers
a to make a snare for mine own neck
and run my head into it wilfully
when i had newly 'scaped was free and clear out of mere wantonness
o the dull devil was in this brain of mine when i devised it and mosca gave it second he must now help to sear up this vein or we bleed dead
who let you loose
whither go you now
what to buy gingerbread
or to drown kitlings
sir master mosca call'd us out of doors and bid us all go play and took the keys
did master mosca take the keys
these are my fine conceits
i must be merry with a mischief to me
what a vile wretch was i that could not bear my fortune soberly
i must have my crotchets and my conundrums
well go you and seek him his meaning may be truer than my fear
bid him he straight come to me to the court thither will i and if't be possible unscrew my advocate upon new hopes when i provoked him then i lost myself
these things can ne'er be reconciled
he here professeth that the gentleman was wrong'd and that the gentlewoman was brought thither forced by her husband and there left
how ready is heaven to those that pray
but that volpone would have ravish'd her he holds utterly false knowing his impotence
grave fathers he's possest again i say possest nay if there be possession and obsession he has both
here comes our officer
the parasite will straight be here grave fathers
you might invent some other name sir varlet
did not the notary meet him
not that i know
his coming will clear all
yet it is misty
may't please your fatherhoods whispers volt
sir the parasite will'd me to tell you that his master lives that you are still the man your hopes the same and this was only a jest how
sir to try if you were firm and how you stood affected
art sure he lives
do i live sir
i was too violent
sir you may redeem it they said you were possest fall down and seem so i'll help to make it good
god bless the man
stop your wind hard and swell see see see see
he vomits crooked pins
his eyes are set like a dead hare's hung in a poulter's shop
his mouth's running away
do you see signior
now it is in his belly
now in his throat
ay i perceive it plain
'twill out 'twill out
see where it flies in shape of a blue toad with a bat's wings
do you not see it sir
i think i do
he comes to himself
where am take good heart the worst is past sir
what accident is this
sudden and full of wonder
if he were possest as it appears all this is nothing
he has been often subject to these fits
shew him that writing do you know it sir
deny it sir forswear it know it not
yes i do know it well it is my hand but all that it contains is false
what maze is this
is he not guilty then whom you there name the parasite
grave fathers no more than his good patron old volpone
why he is dead
o no my honour'd fathers he lives how
this is subtler yet
you said he was dead
here comes the gentleman make him way
a proper man and were volpone dead a fit match for my daughter
mosca i was almost lost the advocate had betrayed all but now it is recovered all's on the hinge again say i am living
what busy knave is this
most reverend fathers i sooner had attended your grave pleasures but that my order for the funeral of my dear patron did require me mosca
whom i intend to bury like a gentleman
ay quick and cozen me of all
and come about again
it is a match my daughter is bestow'd
will you give me half
first i'll be hang'd
i know your voice is good cry not so loud
sir did not you affirm volpone was alive
yes and he is this gentleman told me so
thou shalt have half
whose drunkard is this same
speak some that know him i never saw his face
i cannot now afford it you so cheap
the officer told me
i did grave fathers and will maintain he lives with mine own life
and that this creature told me
i was born with all good stars my enemies
most grave fathers if such an insolence as this must pass upon me i am silent 'twas not this for which you sent i hope
let him be whipt
wilt thou betray me
and taught to bear himself toward a person of his rank
i humbly thank your fatherhoods
and lose all that i have
if i confess it cannot be much more
sir are you married
they will be allied anon i must be resolute the fox shall here uncase
nay now my ruins shall not come alone your match i'll hinder sure my substance shall not glue you nor screw you into a family
i am volpone and this is my knave this his own knave this avarice's fool this a chimera of wittol fool and knave and reverend fathers since we all can hope nought but a sentence let's not now dispair it
you hear me brief
may it please your fatherhoods silence
the knot is now undone by miracle
nothing can be more clear
or can more prove these innocent
give them their liberty
heaven could not long let such gross crimes be hid
if this be held the high way to get riches may i be poor
this is not the gain but torment
these possess wealth as sick men possess fevers which trulier may be said to possess them
can you plead aught to stay the course of justice
if you can speak
we beg favour and mercy
you hurt your innocence suing for the guilty
stand forth and first the parasite you appear t'have been the chiefest minister if not plotter in all these lewd impostures and now lastly have with your impudence abused the court and habit of a gentleman of venice being a fellow of no birth or blood for which our sentence is first thou be whipt then live perpetual prisoner in our gallies
i thank you for him
bane to thy wolvish nature
deliver him to the saffi
thou volpone by blood and rank a gentleman canst not fall under like censure but our judgment on thee is that thy substance all be straight confiscate to the hospital of the incurabili and since the most was gotten by imposture by feigning lame gout palsy and such diseases thou art to lie in prison cramp'd with irons till thou be'st sick and lame indeed
this is call'd mortifying of a fox
thou voltore to take away the scandal thou hast given all worthy men of thy profession art banish'd from their fellowship and our state
bring him near we here possess thy son of all thy state and confine thee to the monastery of san spirito where since thou knewest not how to live well here thou shalt be learn'd to die well
you shall know anon sir
thou corvino shalt be straight embark'd from thine own house and row'd round about venice through the grand canale wearing a cap with fair long asses' ears instead of horns and so to mount a paper pinn'd on thy breast to the berlina yes and have mine eyes beat out with stinking fish bruised fruit and rotten eggs 'tis well
i am glad i shall not see my shame yet
and to expiate thy wrongs done to thy wife thou art to send her home to her father with her dowry trebled and these are all your judgments
which may not be revoked
now you begin when crimes are done and past and to be punish'd to think what your crimes are away with them
let all that see these vices thus rewarded take heart and love to study 'em
mischiefs feed like beasts till they be fat and then they bleed
the seasoning of a play is the applause
now though the fox be punish'd by the laws he yet doth hope there is no suffering due for any fact which he hath done 'gainst you if there be censure him here he doubtful stands if not fare jovially and clap your hands
