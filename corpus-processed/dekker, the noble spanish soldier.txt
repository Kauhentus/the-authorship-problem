the poet might conceive a complete satisfaction upon the stage's approbation but the printer rests not there knowing that that which was acted and approved upon the stage might be no less acceptable in print
it is now communicated to you whose leisure and knowledge admits of reading and reason
your judgement now this posthumous assures himself will well attest his predecessor's endeavours to give content to men of the ablest quality such as intelligent readers are here conceived to be
i could have troubled you with a longer epistle but i fear to stay you from the book which affords better words and matter than i can
so the work modestly depending in the scale of your judgement the printer for his part craves your pardon hoping by his promptness to do you greater service as convenience shall enable him to give you more or better testimony of his entireness towards you
enter in magnificent state to the sound of loud music the king and queen as from church attended by the cardinal count malateste marquis daenia roderigo valasco alba carlo and ladies in waiting
the king and queen with courtly compliments salute and part
she exits with one half attending her
king cardinal and the other half stay the king seeming angry and desirous to be rid of them
king cardinal daenia and others remain
give us what no man here is master of breath
leave us pray my father cardinal can by the physic of philosophy set all again in order
exeunt king and cardinal remain
how is it with you sir
as with a ship now beat with storms now safe
the storms are vanished and having you my pilot i not only see shore but harbour i to you will open the book of a black sin deep printed in me
oh father my disease lies in my soul
the old wound sir
yes that it festers inwards
for though i have a beauty to my bed that even creation envies at as wanting stuff to make such another yet on her pillow i lie by her but an adulterer and she as an adulteress
she is my queen and wife yet but my strumpet though the church set on the seal of marriage
good onaelia niece to our lord high constable of spain was precontracted mine
yet when i stung your conscience with remembrance of the act your ears were deaf to counsel
now to untie the knot with your new queen would shake your crown half from your head
even troy though she has wept her eyes out would find tears to wail my kingdom's ruins
what will you do then
she has that contract written sealed by you and other churchmen witnesses unto it
a kingdom should be given for that paper
i would not for what lies beneath the moon be made a wicked engine to break in pieces that holy contract
'tis my soul's aim to tie it upon a faster knot
i do not see how you can with safe conscience get it from her
oh i know i wrestle with a lioness
to imprison her and force her to it i dare not
what king did ever say dare not'
i must have it a bastard have i by her and that cock will have i fear sharp spurs if he crow after him that trod for him
something must be done both to the hen and the chicken
haste you therefore to sad onaelia tell her i'm resolved to give my new hawk bells and let her fly
my queen i'm weary of and her will marry
to this our text add you what gloss you please the secret drifts of kings are depthless seas
exeunt a table set out covered with black
the king's defaced picture at one end and a crucifix at the other
onaelia dressed in black walking discontentedly weeping to the crucifix
oh sorrow sorrow say where do'st thou dwell
in the lowest room of hell
art thou born of human race
i have a fury's face
art thou in city town or court
i to every place resort
o why into the world is sorrow sent
men afflicted best repent
what dost thou feed on
what takest thou take pleasure in
to weep to sigh to sob to pine to groan to wring my hands to sit alone
oh when oh when shall sorrow quiet have
never never never never never till she finds a grave
no lesson madam but lacrymae's
if you had buried nine husbands so much water as you might squeeze out of an onion had been tears enough to cast away upon fellows that cannot thank you
sorrow becomes me best
a suit of laugh and lie down would wear better
what should i do to be merry cornego
but what's the best mirth in the world
marry this to see much say little do little get little spend little and want nothing
oh but there is a mirth beyond all these this picture has so vexed me i'm half mad to spite it therefore i'll sing any song thyself shall tune
say then what mirth is best
why then madam what i knock out now is the very marrowbone of mirth and this it is
the best mirth for a lawyer is to have fools to his clients for citizens to have noblemen pay for their debts for tailors to have store of satin brought in for then how little soever their houses are they will be sure to have large yards
the best mirth for bawds is to have fresh handsome whores and for whores to have rich gulls come aboard their pinnaces for then they are sure to build galleasses these to such souls are mirth but to mine none
exit cornego enter cardinal
peace to you lady
i will not sin so much as to hope for peace and 'tis a mock ill suits your gravity
i come to knit the nerves of your lost strength to build your ruins up to set you free from this your voluntary banishment and give new being to your murdered fame
what aesculapius can do this
'tis from the king i come
a name i hate
oh i am deaf now to your embassy
hear what i speak
your language breathed from him is death's sad doom upon a wretch condemned
is it such poison
yes and were you crystal what the king fills you with would make you break
you should my lord be like these robes you wear pure as the dye and like that reverend shape nurse thoughts as full of honour zeal and purity
you should be the court dial and direct the king with constant motion be ever beating like to clock hammers on his iron heart to make it sound clear and to feel remorse
you should unlock his soul wake his dead conscience which like a drowsy sentinel gives leave for sin's vast armies to beleaguer him
his ruins will be asked for at your hands
i have raised up a scaffolding to save both him and you from falling
do but hear me
be dumb for ever
let your fears thus die by all the sacred relics of the church and by my holy orders what i minister is even the spirit of health
i'll drink it down into my soul at once
what conjurations can more bind my oath
but did you swear in earnest
no marvel for my hopes have been so drowned i still despair say on
pray that again my lord
his wrongs to me
his wrongs to you
the sense of sin has pierced his soul
has turned his eyes into his leprous bosom and like a king vows execution on all his traitorous passions
intends in person presently to beg forgiveness for his acts from heaven and you
will he turn bigamist
before the morrow sun hath rode half his day's journey will send home his queen as one that stains his bed and can produce nothing but bastard issue to his crown
lost in wonder and amazement
i am so stored with joy that i can now strongly wear out more years of misery than i have lived
you need not here is the king
with pardon sir i will prevent you and charge upon you first
but stay what mean these emblems of distress
my picture so defaced opposed against a holy cross
room hung in black and you dressed like chief mourner at a funeral
look back upon your guilt dear sir and then the cause that now seems strange explains itself
this and the image of my living wrongs is still confronted by me to beget grief like my shame whose length may outlive time
this cross the object of my wounded soul to which i pray to keep me from despair that ever as the sight of one throws up mountains of sorrow on my accursed head
turning to that mercy may check despair and bind my hands from wilful violence
but who has played the tyrant with me thus and with such dangerous spite abused my picture
the guilt of that lays claim sir to yourself for being by you ransacked of all my fame robbed of mine honour and dear chastity made by your act the shame of all my house the hate of good men and the scorn of bad the song of broom men and the murdering vulgar and left alone to bear up all these ills by you begun my breast was filled with fire and wrapped in just disdain and like a woman on that dumb picture wreaked i my passions
and wished it had been pardon me sir my wrongs were great and my revenge swelled high
i will descend and cease to be a king to leave my judging part freely confessing thou canst not give thy wrongs too ill a name
and here to make thy apprehension full and seat thy reason in a sound belief i vow tomorrow ere the rising sun begins his journey with all ceremonies due to the church to seal our nuptials to prive thy son with full consent of state spain's heir apparent born in wedlock's vows
and will you swear to this
by this i swear
oh you have sworn false oaths upon that book
why then by this
take heed you print it deeply how for your concubine bride i cannot say she stains your bed with black adultery and though her fame masks in a fairer shape than mine to the world's eye yet king you know mine honour is less strumpeted than hers however butchered in opinion
this way for her the contract which thou hast by best advice of all our cardinals today shall be enlarged till it be made past all dissolving
then to our council table shall she be called that read aloud she told the church commands her quick return for florence with such a dower as spain received with her and that they will not hazard heaven's dire curse to yield to a match unlawful which shall taint the issue of the king with bastardy
this done in state majestic come you forth our new crowned queen in sight of all our peers
to doubt of this were treason because the king has sworn it
and will keep it
deliver up the contract then that i may make this day end with thy misery
here as the dearest jewel of my fame locked i this parchment from all viewing eyes
this your indenture held alone the life of my supposed dead honour yet behold into your hands i redeliver it
oh keep it sir as you should keep that vow to which being signed by heaven even angels bow
onaelia passes the document to the king
'tis in the lion's paw and who dares snatch it
now to your beads and crucifix again
pray there may come embassadors from france their followers are good customers
save me from madness
'twill raise the price being the king's mistress
you do but counterfeit to mock my joys
are there eyes in heaven to see this
call and try here's a whore's curse to fall in that belief which her sins nurse
exit king enter cornego
what quarter of the moon has she cut out now
my lord puts me into a wise office to be a mad woman's keeper
where is the king thou slave
let go your hold or i'll fall upon you as i am a man
thou treacherous caitiff where is the king
he's gone but not so far as you are
crack all in sunder oh you battlements and grind me into powder what powder
when did you ever see a woman grinded into powder
i am sure some of your sex powder men and pepper them too
is there a vengeance yet lacking to my ruin
let it fall now let it fall upon me
no there has been too much fallen upon you already
thou villain leave thy hold i'll follow him like a raised ghost i'll haunt him break his sleep fright him as he is embracing his new leman til want of rest bids him run mad and die for making oaths bawds to his perjury
pray be more seasoned if he make any bawds he did ill for there is enough of that fly blown flesh already
i'm left quite naked now all gone all all
no madam not all for you cannot be rid of me
here comes your uncle
attired in robes of vengeance are you uncle
'twas never full till now and in this torrent all my hopes lie drowned
instruct me in the cause
the king the contract
that's cud enough for you to chew upon
the king the contract
the mischief i divine which proving true shall kindle fires in spain to melt his crown even from his head
here's the decree of fate a black deed must a black deed expiate
enter balthazar having been slighted by the dons
thou god of good apparel what strange fellows are bound to do thee honour
mercer's books show men's devotions to thee
heaven cannot hold a saint so stately
do not my dons know me because i'm poor in clothes
stood my beaten tailor plaiting my rich hose my silk stocking man drawing upon my lordship's courtly calf pairs of imbroidered things whose golden clocks strike deeper to the faithful shop keeper's heart than into mine to pay him
had my barber perfumed my lousy thatch here and poked out me tusks more stiff than are a cats muschatoes these pied winged butterflies had known me then
save thee illustrious don
sir is the king at leisure to speak spanish with a poor soldier
no no sirah you no
you don with the ochre face i wish to have thee but on a breach stifling with smoke and fire
and for thy no but whiffing gunpowder out of an iron pipe i would but ask thee if thou would'st on and if thou did'st cry no thou should'st read canon law
i'd make thee roar and wear cut beaten satin
i would pay thee though thou payest not thy mercer
signor is the king at leisure
to hear a soldier speak
i am no ear picker to sound his hearing that way
are you of court sir
yes the king's barber
that's his ear picker
your name i pray
don cockadillio if soldier thou hast suits to beg at court i shall descend so low as to betray thy paper to the hand royal
i beg you whorson muscod my petition is written on my bosom in red wounds
i am no barber surgeon
you yellowhammer why shaver that such poor things as these only made up of tailor's shreds and merchant's silken rags and 'pothecary drugs to lend their breath sophisticated smells when their rank guts stink worse than cowards in the heat of battle
such whaleboned doublet rascals that owe more to laundresses and seamsters for laced linen than all their race from their great grand father to this their reign in clothes were ever worth
these excrements of silk worms
oh that such flies do buzz about the beams of majesty like earwigs tickling a king's yielding ear with that court organ flattery when a soldier must not come near the court gates twenty score but stand for want of clothes though he win towns amongst the almsbasket men
his best reward being scorned to be a fellow to the blackguard
why should a soldier being the world's right arm be cut thus by the left a courtier
is the world all ruff and feather and nothing else
shall i never see a tailor give his coat with a difference from a gentleman
enter king alanzo carlo cockadillio
let us make haste to meet thee
how art thou altered
do you not know him
yes sir the brave soldier employed against the moors half turned moor
i'll honour thee reach him a chair that table and now aeneas like let thine own trumpet sound forth thy battle with those slavish moors
my music is a cannon a pitched field my stage furies the actors blood and vengeance the scene death the story a sword imbrued with blood the pen that writes and the poet a terrible buskined tragical fellow with a wreath about his head of burning match instead of bays
on to the battle
'tis here without bloodshed
this our main battalia that the van this the vaw these the wings here we fight there they fly here they insconce and here our sconces lay seventeen moons on the cold earth
this satisfies my eye but now my ear must have his music too
am i come from doing to talking
the hardest part for a soldier to play is to prate well
our tongues are fifes drums petronels muskets culverin and cannon
these are our roarers the clocks which we go by are our hands
thus we reckon ten our swords strike eleven and when steel targets of proof clatter one against another then 'tis noon that's the height and the heat of the day of battle
to that heat we came our drums beat pikes were shaken and shivered swords and targets clashed and clattered muskets rattled cannons roared men died groaning brave laced jerkings and feathers looked pale tottered rascals fought pell mell
here fell a wing there heads were tossed like footballs legs and arms quarrelled in the air and yet lay quietly on the earth
horses trampled upon heaps of carcasses troops of carbines tumbled wounded from their horses we besiege moors and famine us mutinies bluster and are calm
i vowed not to doff mine armour though my flesh were frozen to it and turn into iron nor to cut head nor beard till they yielded
my hairs and oath are of one length for with caesar thus write i mine own story veni vidi vici
a pitched field quickly fought
our hand is thine and because thou shalt not murmur that thy blood was lavished forth for an ungrateful man demand what we can give thee and 'tis thine
'tis thine rise soldier's best accord when wounds of wrong are healed up by the sword
onaelia knocks loudly at the door
let me come in i'll kill the treacherous king the murderer of mine honour let me come in
what woman's voice is that
bar out that fiend
i'll tear him with my nails let me come in let me come in help help me
keep her from following me
they are ready sir
let a quick summons call our lords together this disease kills me
sir i would be private with you
forebear us but see the doors are well guarded
exeunt king and balthazar remain
will you sir promise to give me freedom of speech
yes i will take it speak any thing 'tis pardoned
you are a whoremaster
do you send me to win towns for you abroad and you lose a kingdom at home
the fairest in the world the kingdom of your fame your honour
i'll be plain with you
much mischief is done by the mouth of a cannon but the fire begins at a little touch hole
you heard what nightingale sung to you even now
angels erred but once and fell but you sir spit in heaven's face every minute and laugh at it
laugh still follow your courses do
let your vices run like your kennels of hounds yelping after you till they pluck down the fairest head in the herd everlasting bliss
take sin as the english snuff tobacco and scornfully blow the smoke in the eyes of heaven the vapour flies up in clouds of bravery
but when 'tis out the coal is black your conscience and the pipe stinks
a sea of rosewater cannot sweeten your corrupted bosom
nay spit thy venom
'tis aqua coelestis no venom
for when you shall clasp up these two books never to be opened again when by letting fall that anchor which can never more be weighed up your mortal navigation ends
then there's no playing at spurn point with thunderbolts
a vintner then for unconscionable reckoning or a tailor for unmeasurable items shall not answer in half that fear you must
i will follow truth at the heels though her foot beat my gums in pieces
the barber that draws out a lion's tooth curseth his trade and so shalt thou
because you have beaten a few base born moors me think'st thou to chastise
what is past i pardon because i made the key to unlock thy railing but if thou dar'st once more be so untuned i'll sent thee to the galleys
who are without there how now
enter guards and attendants drawn
yes yes i am but 'tis no point of weapon can rescue me
go presently and summon all our chief grandees cardinals and lords of spain to meet in council instantly
we called you forth to execute a business of another strain but 'tis no matter now
thou diest when next thou furrowest up our brow
exit balthazar enter cardinal rodrigo alba daenia valasco
i find my sceptre shaken by enchantments charactered in this parchment which to unloose i'll practice only counter charms of fire and blow the spells of lightening into smoke fetch burning tapers
exit attendant who returns with light
give me audience sir
my apprehension opens me a way to a close fatal mischief worse than this you strive to murder
oh this act of yours alone shall give your dangers life which else can never grow to height
do sir but read a book here closed up which too late you opened now blotted by you with foul marginal notes
you are so sir
if i be then here's my first mad fit
for honour's sake for love you bear to conscience reach the flames grandees and lords of spain be witness all what here i cancel
read do you know this bond
our hands are to it
'tis your confirmed contract with my sad kinswoman but wherefore sir now is your rage on fire in such a presence to have it mourn in ashes
marquis daenia we'll lend that tongue when this no more can speak
i am deaf played the full concert of the spheres unto me upon their loudest strings so burn that witch who would dry up the tree of all spain's glories but that i purge her sorceries by fire
troy lies in cinders
let your oracles now laugh at me if i have been deceived by their ridiculous riddles
why good father now you may freely chide why was your zeal ready to burst in showers to quench our fury
fury indeed you give it proper name
what have you done
closed up a festering wound which rots the heart
like a bad surgeon labouring to pluck out from your eye a mote you thrust the eye clean out
th'art mad ex tempore what eye
which is that wound
that scroll which now you make the black indenture of your lust although eat up in flames is printed here in me in him in these in all that saw it in all that ever did but hear 'twas yours
the scold of the whole world fame will anon rail with her thousand tongues at this poor shift which gives your sin a flame greater than that you lend the paper
you to quench a wild fire cast oil upon it
oil to blood shall turn i'll lose a limb before the heart shall mourn
exeunt daenia and alba remain
he's mad with rage or joy
with both with rage to see his follies checked with fruitless joy because he hopes his contract is cut off which divine justice more exemplifies
wrapped up in clouds of lightning
what has he done
saw you the contract torn
as i did here a minion swear he threatened
he tore it not but burned it
and heaven with us to witness
well that fire will prove a catching flame to burn his kingdom
no more trust not the air with our projections let us all revenge wrongs done to our most noble kinswoman
action is honours language swords are tongues which both speak best and best do right our wrongs
enter onaelia from one way cornego another
madam there's a bear without to speak with you a bear
it's a man all hair and that's as bad
'tis one master captain balthazar
i do not know that balthazar
he desires to see you and if you love a water spaniel before he be shorn see him
let him come in
hist a duck a duck
there she is sir
a soldier's good wish bless you lady
good wishes are most welcome sir to me so many bad ones blast me
do you not know me
i scarce know myself
i have been at tennis madam with the king
i gave him fifteen and all his faults which is much and now i come to toss a ball with you
i am bandied too much up and down already
yes she has been struck under line master soldier
i conceit you dare you trust yourself alone with me
i have been laden with such weights of wrong that heavier cannot press me
when man and woman are put together some egg of villainy is sure to be sat upon
what would you say to him should kill this man that hath you so dishonoured
oh i would crown him with thanks praise gold and tender of my life
shall i be that german fencer and beat all the knocking boys before me
shall i kill him
there's music in the tongue that dares but speak it
that fiddle then is in me this arm can do it by poniard poison or pistol but shall i do it indeed
one step to human bliss is sweet revenge
what made you love him
his most goodly shape married to royal virtues of his mind
yet now you would divorce all that goodness and why
for a little lechery of revenge
the burr that sticks in your throat is a throne
let him out of his mess of kingdoms cut out but one and lay sicily aragon or naples or any else upon your trencher and you will praise bastard for the sweetest wine in the world and call for another quart of it
'tis not because the man has left you but because you are not the woman you would be that mads you
a she cuckold is an untameable monster
monster of men thou are thou bloody villain traitor to him who never injured thee
dost thou profess arms and art bound in honour to stand up like a brazen wall to guard thy king and country and would'st thou ruin both
you spur me on to it
true worse am i then the horridest fiend in hell to murder him who i once loved too well for thou i could run mad and tear my hair and kill that godless man that turned me vile though i am cheated by a purjurious prince who has done wickedness at which even heaven shakes when the sun beholds it o yet i'd rather ten thousand poisoned poniards stab my breast than one should touch his
i'll play myself the hangman and will butcher thee if thou but prickest his finger
sayest thou me so
give me thy goll thou are a noble girl
i did play the devil's part and roar in a feigned voice but i am the honestest devil that ever spat fire
i would not drink that infernal draft of a king's blood to go reeling to damnation for the weight of the world in diamonds
art thou not counterfeit
now by my scars i am not
i'll call thee honest soldier then and woo thee to be an often visitant
your servant yet must i be a stone upon a hill for thou i do no good i'll not lie still
enter malateste and the queen
when first you came from florence would the world had with a universal dire eclipse been overwhelmed no more to gaze on day that you to spain had never found the way here to be lost forever
we from one climate drew suspiration as thou then hast eyes to read my wrongs so be thy head an engine to raise up ponderous mischief to the height and then thy hands the executioners
a true italian spirit is a ball of wild fire hurting most when it seems spent
great ships on small rocks beating oft are rent
and so let spain by us
but malateste why from the presence did you single me into this gallery
to show you madam the picture of yourself but so defaced and mangled by proud spaniards it would whet a sword to arm the poorest florentine in your just wrongs
let's see that picture
here 'tis then time is not scarce four days old since i and certain dons sharp witted fellows and of good rank were with two jesuits grave profound scholars in deep argument of various propositions
at the last question was moved touching your marriage and the king's pre contract
so and what followed
whether it were a question moved by chance or spitefully of purpose i being there and your own countryman i cannot tell
but when much tossing had bandied both the king and you as pleased those that took up the racquets
in conclusion the father jesuits to whose subtle music every ear there was tied stood with their lives in stiff defence of this opinion oh pardon me if i must speak their language
that the most catholic king in marrying you keeps you but as his whore
are we their themes
and that medina's niece onaelia is his true wife
her bastard son they said the king being dead should claim and wear the crown and whatsoever children you shall bear to be but bastards in the highest degree as being begotten in adultery
we will not grieve at this but with hot vengeance beat down this armed mischief
what whirlwinds can we raise to blow this storm back in their faces who thus shoot at me
if i were fit to be your councillor thus would i speak feign that you are with child
the mother of the maids and some worn ladies who oft have guilty being to court great bellies may though it not be so get you with child with swearing that 'tis true
say 'tis believed or that it so doth prove
the joy thereof together with these earthquakes which will shake all spain if they their prince do disinherit so borne of such a queen being only daughter to such a brave spirit as duke of florence
all this buzzed into the king he cannot choose but charge that all the bells in spain echo up this joy to heaven that bonfires change the night to a high noon with beams of sparkling flames and that in churches organs charmed with prayers speak loud for your most safe delivery
what fruits grow out of these
these you must stick as here and there spring weeds in banks of flowers spies amongst the people who shall lay their ears to every mouth and seal to you their whispering
'tis a plummet to sound spanish hearts how deeply they are yours
besides a guesse is hereby made of any faction that shall combine against you which the king seeing if then he will not rouse him like a dragon to guard his golden fleece and rid his harlot and her base bastard hence either by death or in some traps of state ensnare them both let his own ruins crush him
this goes to trial
be thou my magic book which reading o'er their counterspells we'll break or if the king will not by strong hand fix me in his throne but that i must be held spain's blazing star be it an ominous charm to call up war
enter cornego and onaelia
here's a parcel of man's flesh has been hanging up and down all this morning to speak with you
is't not some executioner
i see nothing about him to hang in but his garters
sent from the king to warn me of my death i prithee bid him welcome
he says he is a poet
then bid him better welcome
belike he's come to write my epitaph some scurvy thing i'll warrant
madam my love presents this book unto you
i am not worthy of a line unless at that line hang some hook to choke me onaelia reads book
to the most honoured lady onaelia
fellow thou liest i'm most dishonoured thou should'st have writ to the most wronged lady
the title of this book is not to me i tear it therefore as mine honour's torn
your verses are lamed in some of their feet master poet
what does it treat of
of the solemn triumphs set forth at coronation of the queen
hissing the poet's whirlwind blast thy lines
com'st thou to mock my tortures with her triumphs
when her funerals are past crown thou a dedication to my joys and thou shalt swear each line a golden verse
cornego burn this idol
your book shall come to light sir
exit cornego with book
i have read legends of disastrous dames will none set pen to paper for poor me
canst write a bitter satire
brainless people do call them libels
darest thou write a libel
i dare mix gall and poison with my ink
do it then for me
and every line must be a whip to draw blood
and to dare the stab from him it touches
he that writes such libels as you call them must launch wide the sores of men's corruptions and even search to the quick for dead flesh or for rotten cores a poet's ink can better cure some sores than surgeon's balsam
undertake that cure and crown thy verse with bays
madam i'll do it but i must have the party's character
i do not love to pluck the quills with which i make pens out of a lion's claw
should i be bitter 'gainst the king i shall have scurvy ballads made of me sung to the hanging tune
i dare not madam
this baseness follows your profession
you are like common beadles apt to lash almost to death poor wretches not worth striking but fawn with slavish flattery on damned vices so great men act them
you clap hands at those where the true poet indeed doth scorn to guild a gaudy tomb with glory of his verse which coffins stinking carrion
no his lines are free as his invention
no base fear can shake his pen to temporise even with kings the blacker are their crimes he louder sings
go go thou canst not write 'tis but my calling the muses help that i may be inspired
canst a woman be a poet sir
yes madam best of all
for poesie is but feigning feigning is to lie and women practice lying more than men
nay but if i should write i would tell truth
how might i reach a lofty strain
thus madam books music wine brave company and good cheer make poets to soar high and sing most clear
are they born poets
my misery is then a poet sure for time has given it an eternity
what sort of poets are there
two sorts lady the great poets and the small poets
which do you call the great
no but such as have great heads which emptied forth fill all the world with wonder at their lines fellows which swell big with the wind of praise
the small ones are but shrimps of poesie
which in the kingdom now is the best poet
and which the worst
say i turn poet what should i get
alas i have got too much of that already opinion is my evidence judge and jury
mine own guilt and opinion now condemn me
i'll therefore be no poet no nor make ten muses of your nine
i'll swear for this verses though freely born like slaves are sold i crown thy lines with bays thy love with gold so fare thou well
our pen shall honour thee
exit poet enter cornego
the poet's book madam has got the inflammation of the liver it died of a burning fever
what shall i do cornego
for this poet has filled me with a fury
i could write strange satires now against adulterers and marriage breakers
i believe you madam but here comes your uncle
enter medina alanzo carlo alba sebastian daenia
turn your brains round and recollect your spirits and see your noble friends and kinsmen ready to pay revenge his due
that word revenge startles my sleepy soul now thoroughly wakened by the fresh object of my hapless child whose wrongs reach beyond mine
how doth my sweet mother
how doth my prettiest boy
wrongs like great whirlwinds shake highest battlements
few for heaven would care should they be ever happy
they are half gods who both in good days and good fortune share
i have no part in either
you shall in both can swords but cut the way
i care not much so you but gently strike him and that my child escape the lightening
for that our nerves are knit is there not here a promising face of manly princely virtues and shall so sweet a plant be rooted out by him that ought to fix it fast in the ground
sebastian what will you do to him that hurts your mother
the king my father shall kill him i trow
but sweet cousin the king loves not your mother
i'll make him love her when i am a king
la you there's in him a king's heart already
as therefore we before together vowed lay all your warlike hands upon my sword and swear
will you swear to kill me uncle
oh not for twenty worlds
nay then draw and spare not for i love fighting
stand in the midst sweet coz we are your guard
these hammers shall for thee beat out a crown if all hit right
swear therefore noble friends by your high bloods by true nobility by what you owe religion owe to your country owe to the raising your posterity by love you bear to virtue and to arms the shield of innocence swear not to sheath your swords when once drawn forth
oh not to kill him for twenty thousand worlds
will you be quiet
your swords when once drawn forth till they have forced yon godless perjurous perfidious man
pray rail not at him so
you're idle till they have forced him to cancel his late lawless bond he sealed at the high altar to his florentine strumpet and in his bed lay this his troth plight wife
i i that's well
to this we swear
uncle i swear too
our forces let's unite be bold and secret and lion like with open eyes let's sleep streams smooth and slowly running are most deep
enter king queen malateste valasco lopez roderigo and guards
the presence door be guarded let none enter on forfeit of your lives without our knowledge
oh you are false physicians all unto me you bring me poison but no antidotes
yourself that poison brews
i will i must speak more
my child yet newly quickened in my womb is blasted with the fires of bastardy
who dares once but think so in his dream
medina's faction preached it openly
be cursed he and his faction
oh how i labour for these preventions
but so cross is fate my ills are ne'r hid from me but their cures
what's to be done
that which being left undone your life lies at the stake
let them be breathless both brat and mother
she plays true music sir
the mischiefs you are drenched in are so full you need not fear to add to them
since now no way is left to guard thy rest secure but by a means like this
all spain rings forth medina's name and his confederates
all his allies and friends rush into troops like raging torrents
and loud trumpet forth your perjuries
seducing the wild people and with rebellious faces threatening all
i shall be massacred in this their spleen ere i have time to guard myself
i feel the fire already falling
planted at guarded gate with a strict charge that none shall enter but by your command
let them be doubled
i am full of thoughts a thousand wheels toss my incertain fears there is a storm in my hot boiling brains which rises without wind
enter balthazar drawn he strikes one of the guards who falls
one of the guards is slain keep off the murderer
i am none sir
there's a man dropped down by thee
thou desperate fellow thus press in upon us
is murder all the story we shall read
what king can stand when thus his subjects bleed
what has thou done
played even the wolf and from a fold committed to my charge stolen and devoured one of the flock
you have sheep enough for all that sir
i have killed none though
or if i have mine own blood shed in your quarrels may beg my pardon
my business was in haste to you
i would not have thy sin scored on my head for all the indian treasury
i prithee tell me suppose thou had'st our pardon oh can that cure thy wounded conscience can there my pardon help thee
yet having deserved well both of spain and us we will not pay thy worth with loss of life but banish thee for ever
for a groom's death
we banish thee our court and kingdom
a king that fosters men so dipped in blood may be called merciful but never good
be gone upon thy life
the fellow is not dead but wounded sir
in our lodging stay that rough fellow he's the man shall do't
haste or my hopes are lost
why are you sad sir
for thee paulina swell my troubled thoughts like billows beaten by two warring winds
be you ruled but ruled by me i'll make a calm smooth as the breast of heaven
you as your fortunes tie you are inclined to have the blow given
'tis found in balthazar
true but stayed by me for this
his spirit is hot and rugged but so honest that his soul will never turn devil to do it
put it to trial
retire a little hither i'll send for him offer repeal and favours if he do it
but if he deny you have no finger in't and then his doom of banishment stands good
be happy in thy workings i obey
exit king stay lopez
step to our lodging lopez and instantly bid malateste bring the banished balthazar to us
thrive my black plots the mischiefs i have set must not so die
ills must new ills beget
enter malateste and balthazar
what hot poisoned custard must i put my spoon into now
none for mine honour is now thy protection
which noble soldier she will pawn for thee but never forfeit
'tis a fair gage keep it
i am thy friend and marked thee
when the king sentenced thee to banishment fire sparkled from thine eyes of rage and grief
rage to be doomed so for a groom so base and grief to lose thy country
thou hast killed none the milk sop is but wounded thou are not banished
if i were i lose nothing i can make any country mine
i have a private coat for italian stilettos i can be treacherous with the walloon drunk with the dutch a chimney sweeper with the irish a gentleman with the welsh and true arrant thief with the english
what then is my country to me
the king who rap'd with fury banished thee shall give thee favours yield but to destroy what him distempers
and what is the dish i must dress
only the cutting off a pair of lives
i love no red wine healths
the king commands it you are but executioner
an office that will hold so long as hemp lasts
why do not you beg the office sir
thy victories in field never did crown thee as this one act shall
prove but that 'tis done
follow him close he's yielding
thou shalt be called thy country's patriot for quenching out a fire now newly kindling in factious bosoms and shalt thereby save more noble spaniards lives than thou slew moors
art thou yet converted
read me then medina's niece by a contract from the king lays claim to all that's mine my crown my bed
a son she has by him must fill the throne if her great faction can but work that wonder
i do with gaping ears
i swell with hopeful issue to the king
a brave don call you mother
of this danger the fear afflicts the king
cannot much blame him
if therefore by the riddance of this dame riddance
the meaning on't is murder
stab her or so that's all
that spain be free from frights the king from fears and i now held his infamy be called queen the treasure of the kingdom shall lie open to pay thy noble darings
i'll do it provided i hear jove call to me though he roars
i must have the king's hand to this warrant else i dare not serve it upon my conscience
behold the king is come
i found the metal hard but with oft beating he's now so softened he shall take impression from any seal you give him
balthazar come hither listen
whatsoe'er our queen has importuned thee to touching onaelia niece to the constable and her young son my voice shall second it and sign her promise
or strangling stabbing smothering
any way so 'tis done
but i will have sir this under your own hand that you desire it you plot it set me on to't
pen ink and paper
king writes and signs document
and then as large a pardon as law and wit can engross for me
thou shalt have my pardon
a word more sir pray will you tell me one thing
yes any thing dear balthazar
suppose i have your strongest pardon can that cure my wounded conscience
can there your pardon help me
you not only knock the ewe on the head but cut the innocent lamb's throat too yet you are no butcher
is this thy promised yielding to an act so wholesome for thy country
i would not have this sin scored on my head for all the indian treasury
that song no more
do this and i will make thee a great man
is there no farther trick in't but my blow your purse and my pardon
no nets upon my life to entrap thee
these knuckles work it
be confident and sudden
subjects may stumble when kings walk astray
thine acts shall be a new apocrypha
enter medina alba carlo and daenia met by balthazar with a poniard and a pistol
you met a hydra
see if one head fails another with a sulphurous beak stands yawning
what hath raised up this devil
a great man's vices that can raise all hell
what would you call that man who under sail in a most goodly ship wherein he ventures his life fortunes and honours yet in a fury should hew the mast down cast sails overboard fire all the tacklings and to crown this madness should blow up all the decks burn th'oaken ribs and in that combat 'twix two elements leap desperately and drown himself in the seas
what were so brave a fellow
a brave black villain
that's all that brave black villain dwells in me if i be that black villain
but i am not
a nobler character prints out my brow which you may thus read i was banished spain for emptying a court hogshead but repealed so i would ere my reeking iron was cold promise to give it a deep crimson dye in none hear stay no none hear
basely to stab a woman your wronged niece and her most innocent son sebastian
the boar now foams with wetting
what has blunted thy weapons point at these
a sign at which few dwell pure honesty
i am a vassal to medina's house he taught me first the a b c of war
e'er i was truncheon high i had the stile on beardless captain writing then but boy and shall i now turn slave to him that fed me with cannon bullets and taught me ostrich like to digest iron and steel
yet i yielded with willow bendings to commanding breaths
of king and queen
with supple hams and an ill boding look i vowed to do it
yet lest some choke pear of state policy should stop my throat and spoil my drinking pipe see like his cloak i hung at the king's elbow till i had got his hand to sign my life
balthazar passes over the document signed by the king
shall we see this and sleep
no whilst these wake
'tis the king's hand
think you me a coiner no no thou art thy self still noble balthazar
i ever knew thee honest and the mark stands still upon thy forehead
else flea the skin off
i ever knew thee valiant and to scorn all acts of baseness
i have seen this man write in the field such stories with his sword that our best chieftains swore there was in him as 'twere a new philosophy of fighting his deeds were so punctilious
in one battle when death so nearly missed my ribs he struck three horses stone dead under me
this man three times that day even through the jaws of danger redeemed me up and i shall print it ever stood over my body with colossus thighs whilst all the thunder bolts which war could throw fell on his head
and balthazar thou canst not be now but honest still and valiant still not to kill boys and women
my biter here eats no such meat
go fetch the marked out lamb for slaughter hither good fellow soldier aid him and stay mark give this false fire to the believing king that the child's sent to heaven but that the mother stands rocked so strong with friends ten thousand billows cannot once shake her
yet one word more
your counsel noble friends
hark balthazar because nor eyes nor tongues shall by loud larums that the poor boy lives question thy false report the child shall closely mantled in darkness forthwith be conveyed to the monastery of saint paul
despatch then be quick
this fellow is some angel dropped from heaven to preserve innocence
he is a wheel of swift and turbulent motion
i have trusted him yet will not hang on him too many plummets lest with a headlong gyre he ruins all
in these state consternations when a kingdom stands tottering at the centre out of suspicion safety grows often
let us suspect this fellow and that albeit he show us the king's hand it may be but a trick
your lordship hits a poisoned nail i'th head
this waxen fellow by the king's hand so bribing him with gold is set on screws perhaps is made his creature to turn round every way
out of that fear will i beget truth
for myself in person will sound the king's breast
that's half the prize he gapes for
i'll venture it and come off well i warrant you and rip up his very entrails cut in two his heart and search each corner in't yet shall not he know who it is cut up the anatomy
'tis an exploit worth wonder
put the worst say some infernal voice should roar from hell the infant's cloistering up
'tis not our danger nor the imprisoned prince's for what thief dares by base sacrilege rob the church of him
at worst none can be lost but this slight fellow
all build on this as on a stable cube
if we our footing keep we fetch him forth and crown him king
if up we fly i'th air we for his soul's health a broad way prepare
enter balthazar and sebastian
thou knowest where to bestow him balthazar
hide him from being discovered
would there stood a troop of moors thrusting the paws of hungry lions forth to seize this prey and this but in my hand i should do something
must i go with this black fellow uncle
yes pretty coz hence with him balthazar
sweet child within few minutes i'll change thy fate and take thee hence but set thee at heavens gate
exit balthazar and sebastian
some keep aloof and watch this soldier i'll do't
what's to be done now
first to plant strong guard about the mother then into some snare to hunt this spotted panther and there kill him
what snares have we can hold him
be that care mine
dangers like stars in dark attempts best shine
the lady onaelia dresseth the stead of her commendations in the most courtly attire that words can be clothed with from herself to you by me
so sir and what disease troubles her now
and here she hath sent something to you wrapped up in a white sheet you need not fear to open it 'tis no course
a letter minced into five morsels
what was she doing when thou camest from her
at her prick song
so me thinks for here's nothing but sol re me fa mi
what crotchet fills her head now canst tell
no crotchets 'tis only the cliff has made her mad
what instrument played she upon
a wind instrument she did nothing but sigh
sol re me fa mi
my wit has always a singing head i have found out her note captain
re is all rent and torn like a ragamuffin
me mend it good captain
fa why farewell and be hanged
mi captain with all my heart
have i tickled my lady's fiddle well
oh but you stick wants rosin to make the strings sound clearly
no this double virginal being cunningly touched another matter of jack leaps up then is now in mine eye
sol re me fa mi i have it now
solus rex me facit miseram alas poor lady tell her no apothecary in spain has any of that assa foetida < > she writes for
a thing to be taken in a glister pipe why what ails my lady
why when she cries out solus rex me facit miseram she says in the hypocronicall language that she is so miserably tormented with the wind colic that it racks her very soul
i said somewhat cut her soul in pieces
but go to her and say the oven is heating
and what shall be baked in't
<> and besides tell her the hole in her coat shall be mended and tell her if the dial of good days goes true why then bounce buckrum
<> the devil lies sick of the mulligrubs
<> or the cony is dub'd and three sheepskins with the wrong side outward shall make the fox a night cap
so the goose talks french to the buzzard
but sir if evil days jostle our prognostication to the wall then say there's a fire in a whore masters cod piece
and a poisoned bag pudding in tom thumb's belly
the first cut be thine
would'st not trust an almanac
not a coranta neither though it were sealed with butter and yet i know where they both lie passing well
the king sends round about the court to seek you
dancing bear i'm gone
a private room exeunt king and balthazar remain i'st done
hast drawn thy two edged sword out yet
no i was striking at the two iron bars that hinder your passage and see sir
the edge abated feel
no no i see it
as blunt as ignorance
put up so how
i saw by chance hanging in cardinal alvarez gallery a picture of hell
so what of that
there lay upon burnt straw ten thousand brave fellows all stark naked some leaning upon crowns some on mitres some on bags of gold
glory in another corner lay a feather beaten in the rain
beauty was turned into a watching candle that went out stinking
ambition went upon a huge high pair of stilts but horribly rotten
some in another nook were killing kings and some having their elbows shoved forward by kings to murder others
i was me thought half in hell myself whist i stood to view this piece
was't not enough to see that a man is more healthful that eats dirty puddings than he that feeds on a corrupted conscience
a conjuring book ne'r opened without the reader's danger
'tis indeed a scarecrow set i'th world to frighten weak fools
hast thou seen fields paved o'er with carcasses now to be tender footed not to tread on a boy's mangled quarters and a woman's
nay sir i have searched the records of the low countries and find that by your pardon i need not care a pin for goblins and therefore i will do it sir
i did recoil because i was double charged
here comes a satyr with sharp horns
enter cardinal and medina like a french doctor
sir here's a frenchman charged with some strange business which to close ear only he'll deliver or else to none
cannot he speak the spanish
si signor un poco monsieur acontez in de corner me come for offer to your bon grace mi trezhumbla service by gar no john fidleco shall put into your near braver melody dan dis un petite pipe shall play to your great bon grace

shall i a second wheel add to this mischief to set it faster going
if one break t'other may keep his motion
to give thy sword an edge again this frenchman shall whet thee on that if thy pistol fail or poniard this can send the poison home
brother cain we'll shake hands
in de bowl of de bloody busher
'tis very fine wholesome
and more to arm your resolution i'll tune this churchman so that he shall chime in sounds harmonious merit to that man whose hand has but a finger in that act
that music were worth hearing
holy father you must give pardon to me in unlocking a cave stuffed full with serpents which my state threaten to poison and it lies in you to break their bed with thunder of your voice
suppose a universal hot pestilence beat her mortiferous wings o'er all my kingdoms am i not bound in soul to empty all our academies of doctors and aesculapian spirits to charm this plague
or had the canon made a breach into our rich escurial down to beat it about our ears should i stop this breach spare even our richest ornaments nay our crown could it keep bullets off
no sir you should not
this linstock gives you fire
shall then that strumpet and bastard breathe quick vengeance in my face making my kingdom reel my subjects stagger in their obedience and yet live
shed not their bloods to gain a kingdom greater than ten times this
pish not matter how red cap and his wit run
as i am catholic king i'll have their hearts panting in these two hands
dare you turn hangman
is this religion catholic to kill what even brute beasts abhor to do your own
to cut in sunder wedlock's sacred knot tied by heaven's fingers
to make spain a bonfire to quench which must a second deluge rain in showers of blood no water
if you do this there is an arm armipotent that can fling you into a base grave and your palaces with lightening strike and of their ruins make a tomb for you unpitied and abhorred bear witness all you lamps celestial i wash my hands of this
rise my good angel whose holy tunes beat from me that evil spirit which jogs mine elbow hence thou dog of hell
bark out no more thou mastiff get you all gone and let my soul sleep
aside to balthazar there's gold peace see it done
sirra you salsa perilla rascal toads gut you whorson pockey french spawn of a butsten bellyed spider
do you hear monsieur
why do you bark and snap at my narcissus as if i were de french dog
you cur of cerberus litter strikes him you'll poison the honest lady
do but once toot into her chamber pot and i'll make thee look worse than a witch does upon a close stool
you shall not dare to touch him stood he here single before thee
i'll cut the rat into anchovies
i'll make thee kiss his hand embrace him love him and call him medina reveals his true identity
the perfection of all spaniards mars in little the best book of the art of war printed in these times
as a french doctor i would have given you pellets for pills but as my noblest lord rip my heart out in your service
thou are the truest clock that e'er to time paidst tribute honest soldier i lost mine own shape and put on a french only to try thy truth and the king's falsehood both which i find
now this great spanish volume is opened to me i read him o'er and o'er oh what black characters are printed in him
nothing but certain ruin threats your niece without prevention
well this plot was laid in such disguise to sound him they that know how to meet dangers are the less afraid
yet let me counsel you not to text down these wrongs in red lines
no i will not father
now that i have anatomised his thoughts i'll read a lecture on them that shall save many men's lives and to the kingdom minister most wholesome surgery
these letters from us in our niece's name you know treat of a marriage
there's the strong anchor to stay all in this tempest
holy sir with these works you the king and so prevail that all these mischiefs hull with flagging sail
my best in this i'll do
soldier thy breast i must lock better things in
'tis your chest with three good keys to keep it from opening an honest heart a daring hand and a pocket which scorns money
enter king cardinal with letters valesco and lopez
commend us to medina say his letters right pleasing are and that except himself nothing could be more welcome
counsel him to blot the opinion out of factious numbers only to have his ordinary train waiting upon him
for to quit all fears upon his side of us our very court shall even but dimly shine with some few dons freely to prove our longings great to peace
the constable expects some pawn from you that in this fairy circle shall rise up no fury to confound his niece nor him
a king's word is engaged
it shall be taken
valasco call the captain of our guard bid him attend us instantly
see letters from duke medina both in the name of him and all his faction offering peace and our old love his niece onaelia in marriage with her free and fair consent to cockadillio a don of spain
will you refuse this
my crown as soon
they feel their sinewy plots belike to shrink i'the joints
and fearing ruin have found this cement out to piece up all which more endangers all
lions may hunted be into the snare but if they once break loose woe be to him that first seized on them
a poor prisoner scorns to kiss his jailer
and shall a king be choked with sweet meats by false traitors
no i will fawn on them as they stroke me till they are fast but in this paw
the captain of your guard
enter alanzo the captain
upon thy life double our guard this day
let every man bear a charged pistol hid and at a watch word given by a musket when our self sees time rush in and if medina's faction wrestle against your forces kill but if yield save
i am charmed sir
if any wear a cross feather or glove or such prodigious signs of a knit faction table their names up
at our court gate plant good strength to bar them out if once they swarm
do this upon thy life
not death shall fright me
exit valasco and lopez enter balthazar
young cub's flayed but the she fox shifting her hole is fled
the little jackanapes the boy's brained
he shall ne'r speak more spanish
thou teachest me to curse thee
for a bargain you set your hand to
half my crown i'd lose were it undone
but half a crown
his brains stick in my conscience more than yours
how lost i the french doctor
as frenchmen lose their hair
here was too hot staying for him
get thou from my sight the queen would see thee
go with judas and repent
so men hate whores after lust's heat is spent
tell me true is he dead
'tis but morning of revenge the sunset shall be red and tragical
sin is a raven croaking her own fall
enter medina daenia alba carlo and the faction with rosemary in their hats
keep locked the door and let none enter to us but who shares our fortunes
what entertainment did the king bestow upon your letters and the cardinal's
with a devouring eye he read them o'er swallowing our offers into his empty bosom as gladly as the parched earth drinks healths out of the cup of heaven
little suspecting what dangers closely lie enambushed
let us not trust to that
there's in his breast both fox and lion and both these beasts can bite
we must not now behold the narrowest loop hole but presently suspect a winged bullet flies whizzing by our ears
for when i let the plummet fall to sound his very soul in his close chamber being french doctor like he to the cardinal's ear sung sorcerous notes the burden of his song to mine was death onaelia's murder and sebastian's
and think you his voice alters now
'tis strange to see how brave this tyrant shows in court throned like a god
great men are pretty stars when his rays shine wonder fills up all eyes by sight of him let him but once check sin about him round all cry oh excellent king
oh saint like man
but let this king retire into his closet to put off his robes he like a player leaves his part too
open his breast and with a sunbeam search it there's no such man
this king of gilded clay within is ugliness lust treachery and a base soul though reared colossus like
balthazar beats to come
none till he speaks and that we know his voice
within an honest house keeper in rosemary lane too if you dwell in the same parish
oh 'tis our honest soldier give him entrance
men show like coarses for i meet few but are stuck with rosemary
every one asked me who was married today and i told them adultery and repentance and that shame and a hangman followed them to church
there's but two parts to play shame has done hers but execution must close up the scene and for that cause these sprigs are worn by all bags of marriage now of funeral for death this day turns courtier
who must dance with him
the king and all that are our opposites
that dart or this must fly into the court either to shoot this blazing star from spain or else so long to wrap him up in clouds till all the fatal fires in him burn out leaving his state and conscience clear from doubt of following uproars
kill not but surprise him
that's my voice still
oh this colic of a kingdom when the wind of treason gets amongst the small guts what a rumbling and a roaring it keeps
and yet make the best of it you can it goes on stinking
if men should pull the sun out of heaven every time 'tis eclipsed not all the wax nor tallow in spain would serve to make us candles for one year
no way to purge the sick state but by opening a vein
is that your french physic
if every one of us should be whipped according to our faults to be lashed at a cart's tail would be held but a flea biting
whispers what are you
come from the king
i know him let him enter
signor i thank your kind intelligence the news long since was sent into our ears yet we embrace your love so fare you well
will you smell to a sprig of rosemary
will you be hanged
this is either signor no or no signor
he makes his love to us a warning piece to arm ourselves against we come to court because the guard is doubled
tush we care not
if any here arms his hand to cut off the head let him first pluck out my throat
in any noble act i'll wade chin deep with you
but to kill a king
you were better my lord sail five hundred times to bantam in the west indies that once to barathrum in the low countries
it's hot going under the line there the calenture of the soul is a most miserable madness
turn then this wheel of fate from shedding blood till with her own hand justice weighs all
must then his trul be once more sphered in court to triumph in my spoils in my eclipses
and i like moping juno sit whilst jove varies his lust into five hundred shapes to steal to his whore's bed
no malateste italian fires of jealousy burn my marrow
for to delude my hopes the lecherous king cuts out this robe of cunning marriage to cover his incontinence which flames hot as my fury in his black desires
i am swollen big with child of vengeance now and till delivered feel the throws of hell
just is your imagination high and noble and the brave heat of a true florentine for spain trumpets abroad her interest in the king's heart and with a black coal draws on every wall your scoffed at injuries as one that has the refuse of her sheets and the sick autumn of the weakened king where she drunk pleasures up in the full spring
that malateste that that torrent wracks me
but hymen's torch held downward shall drop out and for it the mad furies swing their brands about the bride chamber
the priest that joins them our twin born malediction
loud it may speak
the herbs and flowers to strew the wedding way be cypress eugh cold colliquintida
herbane and poppy and that magical weed which hags at midnight watch to catch the seed
to these our execrations and what mischief hell can but hatch in a distracted brain i'll be the executioner though it look so horrid it can fright even murder back
poison his whore today for thou shalt wait on the king's cup and when heated with wine he calls to drink the bride's health marry her alive to a gaping grave
when she being guarded round about with friends like a fairy land hemmed with rocks and seas what rescue shall i find
stood all the pyrenean hills that part spain and our country on each others shoulders burning with aetnean flame yet thou should'st on as being my steel of resolution first striking sparkles from my flinty breast
wert thou to catch the horses of the sun fast by their bridles and to turn back day would'st thou not do it base coward to make way to the italians second bliss revenge
were my bones threatened to the wheel of torture i'll do it
a raven's voice and it likes me well
the king expects your presence
so so we come
to turn this bride's day to a day of doom
a banquet set out cornets sounding enter at one door lopez valasco alanzo no
after them king cardinal with don cockadillio bridegroom queen and malateste after
at the other door alba carlo roderigo medina and daenia leading onaelia as bride cornego and juanna after balthazar alone
the bride and bridegroom kiss and by the cardinal are joined hand in hand
the king is very merry hugging medina very lovingly
for half spain's weigh in ingots i'd not lose this little man today
not for so much twice told sir would i miss your kingly presence
mine eyes have lost the acquaintance of your face so long and i so little late read o'er that index of the royal book your mind that scarce without your comment can i tell when in those leaves you turn o'er smiles or frowns
'tis dimness of your sight no fault i'the letter
medina you shall find that free from erratas and for a proof if i could breathe my heart in welcome forth this hall should ring naught else
welcome medina good marquis daenia dons of spain all welcome
my dearest love and queen be it your place to entertain the bride and do her grace
with all the love i can whose fire is such to give her heat i cannot burn too much
contracted bride and bridegroom sit sweet flowers not plucked in season lose their scent so will our pleasures
father cardinal methinks this morning new begins our reign
peace had her sabbath ne'r till now in spain
where is our noble soldier balthazar
so close in conference with that signor
what think'st thou of this great day balthazar
why as of a new play if it ends well all's well
all but men are but actors now if you being the king should be out of your part or the queen out of hers or your dons out if theirs here's no will never be out of his
'twere a lamentable piece of stuff to see great statesmen have vile exits but i hope there are nothing but plaudities in all your eyes
mine i protest are free
and mine by heaven
aside free from one good look till the blow be given
a full cup crowned to medina's health
your highness this day so much honours me that i to pay you what i truly owe my life shall venture for it
onaelia you are sad
why frowns your brow
a foolish memory of my past ills folds up my look in furrows of old care but my heart's merry sir
which mirth to heighten your bridegroom and yourself first pledge this health which we begin to our high constable
three cups filled one to the king the second to the bridegroom and the third to onaelia with whom the king compliments
as all our spanish figs are
here's to medina's heart with all my heart
my heart shall pledge your heart i'th deepest draught that ever spaniard drank
medina mocks me because i wrong her with the largest bowl
i'll change with thee onaelia
sir you shall not
fear you i cannot fetch it off
this is your scorn to her because i am doing this poorest honour to her
music sound it goes were it ten fathoms to the ground
king drinks queen and malateste storm
fate strikes with the wrong weapon
sweet royal sir no more it is too deep
twill hurt your health sir
interrupt me in my drink
you have drunk your last that poisoned bowl i filled not to be put in your hand but hers
descend black speckled soul to hell
the faction turn on malateste and wound him
the queen has sent me thither
what new fury shakes now with her snake's locks
i i 'tis i whose soul is torn in pieces till i send this harlot home
let the constable make a mittimus keep them asunder
how is it royal son
i feel no poison yet only mine eyes are putting out their lights
me thinks i feel death's icy fingers stroking down my face
and now i'm in a mortal cold sweat
hence call in my physicians
thy physician tyrant dwells yonder call on him or none
bloody medina stab'st thou brutus too
as he is so are we all
i burn my brains boil in a cauldron oh one drop of water now to cool me
oh let him have physicians
physicians for my soul i need none else
you'll not deny me those
oh holy father is there no mercy hovering in a cloud for me a miserable king so drenched in perjury and murder
oh sir great store
come down come quickly down
i'll forthwith send for a grave friar to be your confessor
and he shall cure your wounded soul
fetch him good soldier
so good a work i'll hasten
oh she's drowned in tears
onaelia let me not die unpardoned at thy hands
enter balthazar sebastian as a friar with others
here comes a better surgeon
hail my good son i come to be thy ghostly father
'tis my sebastian or some spirit sent in his shape to fright me
'tis no goblin sir feel
your own flesh and blood and much younger than you though he be bald and calls you son
had i been as ready to have cut his sheep's throat as you were to send him to the shambles he had bleated no more
there's less chalk upon your score of sins by these round o'es oh my dull soul look up thou art somewhat lighter
noble medina see sebastian lives
onaelia cease to weep sebastian lives
fetch me my crown
my sweetest pretty friar can my hands do't i'll raise thee one step higher
thou'st been in heaven's house all this while sweet boy
i had but coarse cheer
thou could'st n'er fare better
religious houses are those hives where bees make honey for men's souls
i tell thee boy a friary is a cube which strongly stands fashioned by men supported by heaven's hands
orders of holy priesthood are as high i'th eyes of angels as a king's dignity
both these unto a crown give the full weight and both are thine
you that our contract know see how i seal it with this marriage
my blessing and spain's kingdom both be thine
doff that friar's coarse grey
and since he's crowned a king clothe him like one
those are right sovereign ornaments
had i been clothed so i had never filled spain's chronicle with my black calumny
my work is almost finished
here piecemeal torn by furies
your hand paulina too onaelia yours
this hand the pledge of my twice broken faith by you usurped is her inheritance
my love is turned see as my fate is turned thus they today laugh yesterday which mourned
i pardon thee my death
let her be sent back into florence with a trebled dowry
death comes oh now i see what late i feared
a contract broke though pieced up ne'r so well heaven sees earth suffers but it ends in hell
oh i could die with him
since the bright sphere i moved in falls alas what make i here
the hammers of black mischief now cease beating yet some irons still are heating
you sir bridegroom set all this while up as a mark to shoot at we here discharge you of your bedfellow she loves no barber's washing my balls are saved then
be it your charge so please you reverend sir to see the late queen safely to florence
my niece onaelia and that trusty soldier we do appoint to guard the infant king
other distractions time must reconcile
the state is poisoned like a crocodile
