world i was once resolu’d to bee round with thee because i know tis thy fashion to bee round with euery bodie but the winde shifting his point the veine turn’d yet because thou wilt sit as judge of all matters though for thy labour thou wear’st midasses eares and art monstrum horrendum informe ingens cui lumen ademptum whose great poliphemian eye is put out i care not much if i make description before thy vniuersality of that terrible poetomachia lately commenc’d betweene horace the second and a band of leane witted poetasters
they haue bin at high wordes and so high that the ground could not serue them but for want of chopins haue stalk’t vpon stages
horace hal’d his poetasters to the barre the poetasters vntruss’d horace how worthily eyther or how wrongfully world leaue it to the jurie horace questionles made himselfe beleeue that his burgonian wit might desperately challenge all commers and that none durst take vp the foyles against him it’s likely
if he had not so beleiu’d he had not bin so deceiu’d for hee was answer’d at his owne weapon and if before apollo himselfe who is coronator poetarum an inquisition should be taken touching this lamentable merry murdering of innocent poetry all mount helicon to bun hill it would be found on the poetasters side se defendendo
notwithstanding the doctors thinke otherwise
i meete one and he runnes full butt at me with his satires hornes for that in vntrussing horace i did onely whip his fortunes and condition of life where the more noble reprehension had bin of his mindes narrow eyes obseru’d in himselfe as it did little spots vpon others without all disputation horace would not haue left horace out of euery man in’s hvmour
why does not he taxe that onely in others
read his arraignement and see
a second cat a mountaine mewes and calles me barren because my braines could bring foorth no other stigmaticke than tucca whome horace had put to making and begot to my hand but i wonder what language tucca would haue spoke if honest capten hannam had bin borne without a tongue
ist not as lawfull then for mee to imitate horace as horace hannam
fellow of what test so euer hee had bin out fac’d and out weyed by a settled former approbation neyther was it much improper to set the same dog vpon horace whom horace had set to worrie others
i could heere eeuen with the feather of my pen wipe off other ridiculous imputations but my best way to answer them is to laugh at them onely thus much i protest and sweare by the diuinest part of true poesie that howsoeuer the limmes of my naked lines may bee and i know haue bin tortur’d on the racke they are free from conspiring the least disgrace to any man but onely to our new horace neyther should this ghost of tucca haue walkt vp and downe poules church yard but that hee was raiz’d vp in print by newe exorcismes
world if thy hugenes will beleiue this doe if not i care not for i dedicate my booke not to thy greatnes but to the greatnes of thy scorne defying which let that mad dog detraction bite till his teeth bee worne to the stumps enuy feede thy snakes so fat with poyson till they burst world let all thy adders shoote out their hidra headed forked stinges ha ha nauci if none will take my part as i desire none yet i thanke thee thou true venusian horace for these good wordes thou giu’st me populus me sibylat at mihi plaudo

bubo they must presse more valiant wits than theyr own to do it me ath stage
ile starue their poore copper lace workmasters that dare play me i can bring & that they quake at a prepar’d troope of gallants who for my sake shal distaste euery vnsalted line in their fly blowne comedies
nay that’s certaine ile bring
gallants of my ranke
that same crispinus is the silliest dor and faninus the slightest cob web lawne peece of a poet oh god
why should i care what euery dor doth buz in credulous eares it is a crowne to me that the best iudgements can report me wrong’d
i am one of them that can report it
i thinke but what they are and am not moou’d
the one a light voluptuous reueler the other a strange arrogating puffe both impudent and arrogant enough
s’lid do not criticus reuel in these lynes ha ningle ha

asinius reads and takes tabacco
to see my fate that when i dip my pen in distilde roses and doe striue to dreine out of myne inke all gall that when i wey each sillable i write or speake because mine enemies with sharpe and searching eyes looke through & through me caruing my poore labours like an anotomy oh heauens to see that when my lines are measur’d out as straight as euen paralels tis strange that still still some imagine they are drawne awry
the error is not mine but in theyr eye that cannot take proportions
horrace horrace to stand within the shot of galling tongues proues not your gilt for could we write on paper made of these turning leaues of heauen the cloudes or speake with angels tongues yet wise men know that some would shake the head tho saints should sing some snakes must hisse because they’re borne with stings
doe we not see fooles laugh at heauen
and mocke the makers workmanship be not you grieu’d if that which you molde faire vpright and smooth be skrwed awry made crooked lame and vile by racking coments and calumnious tongues so to be bit it rankcles not for innocence may with a feather brush off the foulest wrongs
but when your dastard wit will strike at men in corners and in riddles folde the vices of your best friends you must not take to heart if they take off all gilding from their pilles and onely offer you the bitter coare
say that you haue not sworne vnto your paper to blot her white cheekes with the dregs and bottome of your friends priuate vices say you sweare your loue and your aleageance to bright vertue makes you descend so low as to put on the office of an executioner onely to strike off the swolne head of sinne where ere you finde it standing say you sweare and make damnation parcell of your oath that when your lashing iestes make all men bleed yet you whip none
court citty country friends foes all must smart alike yet court nor citty nor foe nor friend dare winch at you great pitty
if you sweare dam me faninus or crispinus or to the law our kingdomes golden chaine to poets dam me or to players dam me if i brand you or you tax you scourge you i wonder then that of fiue hundred foure should all point with their fingers in one instant at one and the same man

i say sir vaughan no shinne shal be broken heer what lungis a chayre with a stronge backe and a soft bellie great with childe with a cushion for this reuerend lady
god neuer gaue me the grace to be a lady yet i ha beene worshipt in my conscience to my face a thousand times i cannot denye sir vaughan but that i haue all implements belonging to the vocation of a lady
i trust mistris mineuer you haue all a honest oman shud haue
serue my turne and other things which ide bee loath euery one should see because they shal not be common i am in manner of a lady in one point
i pray mistris mineuers let vs all see that point for mi

and much good do’t thy good heart faire widdow with them
i am fayre enough to bee a widdow sir quintilian

no i thinke if loue should bee turn’d away and goe to serue any beast it must bee an ape and my reason sir vaugh
sir adam an ape
ther’s no more reason in an ape than in a very plaine monkey for an ape has no tayle but we all know or tis our duty to know loue has two tailes in my sudsment if loue be a beast that beast is a bunce of reddis for a bunce of reddis is wise meate without mutton and so is loue
such a sore mouth would one day needes perswade me that loue was a rebato and his reason was sauing your reuerence that a rebato was worne out with pinning too often and so he said loue was

my interpretations is that almost all are welcome because i indited a brace or two more that is not come i am sorrie my ladie pride is not among you
slid he makes hounds of vs ningle a brace quoth a
peter salamanders draw out the pictures of all the ioynt stooles & ladies sit downe vpon their wodden faces
master horace master horace when i pray to god and desire in hipocritnes that bald sir adams were heer then then then begin to make your railes at the pouertie and beggerly want of haire
bubo sit there you and i wil thinke vpon our ends at the tables horace put your learned bodie into the midst of these ladies so tis no matter to speake graces at nuncions because we are all past grace since dinner
this hand full of carrawaies i could neuer abide to say grace
mistris miniuer is not that innocent gentleman a kinde of foole
why doe you aske madam
i thinke he’s within an inch of a foole
madam philocalia you sit next that spare gentleman wod you heard what mistris miniuer saies of you
nay nothing but wishes you were married to that small timber’d gallant
your wish and mine are twinnes i wish so too for then i should be sure to lead a merrie life
then should be soone shot by these comfits weed let all slide
he takes the sweetest oathes that euer i heard a gallant of his pitch sweare by these comfits & these carrawaies i warrant it does him good to sweare
yes faith tis meate and drinke to me
i am glad ladie petula by this apple that they please you
peter salamanders wine i beseech you master asinius bubo not to sweare so deeplie for there comes no fruite of your oathes heere ladies i put you all into one corners together you shall all drinke of one cup
peter i prethee fill me out too
ide fling you out too and i might ha my will a pox of all fooles
mistris miniuers pray bee lustie wod sir adams prickshaft stucke by you
who the balde knight sir vaughan
the same horace he that has but a remnant or parcell of haire his crowne is clipt and par’d away me thinkes tis an excellent quallitie to bee balde for and there stucke a nose and two nyes in his pate he might weare two faces vnder one hood
as god saue me la if i might ha my will ide rather be a balde gentleman then a hairy for i am sure the best and tallest yeomen in england haue balde heads me thinkes haire is a scuruie lowsie commodity
bubo heerein you blaze your ignorance
pray stop and fill your mouthes and giue horace all your eares
for if of all the bodies parts the head be the most royall if discourse wit iudgement and all our vnderstanding faculties sit there in their high court of parliament enacting lawes to sway this humorous world this little ile of man needes must that crowne which stands vpon this supreame head be faire and helde inualuable and that crowne’s the haire the head that wants this honour stands awry is bare in name and in authority
he meanes balde pates mistris miniuers
haire tis the roabe which curious nature weaues to hang vpon the head and does adorne our bodies in the first houre we are borne god does bestow that garment when we dye that like a soft and silken canopie is still spred ouer vs in spight of death our hayre growes in our graue and that alone lookes fresh when all our other beauty’s gone
the excellence of haire in this shines cleere that the foure elements take pride to weare the fashion of it when fire most bright does burne the flames to golden lockes doe striue to turne when her lasciuious armes the water hurles about the shoares wast her sleeke head she curles and rorid cloudes being suckt into the ayre when downe they melt hangs like fine siluer hayre
you see the earth whose head so oft is shorne frighted to feele her lockes so rudely torne stands with her haire an end and thus afraide turnes euery haire to a greene naked blade
besides when strucke with griefe we long to dye we spoile that most which most does beautifie we rend this head tyre off
i thus conclude cullors set cullors out our eyes iudge right of vice or vertue by their opposite so if faire haire to beauty ad such grace baldnes must needes be vgly vile and base
true horace for a bald reason is a reason that has no haires vpon’t a scuruy scalded reason
by my truely i neuer thought you could ha pickt such strange things out of haire before
nay my ningle can tickle it when hee comes too’t
troth i shall neuer bee enameld of a bare headed man for this what shift so euer i make
then mistris miniuer adams prickshaft must not hit you peter take vp all the cloathes at the table and the plums
enter tucca and his boy
saue thee my little worshipfull harper how doe yee my little cracknels
no godamercy cadwallader how doe you horace

welcome red cheekt ladies and welcome comely widdow gentlemen now that our sorry banquet is put by from stealing more sweet kisses from your lips walke in my garden ladyes let your eyes shed life into these flowers by their bright beames sit sit heere’s a large bower heere all may heare now good crispinus let your praize begin there where it left off baldnes
i shall winne no praise by praising that which to depraue all tongues are readie and which none would haue
to prooue that best by strong and armed reason whose part reason feares to take cannot but prooue your wit’s fine temper and from these win loue
i promise you has almost conuerted me i pray bring forward your bald reasons poet
mistris you giue my reasons proper names for arguments like children should be like the subiect that begets them i must striue to crowne bald heades therefore must baldlie thriue but be it as it can to what before went arm’d at table this force bring i more if a bare head being like a dead mans scull should beare vp no praise els but this it sets our end before our eyes should i dispaire from giuing baldnes higher place then haire
nay perdie haire has the higher place
the goodliest & most glorious strange built wonder which that great architect hath made is heauen for there he keepes his court it is his kingdome that’s his best master piece yet tis the roofe and seeling of the world that may be cal’d the head or crowne of earth and yet that’s balde all creatures in it balde the louely sunne has a face sleeke as golde the full cheekt moone as bright and smooth as siluer nothing there weares dangling lockes but sometime blazing starres whose flaming curles set realmes on fire with warres
descend more low looke through mans fiue folde sence of all the eye beares greatest eminence and yet that’s balde the haires that like a lace are sticht vnto the liddes borrow those formes like pent houses to saue the eyes from stormes
a head and face ore growne with shaggie drosse o tis an orient pearle hid all in mosse but when the head’s all naked and vncrown’d it is the worlds globe euen smooth and round baldnes is natures but at which our life shootes her last arrow what man euer lead his age out with a staffe but had a head bare and vncouer’d
hee whose yeares doe rise to their full height yet not balde is not wise
the head is wisedomes house haire but the thatch haire
it’s the basest stubble in scorne of it this prouerbe sprung he has more haire then wit marke you not in derision how we call a head growne thicke with haire bush naturall
by your leaue master poet but that bush naturall is one a the trimmest and most intanglingst beautie in a woman
right but beleeue this pardon me most faire you would haue much more wit had you lesse haire i could more wearie you to tell the proofes as they passe by which fight on baldnes side then were you taskt to number on a head the haires i know not how your thoughts are lead on this strong tower shall my opinion rest heades thicke of haire are goode but balde the best
whilst this paradox is in speaking tucca enters with sir vaughan at one doore and secretly placeth him then exit and brings in horace muffled placing him tucca sits among them
th’art within a haire of it my sweete wit whether wilt thou
sir vaughan steps out
by your fauour master tucky his balde reasons are wide aboue two hayres i besees you pardon mee ladies that i thrust in so malepartly among you for i did but mych heere and see how this cruell poet did handle bald heades
he gaue them but their due sir vaughan widdow did he not
by my faith he made more of a balde head than euer i shall be able he gaue them their due truely
haire as i am and that was not in his fingers to giue but in god a mighties well i will hyre that humorous and fantasticall poet master horace to breake your balde pate sir adam
breake my balde pate
patience captaine tucky let me absolue him i meane he shal pricke pricke your head or sconce a little with his goose quils for he shal make another thalimum or crosse stickes or some polinoddyes with a fewe nappy grams in them that shall lift vp haire and set it an end with his learned and harty commendations
this is excellent all will come out now
that same horace me thinkes has the most vngodly face by my fan it lookes for all the world like a rotten russet apple when tis bruiz’d its better then a spoonefull of sinamon water next my heart for me to heare him speake hee soundes it so i’ th nose and talkes and randes for all the world like the poore fellow vnder ludgate oh fye vpon him

enter terrill and cælestine sadly sir quintilian stirring and mingling a cup of wine
o night that dyes the firmament in blacke and like a cloth of cloudes doth stretch thy limbes vpon the windy tenters of the ayre o thou that hang’st vpon the backe of day like a long mourning gowne thou that art made without an eye because thou shouldst not see a louers reuels nor participate the bride groomes heauen ô heauen to me a hell i haue a hell in heauen a blessed cursse all other brides groomes long for night and taxe the day of lazie slouth call time a cripple and say the houres limpe after him but i wish night for euer banisht from the skie or that the day would neuer sleepe or time were in a swound and all his little houres could neuer lift him vp with their poore powers
but backward runnes the course of my delight the day hath turn’d his backe and it is night this night will make vs odde day made vs eeuen all else are damb’d in hel but i in heauen
let loose thy oath so shall we still be eeuen
then am i damb’d in hell and not in heauen
must i then goe

that word is thine i shall is thy commaund i goe because i shall will i then goe
i aske my selfe ô ill king saies i must you i shall i i will
had i not sworne
why didst thou sweare
the king sat heauvy on my resolution till out of breath it panted out an oath
why what’s an oath
tis but the smoake of flame & bloud the blister of the spirit which rizeth from the steame of rage the bubble that shootes vp to the tongue and scaldes the voice for oathes are burning words thou swor’st but one tis frozen long agoe if one be numbred what countrimen are they
where doe they dwell that speake naught else but oathes
they’re men of hell
why tis the trafficke of the soule tis law within a man the seale of faith the bond of euery conscience vnto whom we set our thoughts like hands yea such a one i swore and to the king a king containes a thousand thousand when i swore to him i swore to them the very haires that guard his head will rise vp like sharpe witnesses against my faith and loyalty his eye would straight condemne me argue oathes no more my oath is high for to the king i swore
enter sir quintilian with the cup
must i betray my chastity
so long cleane from the treason of rebelling lust o husband
if poore i must not liue chast then let me chastly dye
i heer’s a charme shall keep thee chaste come come olde time hath left vs but an houre to play our parts begin the sceane who shall speake first
oh i i play the king and kings speake first daughter stand thou heere thou sonne terrill there o thou standst well thou lean’st against a poast for thou’t be posted off i warrant thee the king will hang a horne about thy necke and make a poast of thee you stand well both we neede no prologue the king entring first he’s a most gracious prologue mary then for the catastrophe or epilogue ther’s one in cloth of siluer which no doubt will please the hearers well when he steps out his mouth is fil’d with words see where he stands he’ll make them clap their eyes besides their hands
but to my part suppose who enters now a king whose eyes are set in siluer one that blusheth golde speakes musicke dancing walkes now gathers neerer takes thee by the hand when straight thou thinkst the very orbe of heauen mooues round about thy fingers then he speakes thus thus i know not how
nor i to answer him
knowst thou not how to answer him
why then the field is lost and he rides home like a great conquerour not answer him
out of thy part already
yes yes true chastity is tongu’d so weake tis ouer come ere it know how to speake
come come thou happy close of euery wrong tis thou that canst dissolue the hardest doubt tis time for thee to speake we are all out
daughter and you the man whom i call sonne i must confesse i made a deede of gift to heauen and you and gaue my childe to both when on my blessing i did charme her soule in the white circle of true chastity still to run true till death now sir if not she forfeyts my rich blessing and is fin’d with an eternall cursse then i tell you she shall dye now now whilst her soule is true
i i am deaths eccho
o my sonne i am her father euery teare i shed is threescore ten yeere olde i weepe and smile two kinde of teares i weepe that she must dye i smile that she must dye a virgin thus we ioyfull men mocke teares and teares mocke vs
what speakes that cup
white wine and poison
oh that very name of poison poisons me thou winter of a man thou walking graue whose life is like a dying taper how canst thou define a louers labouring thoughts
what sent hast thou but death
what taste but earth
the breath that purles from thee is like the steame of a new open’d vault i know thy drift because thou art trauelling to the land of graues thou couetst company and hether bringst a health of poison to pledge death a poison for this sweete spring this element is mine this is the ayre i breath corrupt it not this heauen is mine i bought it with my soule of him that selles a heauen to buy a soule
well let her goe she’s thine thou cal’st her thine thy element the ayre thou breath’st thou knowst the ayre thou breath’st is common make her so perhaps thou’t say none but the king shall weare thy night gowne she that laps thee warme with loue and that kings are not common then to shew by consequence he cannot make her so indeede she may promoote her shame and thine and with your shames speake a good word for mine the king shining so cleare and we so dim our darke disgraces will be seene through him
imagine her the cup of thy moist life what man would pledge a king in his owne wife
she dyes that sentence poisons her o life
what slaue would pledge a king in his owne wife
welcome ô poyson phisicke against lust thou holesome medicine to a constant bloud thou rare apothecary that canst keepe my chastity preseru’d within this boxe of tempting dust this painted earthen pot that stands vpon the stall of the white soule to set the shop out like a flatterer to draw the customers of sinne come come thou art no poison but a dyet drinke to moderate my bloud white innocent wine art thou made guilty of my death
oh no for thou thy selfe art poison’d take me hence for innocence shall murder innocence
