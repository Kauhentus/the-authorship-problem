fortune that favours fools these two short hours we wish away both for your sakes and ours judging spectators and desire in place to the author justice to ourselves but grace
our scene is london 'cause we would make known no country's mirth is better than our own no clime breeds better matter for your whore bawd squire impostor many persons more whose manners now call'd humours feed the stage and which have still been subject for the rage or spleen of comic writers
though this pen did never aim to grieve but better men howe'er the age he lives in doth endure the vices that she breeds above their cure
but when the wholesome remedies are sweet and in their working gain and profit meet he hopes to find no spirit so much diseased but will with such fair correctives be pleased for here he doth not fear who can apply
if there be any that will sit so nigh unto the stream to look what it doth run they shall find things they'd think or wish were done they are so natural follies but so shewn as even the doers may see and yet not own
a a a believe 't i will
i fart at thee
have you your wits
for love sirrah i'll strip you what to do
lick figs out at my rogue rogue
out of all your sleights
nay look ye sovereign general are you madmen
o let the wild sheep loose
i'll gum your silks with good strong water an you come
will you have the neighbours hear you

you most notorious whelp you insolent slave dare you do this
yes faith yes faith

who am i'll tell you
since you know not yourself
yes you were once time's not long past the good honest plain livery three pound thrum that kept your master's worship's house here in the friars for the vacations will you be so loud
since by my means translated suburb captain
by your means doctor dog
within man's memory all this i speak of
why i pray you have i been countenanced by you or you by me
do but collect sir where i met you first
i do not hear well
not of this i think it
but i shall put you in mind sir at pie corner taking your meal of steam in from cooks' stalls where like the father of hunger you did walk piteously costive with your pinch'd horn nose and your complexion of the roman wash stuck full of black and melancholic worms like powder corns shot at the artillery yard
i wish you could advance your voice a little
when you went pinn'd up in the several rags you had raked and pick'd from dunghills before day your feet in mouldy slippers for your kibes a felt of rug and a thin threaden cloke that scarce would cover your no buttocks so sir
when all your alchemy and your algebra your minerals vegetals and animals your conjuring cozening and your dozen of trades could not relieve your corps with so much linen would make you tinder but to see a fire i gave you countenance credit for your coals your stills your glasses your materials built you a furnace drew you customers advanced all your black arts lent you beside a house to practise in your master's house
where you have studied the more thriving skill of bawdry since
yes in your master's house
you and the rats here kept possession
make it not strange
i know you were one could keep the buttery hatch still lock'd and save the chippings sell the dole beer to aqua vitae men the which together with your christmas vails at post and pair your letting out of counters made you a pretty stock some twenty marks and gave you credit to converse with cobwebs here since your mistress' death hath broke up house
you might talk softlier rascal
no you scarab i'll thunder you in pieces i will teach you how to beware to tempt a fury again that carries tempest in his hand and voice
the place has made you valiant
thou vermin have i ta'en thee out of dung so poor so wretched when no living thing would keep thee company but a spider or worse
rais'd thee from brooms and dust and watering pots sublimed thee and exalted thee and fix'd thee in the third region call'd our state of grace
wrought thee to spirit to quintessence with pains would twice have won me the philosopher's work
put thee in words and fashion made thee fit for more than ordinary fellowships
giv'n thee thy oaths thy quarrelling dimensions thy rules to cheat at horse race cock pit cards dice or whatever gallant tincture else
made thee a second in mine own great art
and have i this for thanks
do you rebel do you fly out in the projection
would you be gone now
gentlemen what mean you
will you mar all
slave thou hadst had no name will you undo yourselves with civil war
never been known past equi clibanum the heat of horse dung under ground in cellars or an ale house darker than deaf john's been lost to all mankind but laundresses and tapsters had not i been
do you know who hears you sovereign
sirrah nay general i thought you were civil
i shall turn desperate if you grow thus loud
and hang thyself i care not
hang thee collier and all thy pots and pans in picture i will since thou hast moved me o this will o'erthrow all
write thee up bawd in paul's have all thy tricks of cozening with a hollow cole dust scrapings searching for things lost with a sieve and sheers erecting figures in your rows of houses and taking in of shadows with a glass told in red letters and a face cut for thee worse than gamaliel ratsey's
have you your senses masters
i will have a book but barely reckoning thy impostures shall prove a true philosopher's stone to printers
away you trencher rascal
out you dog leech
the vomit of all prisons will you be your own destructions gentlemen
still spew'd out for lying too heavy on the basket
we are ruin'd lost
have you no more regard to your reputations
'slight have yet some care of me of your republic away this brach
i'll bring thee rogue within the statute of sorcery tricesimo tertio of harry the eighth ay and perhaps thy neck within a noose for laundring gold and barbing it
you'll bring your head within a cockscomb will you
and you sir with your menstrue gather it up
'sdeath you abominable pair of stinkards leave off your barking and grow one again or by the light that shines i'll cut your throats
i'll not be made a prey unto the marshal for ne'er a snarling dog bolt of you both
have you together cozen'd all this while and all the world and shall it now be said you've made most courteous shift to cozen yourselves
you will accuse him
you will "bring him in within the statute
" who shall take your word
a whoreson upstart apocryphal captain whom not a puritan in blackfriars will trust so much as for a feather and you too will give the cause forsooth
you will insult and claim a primacy in the divisions
you must be chief
as if you only had the powder to project with and the work were not begun out of equality
all things in common
you perpetual curs fall to your couples again and cozen kindly and heartily and lovingly as you should and lose not the beginning of a term or by this hand i shall grow factious too and take my part and quit you
'tis his fault he ever murmurs and objects his pains and says the weight of all lies upon him
why so it does
do not we sustain our parts
yes but they are not equal
why if your part exceed to day i hope ours may to morrow match it
ay they may murmuring mastiff
help me to throttle him
'ods precious i'll do any thing
what do you mean
because o' your fermentation and cibation
not i by heaven your sol and luna help me
would i were hang'd then
do so then and quickly swear
what should i swear
to leave your faction sir and labour kindly in the common work
let me not breathe if i meant aught beside
i only used those speeches as a spur to him
i hope we need no spurs sir
'slid prove to day who shall shark best
yes and work close and friendly
'slight the knot shall grow the stronger for this breach with me
why so my good baboons
shall we go make a sort of sober scurvy precise neighbours that scarce have smiled twice since the king came in a feast of laughter at our follies
rascals would run themselves from breath to see me ride or you t' have but a hole to thrust your heads in for which you should pay ear rent
and may don provost ride a feasting long in his old velvet jerkin and stain'd scarfs my noble sovereign and worthy general ere we contribute a new crewel garter to his most worsted worship
spoken like claridiana and thyself
for which at supper thou shalt sit in triumph and not be styled dol common but dol proper dol singular the longest cut at night shall draw thee for his doll particular
to the window dol pray heaven the master do not trouble us this quarter
o fear not him
while there dies one a week the plague he's safe from thinking toward london
beside he's busy at his hop yards now i had a letter from him
if he do he'll send such word for airing of the house as you shall have sufficient time to quit it though we break up a fortnight 'tis no matter
who is it dol
a fine young quodling
o my lawyer's clerk i lighted on last night in holborn at the dagger
he would have i told you of him a familiar to rifle with at horses and win cups
o let him in
get you your robes on i will meet him as going out
and what shall i do
not be seen away
seem you very reserv'd
god be wi' you sir i pray you let him know that i was here his name is dapper
i would gladly have staid but captain i am here
he's come i think doctor
good faith sir i was going away
in truth i am very sorry captain
but i thought sure i should meet you
ay i am very glad
i had a scurvy writ or two to make and i had lent my watch last night to one that dines to day at the sheriff's and so was robb'd of my past time
is this the cunning man
this is his worship
is he a doctor
and have you broke with him captain
faith he does make the matter sir so dainty i know not what to say
not so good captain
would i were fairly rid of it believe me
nay now you grieve me sir
why should you wish so
i dare assure you i'll not be ungrateful
i cannot think you will sir
but the law is such a thing and then he says read's matter falling so lately
he was an ass and dealt sir with a fool
it was a clerk sir
nay hear me sir
you know the law better i think i should sir and the danger you know i shewed the statute to you
and will i tell then
by this hand of flesh would it might never write good court hand more if i discover
what do you think of me that i am a chiaus
the turk was here
as one would say do you think i am a turk
i'll tell the doctor so
do good sweet captain
come noble doctor pray thee let's prevail this is the gentleman and he is no chiaus
captain i have return'd you all my answer
i would do much sir for your love but this i neither may nor can
tut do not say so
you deal now with a noble fellow doctor one that will thank you richly and he is no chiaus let that sir move you
pray you forbear he has four angels here
you do me wrong good sir
to tempt you with these spirits
to tempt my art and love sir to my peril
fore heaven i scarce can think you are my friend that so would draw me to apparent danger
a horse draw you and a halter you and your flies together nay good captain
that know no difference of men
good deeds sir doctor dogs meat
'slight i bring you no cheating clim o' the cloughs or claribels that look as big as five and fifty and flush and spit out secrets like hot custard captain
nor any melancholic under scribe shall tell the vicar but a special gentle that is the heir to forty marks a year consorts with the small poets of the time is the sole hope of his old grandmother that knows the law and writes you six fair hands is a fine clerk and has his cyphering perfect
will take his oath o' the greek testament if need be in his pocket and can court his mistress out of ovid
nay dear captain did you not tell me so
yes but i'd have you use master doctor with some more respect
hang him proud stag with his broad velvet head
but for your sake i'd choak ere i would change an article of breath with such a puckfist come let's be gone
pray you let me speak with you
his worship calls you captain
i am sorry i e'er embark'd myself in such a business
nay good sir he did call you
will he take then
first hear me not a syllable 'less you take
pray you sir upon no terms but an assumpsit
your humour must be law
why now sir talk
now i dare hear you with mine honour
so may this gentleman too
why sir no whispering
fore heaven you do not apprehend the loss you do yourself in this
marry to be so importunate for one that when he has it will undo you all he'll win up all the money in the town
yes and blow up gamester after gamester as they do crackers in a puppet play
if i do give him a familiar give you him all you play for never set him for he will have it
you are mistaken doctor
why he does ask one but for cups and horses a rifling fly none of your great familiars
yes captain i would have it for all games
i told you so
'slight that is a new business
i understood you a tame bird to fly twice in a term or so on friday nights when you had left the office for a nag of forty or fifty shillings
ay 'tis true sir but i do think now i shall leave the law and therefore why this changes quite the case
do you think that i dare move him
if you please sir all's one to him i see
i cannot with my conscience nor should you make the request methinks
no sir i mean to add consideration
why then sir i'll try
say that it were for all games doctor
i say then not a mouth shall eat for him at any ordinary but on the score that is a gaming mouth conceive me
he'll draw you all the treasure of the realm if it be set him
speak you this from art
ay sir and reason too the ground of art
he is of the only best complexion the queen of fairy loves
sir should she but see him what
do not you tell him
will he win at cards too
the spirits of dead holland living isaac you'd swear were in him such a vigorous luck as cannot be resisted
'slight he'll put six of your gallants to a cloke indeed
a strange success that some man shall be born to
he hears you man sir i'll not be ingrateful
faith i have confidence in his good nature you hear he says he will not be ingrateful
why as you please my venture follows yours
troth do it doctor think him trusty and make him
he may make us both happy in an hour win some five thousand pound and send us two on't
believe it and i will sir
and you shall sir
you have heard all
well a rare star reign'd at your birth
the doctor swears that you are nay captain you'll tell all now
allied to the queen of fairy
believe it no such matter yes and that you were born with a cawl on your head
come you know it well enough though you dissemble it
i'fac i do not you are mistaken
swear by your fac and in a thing so known unto the doctor
how shall we sir trust you in the other matter
can we ever think when you have won five or six thousand pound you'll send us shares in't by this rate
by jove sir i'll win ten thousand pound and send you half
no no he did but jest
go thank the doctor he's your friend to take it so
i thank his worship
'slight what else is thanks
will you be trivial
doctor when must he come for his familiar
shall i not have it with me
there must a world of ceremonies pass you must be bath'd and fumigated first besides the queen of fairy does not rise till it be noon
not if she danced to night
and she must bless it
did you never see her royal grace yet
your aunt of fairy
not since she kist him in the cradle captain i can resolve you that
well see her grace whate'er it cost you for a thing that i know
it will be somewhat hard to compass but however see her
you are made believe it if you can see her
her grace is a lone woman and very rich and if she take a fancy she will do strange things
see her at any hand
'slid she may hap to leave you all she has it is the doctor's fear
how will't be done then
let me alone take you no thought
do you but say to me captain i'll see her grace
"captain i'll see her grace
conduct him forth by the back way
sir against one o'clock prepare yourself till when you must be fasting only take three drops of vinegar in at your nose two at your mouth and one at either ear then bathe your fingers' ends and wash your eyes to sharpen your five senses and cry "hum" thrice and then "buz" as often and then come
can you remember this
it is but your bestowing some twenty nobles 'mong her grace's servants and put on a clean shirt you do not know what grace her grace may do you in clean linen
good wives i pray you forbear me now troth i can do you no good till afternoon what is your name say you
a seller of tobacco
free of the grocers
ay an't please you
well your business abel
this an't please your worship i am a young beginner and am building of a new shop an't like your worship just at corner of a street here is the plot on't and i would know by art sir of your worship which way i should make my door by necromancy and where my shelves and which should be for boxes and which for pots
i would be glad to thrive sir and i was wish'd to your worship by a gentleman one captain face that says you know men's planets and their good angels and their bad
i do if i do see them what
though art well met here
troth sir i was speaking just as your worship came here of your worship i pray you speak for me to master doctor
he shall do any thing
doctor do you hear
this is my friend abel an honest fellow he lets me have good tobacco and he does not sophisticate it with sack lees or oil nor washes it in muscadel and grains nor buries it in gravel under ground wrapp'd up in greasy leather or piss'd clouts but keeps it in fine lily pots that open'd smell like conserve of roses or french beans
he has his maple block his silver tongs winchester pipes and fire of juniper a neat spruce honest fellow and no goldsmith
he is a fortunate fellow that i am sure on
already sir have you found it
and in right way toward riches sir
this summer he will be of the clothing of his company and next spring call'd to the scarlet spend what he can
what and so little beard
sir you must think he may have a receipt to make hair come but he'll be wise preserve his youth and fine for't his fortune looks for him another way
'slid doctor how canst thou know this so soon
i am amused at that
by a rule captain in metoposcopy which i do work by a certain star in the forehead which you see not
your chestnut or your olive colour'd face does never fail and your long ear doth promise
i knew't by certain spots too in his teeth and on the nail of his mercurial finger
you were born upon a wednesday
the thumb in chiromancy we give venus the fore finger to jove the midst to saturn the ring to sol the least to mercury who was the lord sir of his horoscope his house of life being libra which fore shew'd he should be a merchant and should trade with balance
why this is strange
is it not honest nab
there is a ship now coming from ormus that shall yield him such a commodity of drugs this is the west and this the south
and those are your two sides
make me your door then south your broad side west and on the east side of your shop aloft write mathlai tarmiel and baraborat upon the north part rael velel thiel
they are the names of those mercurial spirits that do fright flies from boxes
and beneath your threshold bury me a load stone to draw in gallants that wear spurs the rest they'll seem to follow
that's a secret nab
and on your stall a puppet with a vice and a court fucus to call city dames you shall deal much with minerals
at home already ay i know you have arsenic vitriol sal tartar argaile alkali cinoper i know all
this fellow captain will come in time to be a great distiller and give a say i will not say directly but very fair at the philosopher's stone
why how now abel
good captain what must i give
nay i'll not counsel thee
thou hear'st what wealth he says spend what thou canst thou'rt like to come to
i would gi' him a crown
and toward such a fortune
heart thou shalt rather gi' him thy shop
no gold about thee
yes i have a portague i have kept this half year
out on thee nab
'slight there was such an offer shalt keep't no longer i'll give't him for thee
doctor nab prays your worship to drink this and swears he will appear more grateful as your skill does raise him in the world
i would entreat another favour of his worship
but to look over sir my almanack and cross out my ill days that i may neither bargain nor trust upon them
that he shall nab leave it it shall be done 'gainst afternoon
and a direction for his shelves
now nab art thou well pleased nab
'thank sir both your worships
why now you smoaky persecutor of nature
now do you see that something's to be done beside your beech coal and your corsive waters your crosslets crucibles and cucurbites
you must have stuff brought home to you to work on and yet you think i am at no expense in searching out these veins then following them then trying them out
'fore god my intelligence costs me more money than my share oft comes to in these rare works
you are pleasant sir
what says my dainty dolkin
yonder fish wife will not away
and there's your giantess the bawd of lambeth
heart i cannot speak with them
not afore night i have told them in a voice thorough the trunk like one of your familiars
but i have spied sir epicure mammon where
coming along at far end of the lane slow of his feet but earnest of his tongue to one that's with him
face go you and shift
dol you must presently make ready too
why what's the matter
o i did look for him with the sun's rising 'marvel he could sleep this is the day i am to perfect for him the magisterium our great work the stone and yield it made into his hands of which he has this month talked as he were possess'd
and now he's dealing pieces on't away
methinks i see him entering ordinaries dispensing for the pox and plaguy houses reaching his dose walking moorfields for lepers and offering citizens' wives pomander bracelets as his preservative made of the elixir searching the spittal to make old bawds young and the highways for beggars to make rich
i see no end of his labours
he will make nature asham'd of her long sleep when art who's but a step dame shall do more than she in her best love to mankind ever could if his dream lasts he'll turn the age to gold
now you set your foot on shore in novo orbe here's the rich peru and there within sir are the golden mines great solomon's ophir
he was sailing to't three years but we have reached it in ten months
this is the day wherein to all my friends i will pronounce the happy word you shall no more deal with the hollow dye or the frail card
no more be at charge of keeping the livery punk for the young heir that must seal at all hours in his shirt no more if he deny have him beaten to't as he is that brings him the commodity
no more shall thirst of satin or the covetous hunger of velvet entrails for a rude spun cloke to be display'd at madam augusta's make the sons of sword and hazard fall before the golden calf and on their knees whole nights commit idolatry with wine and trumpets or go a feasting after drum and ensign
no more of this
you shall start up young viceroys and have your punks and punketees my surly
and unto thee i speak it first where is my subtle there
sir he'll come to you by and by
that is his fire drake his lungs his zephyrus he that puffs his coals till he firk nature up in her own centre
you are not faithful sir
this night i'll change all that is metal in my house to gold and early in the morning will i send to all the plumbers and the pewterers and by their tin and lead up and to lothbury for all the copper
what and turn that too
yes and i'll purchase devonshire and cornwall and make them perfect indies
but when you see th' effects of the great medicine of which one part projected on a hundred of mercury or venus or the moon shall turn it to as many of the sun nay to a thousand so ad infinitum you will believe me
yes when i see't i will
but if my eyes do cozen me so and i giving them no occasion sure i'll have a whore shall piss them out next day
do you think i fable with you
i assure you he that has once the flower of the sun the perfect ruby which we call elixir not only can do that but by its virtue can confer honour love respect long life give safety valour yea and victory to whom he will
in eight and twenty days i'll make an old man of fourscore a child
no doubt he's that already
nay i mean restore his years renew him like an eagle to the fifth age make him get sons and daughters young giants as our philosophers have done the ancient patriarchs afore the flood but taking once a week on a knife's point the quantity of a grain of mustard of it become stout marses and beget young cupids
the decay'd vestals of pict hatch would thank you that keep the fire alive there
'tis the secret of nature naturis'd 'gainst all infections cures all diseases coming of all causes a month's grief in a day a year's in twelve and of what age soever in a month past all the doses of your drugging doctors
i'll undertake withal to fright the plague out of the kingdom in three months
and i'll be bound the players shall sing your praises then without their poets
mean time i'll give away so much unto my man shall serve the whole city with preservative weekly each house his dose and at the rate as he that built the water work does with water
faith i have a humour i would not willingly be gull'd
your stone cannot transmute me
pertinax my surly will you believe antiquity
i'll shew you a book where moses and his sister and solomon have written of the art ay and a treatise penn'd by adam how
of the philosopher's stone and in high dutch
did adam write sir in high dutch
he did which proves it was the primitive tongue
o that indeed they say will last 'gainst worms
'tis like your irish wood 'gainst cob webs
i have a piece of jason's fleece too which was no other than a book of alchemy writ in large sheep skin a good fat ram vellum
such was pythagoras' thigh pandora's tub and all that fable of medea's charms the manner of our work the bulls our furnace still breathing fire our argent vive the dragon the dragon's teeth mercury sublimate that keeps the whiteness hardness and the biting and they are gathered into jason's helm the alembic and then sow'd in mars his field and thence sublimed so often till they're fixed
both this the hesperian garden cadmus' story jove's shower the boon of midas argus' eyes boccace his demogorgon thousands more all abstract riddles of our stone
is our day come
the evening will set red upon you sir you have colour for it crimson the red ferment has done his office three hours hence prepare you to see projection
again i say to thee aloud be rich
this day thou shalt have ingots and to morrow give lords th' affront
is it my zephyrus right
blushes the bolt's head
like a wench with child sir that were but now discover'd to her master
my only care where to get stuff enough now to project on this town will not half serve me
buy the covering off o' churches
let them stand bare as do their auditory or cap them new with shingles
no good thatch thatch will lie light upon the rafters lungs
lungs i will manumit thee from the furnace i will restore thee thy complexion puffe lost in the embers and repair this brain hurt with the fume o' the metals
i have blown sir hard for your worship thrown by many a coal when 'twas not beech weigh'd those i put in just to keep your heat still even these blear'd eyes have wak'd to read your several colours sir of the pale citron the green lion the crow the peacock's tail the plumed swan
and lastly thou hast descry'd the flower the sanguis agni
at his prayers sir he good man he's doing his devotions for the success
lungs i will set a period to all thy labours thou shalt be the master of my seraglio
but do you hear
i'll geld you lungs
for i do mean to have a list of wives and concubines equal with solomon who had the stone alike with me and i will make me a back with the elixir that shall be as tough as hercules to encounter fifty a night
thou'rt sure thou saw'st it blood
both blood and spirit sir
i will have all my beds blown up not stuft down is too hard and then mine oval room fill'd with such pictures as tiberius took from elephantis and dull aretine but coldly imitated
then my glasses cut in more subtle angles to disperse and multiply the figures as i walk naked between my succubae
my mists i'll have of perfume vapour'd 'bout the room to lose ourselves in and my baths like pits to fall into from whence we will come forth and roll us dry in gossamer and roses
is it arrived at ruby
where i spy a wealthy citizen or a rich lawyer have a sublimed pure wife unto that fellow i'll send a thousand pound to be my cuckold
and i shall carry it
i'll have no bawds but fathers and mothers they will do it best best of all others
and my flatterers shall be the pure and gravest of divines that i can get for money
my mere fools eloquent burgesses and then my poets the same that writ so subtly of the fart whom i will entertain still for that subject
the few that would give out themselves to be court and town stallions and each where bely ladies who are known most innocent for them those will i beg to make me eunuchs of and they shall fan me with ten estrich tails a piece made in a plume to gather wind
we will be brave puffe now we have the med'cine
my meat shall all come in in indian shells dishes of agat set in gold and studded with emeralds sapphires hyacinths and rubies
the tongues of carps dormice and camels' heels boil'd in the spirit of sol and dissolv'd pearl apicius' diet 'gainst the epilepsy and i will eat these broths with spoons of amber headed with diamond and carbuncle
my foot boy shall eat pheasants calver'd salmons knots godwits lampreys i myself will have the beards of barbels served instead of sallads oil'd mushrooms and the swelling unctuous paps of a fat pregnant sow newly cut off drest with an exquisite and poignant sauce for which i'll say unto my cook "there's gold go forth and be a knight
" sir i'll go look a little how it heightens
my shirts i'll have of taffeta sarsnet soft and light as cobwebs and for all my other raiment it shall be such as might provoke the persian were he to teach the world riot anew
my gloves of fishes' and birds' skins perfumed with gums of paradise and eastern air and do you think to have the stone with this
no i do think t' have all this with the stone
why i have heard he must be homo frugi a pious holy and religious man one free from mortal sin a very virgin
that makes it sir he is so but i buy it my venture brings it me
he honest wretch a notable superstitious good soul has worn his knees bare and his slippers bald with prayer and fasting for it and sir let him do it alone for me still
not a profane word afore him 'tis poison
gentle son good morrow and to your friend there
what is he is with you
an heretic that i did bring along in hope sir to convert him
son i doubt you are covetous that thus you meet your time in the just point prevent your day at morning
this argues something worthy of a fear of importune and carnal appetite
take heed you do not cause the blessing leave you with your ungovern'd haste
i should be sorry to see my labours now even at perfection got by long watching and large patience not prosper where my love and zeal hath placed them
which heaven i call to witness with your self to whom i have pour'd my thoughts in all my ends have look'd no way but unto public good to pious uses and dear charity now grown a prodigy with men
wherein if you my son should now prevaricate and to your own particular lusts employ so great and catholic a bliss be sure a curse will follow yea and overtake your subtle and most secret ways
i know sir you shall not need to fear me i but come to have you confute this gentleman
who is indeed sir somewhat costive of belief toward your stone would not be gull'd
well son all that i can convince him in is this the bright sol is in his robe
we have a medicine of the triple soul the glorified spirit
thanks be to heaven and make us worthy of it
look well to the register
and let your heat still lessen by degrees to the aludels
did you look on the bolt's head yet
ay what's the complexion
infuse vinegar to draw his volatile substance and his tincture and let the water in glass e be filter'd and put into the gripe's egg
lute him well and leave him closed in balneo
what a brave language here is
i have another work you never saw son that three days since past the philosopher's wheel in the lent heat of athanor and's become sulphur of nature
but 'tis for me
you have enough in that is perfect
o but why this is covetise
no i assure you i shall employ it all in pious uses founding of colleges and grammar schools marrying young virgins building hospitals and now and then a church
sir please you shall i not change the filter
marry yes and bring me the complexion of glass have you another
yes son were i assured your piety were firm we would not want the means to glorify it but i hope the best
i mean to tinct c in sand heat to morrow and give him imbibition
no sir of red
f is come over the helm too i thank my maker in mary's bath and shews lac virginis
i sent you of his faeces there calcined out of that calx i have won the salt of mercury
by pouring on your rectified water
yes and reverberating in athanor
what colour says it
the ground black sir
that's your crow's head
your cock's comb's is it not
no 'tis not perfect
would it were the crow
that work wants something
o i looked for this
the hay's a pitching
are you sure you loosed them in their own menstrue
yes sir and then married them and put them in a bolt's head nipp'd to digestion according as you bade me when i set the liquor of mars to circulation in the same heat
the process then was right
yes by the token sir the retort brake and what was saved was put into the pellican and sign'd with hermes' seal
i think 'twas so
we should have a new amalgama
o this ferret is rank as any pole cat
but i care not let him e'en die we have enough beside in embrion
h has his white shirt on
yes sir he's ripe for inceration he stands warm in his ash fire
i would not you should let any die now if i might counsel sir for luck's sake to the rest it is not good
ay are you bolted
nay i know't sir i have seen the ill fortune
what is some three ounces of fresh materials
of gold t'amalgame with some six of mercury
give him nine pound you may give him ten
yes twenty and be cozen'd do
this needs not but that you will have it so to see conclusions of all for two of our inferior works are at fixation a third is in ascension
have you set the oil of luna in kemia
and the philosopher's vinegar
we shall have a sallad
when do you make projection
son be not hasty i exalt our med'cine by hanging him in balneo vaporoso and giving him solution then congeal him and then dissolve him then again congeal him for look how oft i iterate the work so many times i add unto his virtue
as if at first one ounce convert a hundred after his second loose he'll turn a thousand his third solution ten his fourth a hundred after his fifth a thousand thousand ounces of any imperfect metal into pure silver or gold in all examinations as good as any of the natural mine
get you your stuff here against afternoon your brass your pewter and your andirons
not those of iron
yes you may bring them too we'll change all metals
i believe you in that
then i may send my spits
yes and your racks
and dripping pans and pot hangers and hooks
to be an ass
this gentleman you must bear withal i told you he had no faith
and little hope sir but much less charity should i gull myself
why what have you observ'd sir in our art seems so impossible
but your whole work no more
that you should hatch gold in a furnace sir as they do eggs in egypt
sir do you believe that eggs are hatch'd so
why i think that the greater miracle
no egg but differs from a chicken more than metals in themselves
the egg's ordain'd by nature to that end and is a chicken in potentia
the same we say of lead and other metals which would be gold if they had time
and that our art doth further
ay for 'twere absurb to think that nature in the earth bred gold perfect in the instant something went before
there must be remote matter
ay what is that
marry we say ay now it heats stand father pound him to dust
it is of the one part a humid exhalation which we call material liquida or the unctuous water on the other part a certain crass and vicious portion of earth both which concorporate do make the elementary matter of gold which is not yet propria materia but common to all metals and all stones for where it is forsaken of that moisture and hath more driness it becomes a stone where it retains more of the humid fatness it turns to sulphur or to quicksilver who are the parents of all other metals
nor can this remote matter suddenly progress so from extreme unto extreme as to grow gold and leap o'er all the means
nature doth first beget the imperfect then proceeds she to the perfect
of that airy and oily water mercury is engender'd sulphur of the fat and earthy part the one which is the last supplying the place of male the other of the female in all metals
some do believe hermaphrodeity that both do act and suffer
but these two make the rest ductile malleable extensive
and even in gold they are for we do find seeds of them by our fire and gold in them and can produce the species of each metal more perfect thence than nature doth in earth
beside who doth not see in daily practice art can beget bees hornets beetles wasps out of the carcases and dung of creatures yea scorpions of an herb being rightly placed
and these are living creatures far more perfect and excellent than metals
nay if he take you in hand sir with an argument he'll bray you in a mortar
pray you sir stay
rather than i'll be brayed sir i'll believe that alchemy is a pretty kind of game somewhat like tricks o' the cards to cheat a man with charming
what else are all your terms whereon no one of your writers 'grees with other
of your elixir your lac virginis your stone your med'cine and your chrysosperm your sal your sulphur and your mercury your oil of height your tree of life your blood your marchesite your tutie your magnesia your toad your crow your dragon and your panther your sun your moon your firmament your adrop your lato azoch zernich chibrit heautarit and then your red man and your white woman with all your broths your menstrues and materials of piss and egg shells women's terms man's blood hair o' the head burnt clouts chalk merds and clay powder of bones scalings of iron glass and worlds of other strange ingredients would burst a man to name
and all these named intending but one thing which art our writers used to obscure their art
sir so i told him because the simple idiot should not learn it and make it vulgar
was not all the knowledge of the aegyptians writ in mystic symbols
speak not the scriptures oft in parables
are not the choicest fables of the poets that were the fountains and first springs of wisdom wrapp'd in perplexed allegories
i urg'd that and clear'd to him that sisyphus was damn'd to roll the ceaseless stone only because he would have made ours common
what do you mean
go in good lady let me entreat you
do you use me thus
go in and see you traitor
who is it sir
what's the matter good sir
i have not seen you thus distemper'd who is't
all arts have still had sir their adversaries but ours the most ignorant
'twas not my fault sir she would speak with you
i dare not sir
stay man what is she
a lord's sister sir
she's mad sir and sent hither he'll be mad too
sir to be cured
'fore god a bradamante a brave piece
heart this is a bawdy house
i will be burnt else
o by this light no do not wrong him
he's too scrupulous that way it is his vice
no he's a rare physician do him right an excellent paracelsian and has done strange cures with mineral physic
he deals all with spirits he he will not hear a word of galen or his tedious recipes
softly sir speak softly
i meant to have told your worship all
this must not hear
no he will not be "gull'd" let him alone
you are very right sir she is a most rare scholar and is gone mad with studying broughton's works
if you but name a word touching the hebrew she falls into her fit and will discourse so learnedly of genealogies as you would run mad too to hear her sir
how might one do t' have conference with her lungs
o divers have run mad upon the conference i do not know sir
i am sent in haste to fetch a vial
be not gull'd sir mammon
pray ye be patient
yes as you are and trust confederate knaves and bawds and whores
you are too foul believe it
come here ulen one word
i dare not in good faith
he is extreme angry that you saw her sir
what is she when she's out of her fit
o the most affablest creature sir
she'll mount you up like quicksilver over the helm and circulate like oil a very vegetal discourse of state of mathematics bawdry any thing is she no way accessible
no means no trick to give a man a taste of her wit or so
i'll come to you again sir
surly i did not think one of your breeding would traduce personages of worth
sir epicure your friend to use yet still loth to be gull'd i do not like your philosophical bawds
their stone is letchery enough to pay for without this bait
'heart you abuse yourself
i know the lady and her friends and means the original of this disaster
her brother has told me all
and yet you never saw her till now
o yes but i forgot
i have believe it one of the treacherousest memories i do think of all mankind
what call you her brother
my lord he will not have his name known now i think on't
a very treacherous memory
on my faith tut if you have it not about you pass it till we meet next
nay by this hand 'tis true
he's one i honour and my noble friend and i respect his house
can it be that a grave sir a rich that has no need a wise sir too at other times should thus with his own oaths and arguments make hard means to gull himself
an this be your elixir your lapis mineralis and your lunary give me your honest trick yet at primero or gleek and take your lutum sapientis your menstruum simplex
i'll have gold before you and with less danger of the quicksilver or the hot sulphur
here's one from captain face sir desires you meet him in the temple church some half hour hence and upon earnest business
sir if you please to quit us now and come again within two hours you shall have my master busy examining o' the works and i will steal you in unto the party that you may see her converse
sir shall i say you'll meet the captain's worship
but by attorney and to a second purpose
now i am sure it is a bawdy house i'll swear it were the marshal here to thank me the naming this commander doth confirm it
why he's the most authentic dealer in these commodities the superintendant to all the quainter traffickers in town
he is the visitor and does appoint who lies with whom and at what hour what price which gown and in what smock what fall what tire
him will i prove by a third person to find the subtleties of this dark labyrinth which if i do discover dear sir mammon you'll give your poor friend leave though no philosopher to laugh for you that are 'tis thought shall weep
sir he does pray you'll not forget
i will not sir
sir epicure i shall leave you
i follow you straight
but do so good sir to avoid suspicion
this gentleman has a parlous head
but wilt thou ulen be constant to thy promise
as my life sir
and wilt thou insinuate what i am and praise me and say i am a noble fellow
o what else sir
and that you'll make her royal with the stone an empress and yourself king of bantam
wilt thou do this
send your stuff sir that my master may busy himself about projection
thou hast witch'd me rogue take go
your jack and all sir
thou art a villain i will send my jack and the weights too
slave i could bite thine ear
away thou dost not care for me
come i was born to make thee my good weasel set thee on a bench and have thee twirl a chain with the best lord's vermin of 'em all
a count nay a count palatine good sir go
shall not advance thee better no nor faster
and swallowed too my subtle
i have given him line and now he plays i'faith
and shall we twitch him
thorough both the gills
a wench is a rare bait with which a man no sooner's taken but he straight firks mad
dol my lord what'ts'hums sister you must now bear yourself statelich
o let me alone
i'll not forget my race i warrant you
i'll keep my distance laugh and talk aloud have all the tricks of a proud scurvy lady and be as rude as her woman
but will he send his andirons
his jack too and's iron shoeing horn i have spoke to him
well i must not lose my wary gamester yonder
o monsieur caution that ay if i can strike a fine hook into him now
the temple church there i have cast mine angle
well pray for me
stay face you must go to the door 'pray god it be my anabaptist who is't dol
i know him not he looks like a gold endman
'tis he he said he would send what call you him
the sanctified elder that should deal for mammon's jack and andirons
stay help me off first with my gown
away madam to your withdrawing chamber
now in a new tune new gesture but old language
this fellow is sent from one negociates with me about the stone too for the holy brethren of amsterdam the exiled saints that hope to raise their discipline by it
i must use him in some strange fashion now to make him admire me
where is my drudge
take away the recipient and rectify your menstrue from the phlegma
then pour it on the sol in the cucurbite and let them macerate together
and save the ground
no terra damnata must not have entrance in the work
a faithful brother if it please you
can you sublime and dulcify
know you the sapor pontic
or what is homogene or heterogene
i understand no heathen language truly
is ars sacra or chrysopoeia or spagyrica or the pamphysic or panarchic knowledge a heathen language
heathen greek i take it
all's heathen but the hebrew
sirrah my varlet stand you forth and speak to him like a philosopher answer in the language
name the vexations and the martyrisations of metals in the work
sir putrefaction solution ablution sublimation cohobation calcination ceration and fixation
this is heathen greek to you now
and when comes vivification
'tis the pouring on your aqua regis and then drawing him off to the trine circle of the seven spheres
what's the proper passion of metals
what's your ultimum supplicium auri
this is heathen greek to you
and what's your mercury
a very fugitive he will be gone sir
how know you him
by his viscosity his oleosity and his suscitability
how do you sublime him
with the calce of egg shells white marble talc
your magisterium now what's that
shifting sir your elements dry into cold cold into moist moist into hot hot into dry
this is heathen greek to you still
'tis a stone and not a stone a spirit a soul and a body which if you do dissolve it is dissolved if you coagulate it is coagulated if you make it to fly it flieth
this is heathen greek to you
what are you sir
please you a servant of the exiled brethren that deal with widows' and with orphans' goods and make a just account unto the saints a deacon
o you are sent from master wholesome your teacher
from tribulation wholesome our very zealous pastor
i have some orphans' goods to come here
of what kind sir
pewter and brass andirons and kitchen ware metals that we must use our medicine on wherein the brethren may have a pennyworth for ready money
were the orphans' parents sincere professors
why do you ask
because we then are to deal justly and give in truth their utmost value
'slid you'd cozen else and if their parents were not of the faithful
i will not trust you now i think on it 'till i have talked with your pastor
have you brought money to buy more coals
the brethren bid me say unto you sir surely they will not venture any more till they may see projection
you have had for the instruments as bricks and lome and glasses already thirty pound and for materials they say some ninety more and they have heard since that one at heidelberg made it of an egg and a small paper of pin dust
my name is ananias
out the varlet that cozen'd the apostles
had your holy consistory no name to send me of another sound than wicked ananias
send your elders hither to make atonement for you quickly and give me satisfaction or out goes the fire and down th' alembics and the furnace piger henricus or what not
both sericon and bufo shall be lost tell them
all hope of rooting out the bishops or the antichristian hierarchy shall perish if they stay threescore minutes the aqueity terreity and sulphureity shall run together again and all be annull'd thou wicked ananias
this will fetch 'em and make them haste towards their gulling more
a man must deal like a rough nurse and fright those that are froward to an appetite
he is busy with his spirits but we'll upon him
what mates what baiards have we here
i told you he would be furious
sir here's nab has brought you another piece of gold to look on we must appease him
give it me and prays you you would devise what is it nab
ay a good lucky one a thriving sign doctor
i was devising now
'slight do not say so he will repent he gave you any more what say you to his constellation doctor the balance
no that way is stale and common
a townsman born in taurus gives the bull or the bull's head in aries the ram a poor device
no i will have his name form'd in some mystic character whose radii striking the senses of the passers by shall by a virtual influence breed affections that may result upon the party owns it as thus nab
he shall have "a bell" that's "abel" and by it standing one whose name is "dee" in a "rug" gown there's and "rug" that's "drug" and right anenst him a dog snarling "er" there's "drugger" abel drugger
and here's now mystery and hieroglyphic
abel thou art made
sir i do thank his worship
six o' thy legs more will not do it nab
he has brought you a pipe of tobacco doctor
yes sir i have another thing i would impart out with it nab
sir there is lodged hard by me a rich young widow good
but nineteen at the most
marry she's not in fashion yet she wears a hood but it stands a cop
and i do now and then give her a fucus what
dost thou deal nab
i did tell you captain
and physic too sometime sir for which she trusts me with all her mind
she's come up here of purpose to learn the fashion
good his match too
and she does strangely long to know her fortune
ods lid nab send her to the doctor hither
yes i have spoke to her of his worship already but she's afraid it will be blown abroad and hurt her marriage
'tis the way to heal it if 'twere hurt to make it more follow'd and sought nab thou shalt tell her this
she'll be more known more talk'd of and your widows are ne'er of any price till they be famous their honour is their multitude of suitors
send her it may be thy good fortune
thou dost not know
no sir she'll never marry under a knight her brother has made a vow
and dost thou despair my little nab knowing what the doctor has set down for thee and seeing so many of the city dubb'd
one glass o' thy water with a madam i know will have it done nab what's her brother a knight
no sir a gentleman newly warm in his land sir scarce cold in his one and twenty that does govern his sister here and is a man himself of some three thousand a year and is come up to learn to quarrel and to live by his wits and will go down again and die in the country
yes sir to carry quarrels as gallants do to manage them by line
'slid nab the doctor is the only man in christendom for him
he has made a table with mathematical demonstrations touching the art of quarrels he will give him an instrument to quarrel by
go bring them both him and his sister
and for thee with her the doctor happ'ly may persuade
go to 'shalt give his worship a new damask suit upon the premises
he shall he is the honestest fellow doctor
stay not no offers bring the damask and the parties
i'll try my power sir
and thy will too nab
'tis good tobacco this
what is't an ounce
he'll send you a pound doctor
it is the goodest soul
thou shalt know more anon
a miserable rogue and lives with cheese and has the worms
that was the cause indeed why he came now he dealt with me in private to get a med'cine for them
a wife a wife for one on us my dear subtle
we'll e'en draw lots and he that fails shall have the more in goods the other has in tail
rather the less for she may be so light she may want grains
ay or be such a burden a man would scarce endure her for the whole
faith best let's see her first and then determine
content but dol must have no breath on't
away you to your surly yonder catch him
'pray god i have not staid too long
these chastisements are common to the saints and such rebukes we of the separation must bear with willing shoulders as the trials sent forth to tempt our frailties
in pure zeal i do not like the man he is a heathen and speaks the language of canaan truly
i think him a profane person indeed
he bears the visible mark of the beast in his forehead
and for his stone it is a work of darkness and with philosophy blinds the eyes of man
good brother we must bend unto all means that may give furtherance to the holy cause
which his cannot the sanctified cause should have a sanctified course
not always necessary the children of perdition are oft times made instruments even of the greatest works beside we should give somewhat to man's nature the place he lives in still about the fire and fume of metals that intoxicate the brain of man and make him prone to passion
where have you greater atheists than your cooks
or more profane or choleric than your glass men
more antichristian than your bell founders
what makes the devil so devilish i would ask you sathan our common enemy but his being perpetually about the fire and boiling brimstone and arsenic
we must give i say unto the motives and the stirrers up of humours in the blood
it may be so when as the work is done the stone is made this heat of his may turn into a zeal and stand up for the beauteous discipline against the menstruous cloth and rag of rome
we must await his calling and the coming of the good spirit
you did fault t' upbraid him with the brethren's blessing of heidelberg weighing what need we have to hasten on the work for the restoring of the silenced saints which ne'er will be but by the philosopher's stone
and so a learned elder one of scotland assured me aurum potabile being the only med'cine for the civil magistrate incline him to a feeling of the cause and must be daily used in the disease
i have not edified more truly by man not since the beautiful light first shone on me and i am sad my zeal hath so offended
let us call on him then
the motion's good and of the spirit i will knock first
a o are you come
your threescore minutes were at last thread you see and down had gone furnus acediae turris circulatorius lembec bolt's head retort and pelican had all been cinders
nay then it goes down yet
sir be appeased he is come to humble himself in spirit and to ask your patience if too much zeal hath carried him aside from the due path
why this doth qualify
the brethren had no purpose verily to give you the least grievance but are ready to lend their willing hands to any project the spirit and you direct
and for the orphans' goods let them be valued or what is needful else to the holy work it shall be numbered here by me the saints throw down their purse before you
why thus it should be now you understand
have i discours'd so unto you of our stone and of the good that it shall bring your cause
shew'd you beside the main of hiring forces abroad drawing the hollanders your friends from the indies to serve you with all their fleet that even the med'cinal use shall make you a faction and party in the realm
as put the case that some great man in state he have the gout why you but send three drops of your elixir you help him straight there you have made a friend
another has the palsy or the dropsy he takes of your incombustible stuff he's young again there you have made a friend a lady that is past the feat of body though not of mind and hath her face decay'd beyond all cure of paintings you restore with the oil of talc there you have made a friend and all her friends
a lord that is a leper a knight that has the bone ache or a squire that hath both these you make them smooth and sound with a bare fricace of your med'cine still you increase your friends
ay it is very pregnant
and then the turning of this lawyer's pewter to plate at christmas
christ tide i pray you
or changing his parcel gilt to massy gold
you cannot but raise you friends
withal to be of power to pay an army in the field to buy the king of france out of his realms or spain out of his indies
what can you not do against lords spiritual or temporal that shall oppone you
we may be temporal lords ourselves i take it
you may be any thing and leave off to make long winded exercises or suck up your "ha
" in a tune
i not deny but such as are not graced in a state may for their ends be adverse in religion and get a tune to call the flock together for to say sooth a tune does much with women and other phlegmatic people it is your bell
bells are profane a tune may be religious
no warning with you
then farewell my patience
'slight it shall down i will not be thus tortured
i pray you sir
i have spoken it
let me find grace sir in your eyes the man he stands corrected neither did his zeal but as your self allow a tune somewhere
which now being tow'rd the stone we shall not need
no nor your holy vizard to win widows to give you legacies or make zealous wives to rob their husbands for the common cause nor take the start of bonds broke but one day and say they were forfeited by providence
nor shall you need o'er night to eat huge meals to celebrate your next day's fast the better the whilst the brethren and the sisters humbled abate the stiffness of the flesh
nor cast before your hungry hearers scrupulous bones as whether a christian may hawk or hunt or whether matrons of the holy assembly may lay their hair out or wear doublets or have that idol starch about their linen
it is indeed an idol
mind him not sir
i do command thee spirit of zeal but trouble to peace within him
pray you sir go on
nor shall you need to libel 'gainst the prelates and shorten so your ears against the hearing of the next wire drawn grace
nor of necessity rail against plays to please the alderman whose daily custard you devour nor lie with zealous rage till you are hoarse
not one of these so singular arts
nor call yourselves by names of tribulation persecution restraint long patience and such like affected by the whole family or wood of you only for glory and to catch the ear of the disciple
truly sir they are ways that the godly brethren have invented for propagation of the glorious cause as very notable means and whereby also themselves grow soon and profitably famous
o but the stone all's idle to it
the art of angels' nature's miracle the divine secret that doth fly in clouds from east to west and whose tradition is not from men but spirits
i hate traditions i do not trust them peace
they are popish all
i will not peace i will not ananias
please the profane to grieve the godly i may not
well ananias thou shalt overcome
it is an ignorant zeal that haunts him sir but truly else a very faithful brother a botcher and a man by revelation that hath a competent knowledge of the truth
has he a competent sum there in the bag to buy the goods within
i am made guardian and must for charity and conscience sake now see the most be made for my poor orphan though i desire the brethren too good gainers there they are within
when you have view'd and bought 'em and ta'en the inventory of what they are they are ready for projection there's no more to do cast on the med'cine so much silver as there is tin there so much gold as brass i'll give't you in by weight
but how long time sir must the saints expect yet
let me see how's the moon now
eight nine ten days hence he will be silver potate then three days before he citronise some fifteen days the magisterium will be perfected
about the second day of the third week in the ninth month
yes my good ananias
what will the orphan's goods arise to think you
some hundred marks as much as fill'd three cars unladed now you'll make six millions of them
but i must have more coals laid in
another load and then we have finish'd
we must now increase our fire to ignis ardens we are past fimus equinus balnei cineris and all those lenter heats
if the holy purse should with this draught fall low and that the saints do need a present sum i have a trick to melt the pewter you shall buy now instantly and with a tincture make you as good dutch dollars as any are in holland
ay and shall 'bide the third examination
it will be joyful tidings to the brethren
but you must carry it secret
ay but stay this act of coining is it lawful
we know no magistrate or if we did this is foreign coin
it is no coining sir
it is but casting
you distinguish well casting of money may be lawful
truly i take it so
there is no scruple sir to be made of it believe ananias this case of conscience he is studied in
i'll make a question of it to the brethren
the brethren shall approve it lawful doubt not
where shall it be done
for that we'll talk anon
there's some to speak with me
go in i pray you and view the parcels
i'll come to you straight
yond' costive cheater never came on
i have walk'd the round till now and no such thing
and have you quit him
an hell would quit him too he were happy
would you have me stalk like a mill jade all day for one that will not yield us grains
i know him of old
o but to have gull'd him had been a mastery
let him go black boy
and turn thee that some fresh news may possess thee
a noble count a don of spain my dear delicious compeer and my party bawd who is come hither private for his conscience and brought munition with him six great slops bigger than three dutch hoys beside round trunks furnished with pistolets and pieces of eight will straight be here my rogue to have thy bath that is the colour and to make his battery upon our dol our castle our cinque port our dover pier our what thou wilt
she must prepare perfumes delicate linen the bath in chief a banquet and her wit for she must milk his epididimis

art thou so near
yes say lord general how fares our camp
as with the few that had entrench'd themselves safe by their discipline against a world dol and laugh'd within those trenches and grew fat with thinking on the booties dol brought in daily by their small parties
this dear hour a doughty don is taken with my dol and thou mayst make his ransom what thou wilt my dousabel he shall be brought here fetter'd with thy fair looks before he sees thee and thrown in a down bed as dark as any dungeon where thou shalt keep him waking with thy drum thy drum my dol thy drum till he be tame as the poor black birds were in the great frost or bees are with a bason and so hive him in the swan skin coverlid and cambric sheets till he work honey and wax my little god's gift

a pox on 'em they are so long a furnishing
such stinkards would not be seen upon these festival days
they are gone the sum is here in bank my face
i would we knew another chapman now would buy 'em outright
'slid nab shall do't against he have the widow to furnish household
excellent well thought on pray god he come
i pray he keep away till our new business be o'erpast
but face how cam'st thou by this secret don
a spirit brought me th' intelligence in a paper here as i was conjuring yonder in my circle for surly i have my flies abroad
your bath is famous subtle by my means
sweet dol you must go tune your virginal no losing the least time and do you hear
firk like a flounder kiss like a scallop close and tickle him with thy mother tongue
his great verdugoship has not a jot of language so much the easier to be cozen'd my dolly
he will come here in a hired coach obscure and our own coachman whom i have sent as guide no creature else
it is not he
o no not yet this hour
god's will then queen of fairy on with your tire and doctor with your robes
let's dispatch him for god's sake
i warrant you take but the cues i give you it shall be brief enough
'slight here are more
abel and i think the angry boy the heir that fain would quarrel
no not that i see
o sir you are welcome
the doctor is within a moving for you i have had the most ado to win him to it
he swears you'll be the darling of the dice he never heard her highness dote till now
your aunt has given you the most gracious words that can be thought on
shall i see her grace
see her and kiss her too
hast brought the damask
no sir here's tobacco
'tis well done nab thou'lt bring the damask too
yes here's the gentleman captain master kastril i have brought to see the doctor
sir as he likes his sister he says shall come
o is it so
is your name kastril sir
ay and the best of the kastrils i'd be sorry else by fifteen hundred a year
where is the doctor
my mad tobacco boy here tells me of one that can do things has he any skill
to carry a business manage a quarrel fairly upon fit terms
it seems sir you are but young about the town that can make that a question
sir not so young but i have heard some speech of the angry boys and seen them take tobacco and in his shop and i can take it too
and i would fain be one of 'em and go down and practise in the country
sir for the duello the doctor i assure you shall inform you to the least shadow of a hair and shew you an instrument he has of his own making wherewith no sooner shall you make report of any quarrel but he will take the height on't most instantly and tell in what degree of safety it lies in or mortality
and how it may be borne whether in a right line or a half circle or may else be cast into an angle blunt if not acute and this he will demonstrate
and then rules to give and take the lie by
yes in oblique he'll shew you or in circle but never in diameter
the whole town study his theorems and dispute them ordinarily at the eating academies
but does he teach living by the wits too
you cannot think that subtlety but he reads it
he made me a captain
i was a stark pimp just of your standing 'fore i met with him it is not two months since
i'll tell you his method first he will enter you at some ordinary
no i'll not come there you shall pardon me
there's gaming there and tricks
why would you be a gallant and not game
ay 'twill spend a man
it will repair you when you are spent how do they live by their wits there that have vented six times your fortunes
what three thousand a year
ay sir and gallants yet
here's a young gentleman is born to nothing forty marks a year which i count nothing he is to be initiated and have a fly of the doctor
he will win you by unresistible luck within this fortnight enough to buy a barony
they will set him upmost at the groom porter's all the christmas and for the whole year through at every place where there is play present him with the chair the best attendance the best drink sometimes two glasses of canary and pay nothing the purest linen and the sharpest knife the partridge next his trencher and somewhere the dainty bed in private with the dainty
you shall have your ordinaries bid for him as play houses for a poet and the master pray him aloud to name what dish he affects which must be butter'd shrimps and those that drink to no mouth else will drink to his as being the goodly president mouth of all the board
do you not gull one
do you think it
you shall have a cast commander can but get in credit with a glover or a spurrier for some two pair of either's ware aforehand will by most swift posts dealing but with him arrive at competent means to keep himself his punk and naked boy in excellent fashion and be admired for't
will the doctor teach this
he will do more sir when your land is gone as men of spirit hate to keep earth long in a vacation when small money is stirring and ordinaries suspended till the term he'll shew a perspective where on one side you shall behold the faces and the persons of all sufficient young heirs in town whose bonds are current for commodity on th' other side the merchants' forms and others that without help of any second broker who would expect a share will trust such parcels in the third square the very street and sign where the commodity dwells and does but wait to be deliver'd be it pepper soap hops or tobacco oatmeal woad or cheeses
all which you may so handle to enjoy to your own use and never stand obliged
is he such a fellow
why nab here knows him
and then for making matches for rich widows young gentlewomen heirs the fortunat'st man
he's sent to far and near all over england to have his counsel and to know their fortunes
god's will my suster shall see him
i'll tell you sir what he did tell me of nab
it's a strange thing by the way you must eat no cheese nab it breeds melancholy and that same melancholy breeds worms but pass it he told me honest nab here was ne'er at tavern but once in's life
truth and no more i was not
and then he was so sick could he tell you that too
how should i know it
in troth we had been a shooting and had a piece of fat ram mutton to supper that lay so heavy o' my stomach and he has no head to bear any wine for what with the noise of the fidlers and care of his shop for he dares keep no servants my head did so ach and he was fain to be brought home the doctor told me and then a good old woman yes faith she dwells in sea coal lane did cure me with sodden ale and pellitory of the wall cost me but two pence
i had another sickness was worse than that
ay that was with the grief thou took'st for being cess'd at eighteen pence for the water work
in truth and it was like have cost me almost my life
thy hair went off
yes sir 'twas done for spight
nay so says the doctor
pray thee tobacco boy go fetch my suster i'll see this learned boy before i go and so shall she
sir he is busy now but if you have a sister to fetch hither perhaps your own pains may command her sooner and he by that time will be free
drugger she's thine the damask
subtle and i must wrestle for her
come on master dapper you see how i turn clients here away to give your cause dispatch have you perform'd the ceremonies were enjoin'd you
yes of the vinegar and the clean shirt
'tis well that shirt may do you more worship than you think
your aunt's a fire but that she will not shew it t' have a sight of you
have you provided for her grace's servants
yes here are six score edward shillings
and an old harry's sovereign
and three james shillings and an elizabeth groat just twenty nobles

i would you had had the other noble in maries
i have some philip and maries
ay those same are best of all where are they
a a a is yet her grace's cousin come
and is he fasting
and hath cried hum
thrice you must answer
and as oft buz
if you have say
then to her cuz hoping that he hath vinegar'd his senses as he was bid the fairy queen dispenses by me this robe the petticoat of fortune which that he straight put on she doth importune
and though to fortune near be her petticoat yet nearer is her smock the queen doth note and therefore ev'n of that a piece she hath sent which being a child to wrap him in was rent and prays him for a scarf he now will wear it with as much love as then her grace did tear it about his eyes to shew he is fortunate
and trusting unto her to make his state he'll throw away all worldly pelf about him which that he will perform she doth not doubt him
she need not doubt him sir
alas he has nothing but what he will part withal as willingly upon her grace's word throw away your purse as she would ask it handkerchiefs and all she cannot bid that thing but he'll obey
if you have a ring about you cast it off or a silver seal at your wrist her grace will send her fairies here to search you therefore deal directly with her highness if they find that you conceal a mite you are undone
keep nothing that is transitory about you
bid dol play music
look the elves are come
to pinch you if you tell not truth
i have a paper with a spur ryal in't
they knew't they say
ti ti ti ti
he has more yet

they must pinch him or he will never confess they say
o nay pray you hold he is her grace's nephew ti ti ti
good faith you shall care
deal plainly sir and shame the fairies
shew you are innocent
by this good light i have nothing
ti ti ti ti to ta
he does equivocate she says ti ti do ti ti ti do ti da and swears by the when he is blinded
by this good i have nothing but a half crown of gold about my wrist that my love gave me and a leaden heart i wore since she forsook me
i thought 'twas something
and would you incur your aunt's displeasure for these trifles
come i had rather you had thrown away twenty half crowns
you may wear your leaden heart still
yonder's your knight sir mammon
'ods lid we never thought of him till now
here hard by he is at the door
and you are not ready now
dol get his suit
he must not be sent back
o by no means
what shall we do with this same puffin here now he's on the spit
why lay him back awhile with some device
ti ti ti ti ti ti would her grace speak with me
sir epicure my master's in the way
please you to walk three or four turns but till his back be turned and i am for you
her grace commends her kindly to you master dapper
i long to see her grace
she now is set at dinner in her bed and she has sent you from her own private trencher a dead mouse and a piece of gingerbread to be merry withal and stay your stomach lest you faint with fasting yet if you could hold out till she saw you she says it would be better for you
sir he shall hold out an 'twere this two hours for her highness i can assure you that
we will not lose all we have done
he must not see nor speak to any body till then
for that we'll put sir a stay in's mouth
make you it fit
he that hath pleas'd her grace thus far shall not now crincle for a little
gape sir and let him fit you
a where shall we now bestow him
come along sir i now must shew you fortune's privy lodgings
are they perfumed and his bath ready
all only the fumigation's somewhat strong
sir epicure i am yours sir by and by
a o sir you're come in the only finest time
now preparing for projection sir
your stuff will be all changed shortly
to gold and silver sir
silver i care not for
yes sir a little to give beggars
i have told her such brave things of you touching your bounty and your noble spirit hast thou
as she is almost in her fit to see you
but good sir no divinity in your conference for fear of putting her in rage
six men sir will not hold her down and then if the old man should hear or see you fear not
the very house sir would run mad
you know it how scrupulous he is and violent 'gainst the least act of sin
physic or mathematics poetry state or bawdry as i told you she will endure and never startle but no word of controversy
i am school'd good ulen
and you must praise her house remember that and her nobility
let me alone no herald no nor antiquary lungs shall do it better
why this is yet a kind of modern happiness to have dol common for a great lady
now epicure heighten thyself talk to her all in gold rain her as many showers as jove did drops unto his danae shew the god a miser compared with mammon
the stone will do't
she shall feel gold taste gold hear gold sleep gold nay we will concumbere gold i will be puissant and mighty in my talk to her
to him dol suckle him
this is the noble knight i told your ladyship madam with your pardon i kiss your vesture
sir i were uncivil if i would suffer that my lip to you sir
i hope my lord your brother be in health lady
my lord my brother is though i no lady sir
well said my guinea bird
right noble madam o we shall have most fierce idolatry
were there nought else to enlarge your virtues to me these answers speak your breeding and your blood
blood we boast none sir a poor baron's daughter
had your father slept all the happy remnant of his life after that act lien but there still and panted he had done enough to make himself his issue and his posterity noble
sir although we may be said to want the gilt and trappings the dress of honour yet we strive to keep the seeds and the materials
i do see the old ingredient virtue was not lost nor the drug money used to make your compound
there is a strange nobility in your eye this lip that chin
methinks you do resemble one of the austriac princes
her father was an irish costermonger
the house of valois just had such a nose and such a forehead yet the medici of florence boast
troth and i have been liken'd to all these princes
i'll be sworn i heard it
i know not how
it is not any one but e'en the very choice of all their features
i'll in and laugh
a certain touch or air that sparkles a divinity beyond an earthly beauty
o you play the courtier
good lady give me leave in faith i may not to mock me sir
to burn in this sweet flame the phoenix never knew a nobler death
nay now you court the courtier and destroy what you would build
this art sir in your words calls your whole faith in question
by my soul nay oaths are made of the same air sir
nature never bestow'd upon mortality a more unblamed a more harmonious feature she play'd the step dame in all faces else sweet madam let me be particular particular sir
i pray you know your distance
in no ill sense sweet lady but to ask how your fair graces pass the hours
i see you are lodged here in the house of a rare man an excellent artist but what's that to you
yes sir i study here the mathematics and distillation
o i cry your pardon
he's a divine instructor
can extract the souls of all things by his art call all the virtues and the miracles of the sun into a temperate furnace teach dull nature what her own forces are
a man the emperor has courted above kelly sent his medals and chains to invite him
ay and for his physic sir above the art of aesculapius that drew the envy of the thunderer
i know all this and more
troth i am taken sir whole with these studies that contemplate nature
it is a noble humour but this form was not intended to so dark a use
had you been crooked foul of some coarse mould a cloister had done well but such a feature that might stand up the glory of a kingdom to live recluse
is a mere soloecism though in a nunnery
it must not be
i muse my lord your brother will permit it you should spend half my land first were i he
does not this diamond better on my finger than in the quarry
why you are like it
you were created lady for the light
here you shall wear it take it the first pledge of what i speak to bind you to believe me
in chains of adamant
yes the strongest bands
and take a secret too here by your side doth stand this hour the happiest man in europe
you are contended sir
nay in true being the envy of princes and the fear of states
say you so sir epicure
yes and thou shalt prove it daughter of honour
i have cast mine eye upon thy form and i will rear this beauty above all styles
you mean no treason sir
no i will take away that jealousy
i am the lord of the philosopher's stone and thou the lady
i am the master of the mystery
this day the good old wretch here o' the house has made it for us now he's at projection
think therefore thy first wish now let me hear it and it shall rain into thy lap no shower but floods of gold whole cataracts a deluge to get a nation on thee
you are pleased sir to work on the ambition of our sex
i am pleased the glory of her sex should know this nook here of the friars is no climate for her to live obscurely in to learn physic and surgery for the constable's wife of some odd hundred in essex but come forth and taste the air of palaces eat drink the toils of empirics and their boasted practice tincture of pearl and coral gold and amber be seen at feasts and triumphs have it ask'd what miracle she is set all the eyes of court a fire like a burning glass and work them into cinders when the jewels of twenty states adorn thee and the light strikes out the stars
that when thy name is mention'd queens may look pale and we but shewing our love nero's poppaea may be lost in story
thus will we have it
i could well consent sir
but in a monarchy how will this be
the prince will soon take notice and both seize you and your stone it being a wealth unfit for any private subject
if he knew it
yourself do boast it sir
to thee my life
o but beware sir
you may come to end the remnants of your days in a loth'd prison by speaking of it
'tis no idle fear
we'll therefore go withal my girl and live in a free state where we will eat our mullets soused in high country wines sup pheasants' eggs and have our cockles boil'd in silver shells our shrimps to swim again as when they liv'd in a rare butter made of dolphins' milk whose cream does look like opals and with these delicate meats set ourselves high for pleasure and take us down again and then renew our youth and strength with drinking the elixir and so enjoy a perpetuity of life and lust
and thou shalt have thy wardrobe richer than nature's still to change thy self and vary oftener for thy pride than she or art her wise and almost equal servant
sir you are too loud
i hear you every word into the laboratory
some fitter place the garden or great chamber above
how like you her
but do you hear
good sir beware no mention of the rabbins
we think not on 'em
o it is well sir
dost thou not laugh
yes are they gone
the widow is come
and your quarrelling disciple
i must to my captainship again then
stay bring them in first
we'll draw lots you'll stand to that
o for a suit to fall now like a curtain flap
to the door man
you'll have the first kiss 'cause i am not ready
yes and perhaps hit you through both the nostrils
who would you speak with
gone sir about some business
but master doctor his lieutenant is here
come near my worshipful boy my terrae fili that is my boy of land make thy approaches welcome i know thy lusts and thy desires and i will serve and satisfy them
begin charge me from thence or thence or in this line here is my centre ground thy quarrel
how child of wrath and anger
for what my sudden boy
nay that look you to i am afore hand
o this is no true grammar and as ill logic
you must render causes child your first and second intentions know your canons and your divisions moods degrees and differences your predicaments substance and accident series extern and intern with their causes efficient material formal final and have your elements perfect
the angry tongue he talks in
that false precept of being afore hand has deceived a number and made them enter quarrels often times before they were aware and afterward against their wills
how must i do then sir
i cry this lady mercy she should first have been saluted
i do call you lady because you are to be one ere't be long my soft and buxom widow
yes or my art is an egregious liar
by inspection on her forehead and subtlety of her lip which must be tasted often to make a judgment
'slight she melts like a myrobolane here is yet a line in rivo frontis tells me he is no knight
what is he then sir
let me see your hand
o your linea fortunae makes it plain and stella here in monte veneris
but most of all junctura annularis
he is a soldier or a man of art lady but shall have some great honour shortly
brother he's a rare man believe me
here comes the t'other rare man

please you to kuss her and be proud to know her
i shall be proud to know you lady
brother he calls me lady too
ay peace i heard it

'fore god she is a delicate dab chick

ay if your fortune will you must
come sir the captain will come to us presently i'll have you to my chamber of demonstrations where i will shew you both the grammar and logic and rhetoric of quarrelling my whole method drawn out in tables and my instrument that hath the several scales upon't shall make you able to quarrel at a straw's breadth by moon light
and lady i'll have you look in a glass some half an hour but to clear your eye sight against you see your fortune which is greater than i may judge upon the sudden trust me

a brain of a tailor
senores beso las manos a vuestras mercedes
would you had stoop'd a little and kist our anos
stab me i shall never hold man
he looks in that deep ruff like a head in a platter serv'd in by a short cloke upon two trestles
or what do you say to a collar of brawn cut down beneath the souse and wriggled with a knife
'slud he does look too fat to be a spaniard
perhaps some fleming or some hollander got him in d'alva's time count egmont's bastard

'sdeath and mammon must not be troubled
what shall we do then
think you must be sudden
entiendo que la senora es tan hermosa que codicio tan verla como la bien aventuranza de mi vida
'slid subtle he puts me in mind of the widow

"for after alexander's death" good lady "that perdiccas and antigonus were slain the two that stood seleuc' and ptolomee" madam "made up the two legs and the fourth beast that was gog north and egypt south which after was call'd gog iron leg and south iron leg" lady "and then gog horned
so was egypt too then egypt clay leg and gog clay leg" sweet madam "and last gog dust and egypt dust which fall in the last link of the fourth chain
and these be stars in story which none see or look at" what shall i do
"for" as he says "except we call the rabbins and the heathen greeks" dear lady "to come from salem and from athens and teach the people of great britain" what's the matter sir
"to speak the tongue of eber and javan" o she's in her fit
"we shall know nothing" death sir we are undone
"where then a learned linguist shall see the ancient used communion of vowels and consonants" my master will hear
wisdom which pythagoras held most high" sweet honourable lady
"to comprise all sounds of voices in few marks of letters" nay you must never hope to lay her now
"and so we may arrive by talmud skill and profane greek to raise the building up of helen's house against the ismaelite king of thogarma and his habergions brimstony blue and fiery and the force of king abaddon and the beast of cittim which rabbi david kimchi onkelos and aben ezra do interpret rome
" how did you put her into't
alas i talk'd of a fifth monarchy i would erect with the philosopher's stone by chance and she falls on the other four straight
i told you so
'slid stop her mouth
she'll never leave else
if the old man hear her we are but faeces ashes
what's to do there
o we are lost
now she hears him she is quiet
where shall i hide me
what sight is here
close deeds of darkness and that shun the light
o i have lived too long
nay good dear father there was no unchaste purpose
and flee me when i come in
that was my error
guilt guilt my son give it the right name
no marvel if i found check in our great work within when such affairs as these were managing
why have you so
it has stood still this half hour and all the rest of our less works gone back
where is the instrument of wickedness my lewd false drudge
nay good sir blame not him believe me 'twas against his will or knowledge i saw her by chance
will you commit more sin to excuse a varlet
by my hope 'tis true sir
nay then i wonder less if you for whom the blessing was prepared would so tempt heaven and lose your fortunes
this will retard the work a month at least
why if it do what remedy
but think it not good father our purposes were honest
as they were so the reward will prove
god and all saints be good to us
o sir we are defeated
all the works are flown in fumo every glass is burst furnace and all rent down as if a bolt of thunder had been driven through the house
retorts receivers pelicans bolt heads all struck in shivers
a help good sir
alas coldness and death invades him
nay sir mammon do the fair offices of a man
you stand as you were readier to depart than he
my lord her brother is come
his coach is at the door
avoid his sight for he's as furious as his sister's mad
my brain is quite undone with the fume sir i ne'er must hope to be mine own man again
is all lost lungs
will nothing be preserv'd of all our cost
faith very little sir a peck of coals or so which is cold comfort sir
o my voluptuous mind
i am justly punish'd
and so am i sir
cast from all my hopes nay certainties sir
by mine own base affections
o the curst fruits of vice and lust
good father it was my sin
hangs my roof over us still and will not fall o justice upon us for this wicked man

'twas here you learned t' anoint your boot with brimstone then rub men's gold on't for a kind of touch and say 'twas naught when you had changed the colour that you might have't for nothing
and this doctor your sooty smoky bearded compeer he will close you so much gold in a bolt's head and on a turn convey in the stead another with sublimed mercury that shall burst in the heat and fly out all in fumo
then weeps mammon then swoons his worship
or he is the faustus that casteth figures and can conjure cures plagues piles and pox by the ephemerides and holds intelligence with all the bawds and midwives of three shires while you send in captain
damsels with child wives that are barren or the waiting maid with the green sickness
nay sir you must tarry though he be scaped and answer by the ears sir
why now's the time if ever you will quarrel well as they say and be a true born child the doctor and your sister both are abused
he is a slave whate'er he is and the son of a whore
are you the man sir i would know
i should be loth sir to confess so much
then you lie in your throat
a very errant rogue sir and a cheater employ'd here by another conjurer that does not love the doctor and would cross him if he knew how
sir you are abused
you lie and 'tis no matter
he is the impudent'st rascal you are indeed will you hear me sir
by no means bid him be gone
lady do you inform your brother
there is not such a foist in all the town the doctor had him presently and finds yet the spanish count will come here
yes sir he must appear within this hour
and yet this rogue would come in a disguise by the temptation of another spirit to trouble our art though he could not hurt it

he is the lying'st swabber
come your ways sir
you are valiant out of company

and what does he owe for lotium
thirty shillings sir and for six syringes

why this is madness sir not valour in you i must laugh at this
it is my humour you are a pimp and a trig and an amadis de gaul or a don quixote
or a knight o' the curious coxcomb do you see
peace to the household
i'll keep peace for no man
casting of dollars is concluded lawful

you'll hear me sir
what is the motive
zeal in the young gentleman against his spanish slops
they are profane lewd superstitious and idolatrous breeches
will you begone sir
thou art not of the light that ruff of pride about thy neck betrays thee and is the same with that which the unclean birds in seventy seven were seen to prank it with on divers coasts thou look'st like antichrist in that lewd hat
i must give way
but i'll take a course with you depart proud spanish fiend
did i not quarrel bravely
nay an i give my mind to't i shall do't
o you must follow sir and threaten him tame he'll turn again else

goes puts it on himself
hast brought the damask

hast thou no credit with the players
yes sir did you never see me play the fool
i know not nab thou shalt if i can help it
hieronimo's old cloak ruff and hat will serve i'll tell thee more when thou bring'st 'em
sir i know the spaniard hates the brethren and hath spies upon their actions and that this was one i make no scruple
but the holy synod have been in prayer and meditation for it and 'tis revealed no less to them than me that casting of money is most lawful
but here i cannot do it if the house shou'd chance to be suspected all would out and we be locked up in the tower for ever to make gold there for the state never come out and then are you defeated
i will tell this to the elders and the weaker brethren that the whole company of the separation may join in humble prayer again
yea for some fitter place
the peace of mind rest with these walls
what did he come for
about casting dollars presently out of hand
and so i told him a spanish minister came here to spy against the faithful i conceive
come subtle thou art so down upon the least disaster
how wouldst thou ha' done if i had not help't thee out
i thank thee face for the angry boy i'faith
who would have look'd it should have been that rascal surly
he had dyed his beard and all
here's damask come to make you a suit
he is gone to borrow me a spanish habit i'll be the count now

'slight forty of the neighbours are about him talking
'tis he by this good day
'twill prove ill day for some on us
we are undone and taken

no 'twas within the walls
i thought the liberties

i'll into mine old shape again and meet him of jeremy the butler
in the mean time do you two pack up all the goods and purchase that we can carry in the two trunks
i'll keep him off for to day if i cannot longer and then at night i'll ship you both away to ratcliff where we will meet to morrow and there we'll share
let mammon's brass and pewter keep the cellar we'll have another time for that
but dol 'prythee go heat a little water quickly subtle must shave me all my captain's beard must off to make me appear smooth jeremy

and not cut my throat but trim me
you shall see sir

ay some as brave as lords
yes and oyster women
what should my knave advance to draw this company
he hung out no banners of a strange calf with five legs to be seen or a huge lobster with six claws
we had gone in then sir
he has no gift of teaching in the nose that e'er i knew of
you saw no bills set up that promised cure of agues or the tooth ach
no such thing sir
nor heard a drum struck for baboons or puppets
what device should he bring forth now
i love a teeming wit as i love my nourishment 'pray god he have not kept such open house that he hath sold my hangings and my bedding
i left him nothing else
if he have eat them a plague o' the moth say sure he has got some bawdy pictures to call all this ging
the friar and the nun or the new motion of the knight's courser covering the parson's mare or 't may be he has the fleas that run at tilt upon a table or some dog to dance
when saw you him
we saw him not this month
not these five weeks sir
these six weeks at the least
you amaze me neighbours
sure if your worship know not where he is he's slipt away
pray god he be not made away
it's no time to question then
about some three weeks since i heard a doleful cry as i sat up a mending my wife's stockings
'tis strange that none will answer
didst thou hear a cry sayst thou
yes sir like unto a man that had been strangled an hour and could not speak
i heard it too just this day three weeks at two o'clock next morning
these be miracles or you make them so
a man an hour strangled and could not speak and both you heard him cry
