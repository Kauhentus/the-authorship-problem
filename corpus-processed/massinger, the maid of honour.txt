a state room in the palace
good day to your lordship
may i presume to ask if the ambassador employ'd by ferdinand the duke of urbin hath audience this morning
'tis uncertain for though a counsellor of state i am not of the cabinet council but there's one if he please that may resolve you
i will move him
if you've a suit show water i am blind else
a suit yet of a nature not to prove the quarry that you hawk for if your words are not like indian wares and every scruple to be weigh'd and rated one poor syllable vouchsafed in answer of a fair demand cannot deserve a fee
it seems you are ignorant i neither speak nor hold my peace for nothing and yet for once i care not if i answer one single question gratis
i much thank you
hath the ambassador audience sir to day
i promised not so much
a syllable you begg'd my charity gave it move me no further
this you wonder at with me 'tis usual
pray you sir what is he
no gentleman yet a lord
he hath some drops of the king's blood running in his veins derived some ten degrees off
his revenue lies in a narrow compass the king's ear and yields him every hour a fruitful harvest
men may talk of three crops in a year in the fortunate islands or profit made by wool but while there are suitors his sheepshearing nay shaving to the quick is in every quarter of the moon and constant
in the time of trussing a point he can undo or make a man his play or recreation is to raise this up or pull down that and though he never yet took orders makes more bishops in sicily than the pope himself
enter and a servant
he in the malta habit is the king's natural brother
with this jewel presented to camiola prepare this night a visit for me
i shall have your company gallants i perceive if that the king will hear of war
you are sir a knight of malta and as i have heard have served against the turk
pray you show us the difference between the city valour and service in the field
'tis somewhat more than roaring in a tavern or a brothel or to steal a constable from a sleeping watch then burn their halberds or safe guarded by your tenant's sons to carry away a may pole from a neighbour village
you will not find there your masters of dependencies to take up a drunken brawl or to get you the names of valiant chevaliers fellows that will be for a cloak with thrice dyed velvet and a cast suit kick'd down the stairs
a knave with a provant sword if you bear not yourself both in and upright will slash your scarlets and your plush a new way or with the hilts thunder about your ears such music as will make your worships dance to the doleful tune of lachrym√¶
i must tell you in private as you are my princely friend i do not like such fiddlers
they are useful for your imitation i remember you when you came first to the court and talk'd of nothing but your rents and your entradas ever chiming the golden bells in your pockets you believed the taking of the wall as a tribute due to your gaudy clothes and could not walk at midnight without a causeless quarrel as if men of coarser outsides were in duty bound to suffer your affronts but when you had been cudgell'd well twice or thrice and from the doctrine made profitable uses you concluded the sovereign means to teach irregular heirs civility with conformity of manners were two or three sound beatings
i confess they did much good upon me
and on me the principles that they read were sound
you'll find the like instructions in the camp
enter ambassador and attendants
we sit prepared to hear
your majesty hath been long since familiar i doubt not with the desperate fortunes of my lord and pity of the much that your confederate hath suffer'd you being his last refuge may persuade you not alone to compassionate but to lend your royal aids to stay him in his fall to certain ruin
he too late is conscious that his ambition to encroach upon his neighbour's territories with the danger of his liberty nay his life hath brought in question his own inheritance but youth and heat of blood in your interpretation may both plead and mediate for him
i must grant it an error in him being denied the favours of the fair princess of sienna though he sought her in a noble way to endeavour to force affection by surprisal of her principal seat sienna
which now proves the seat of his captivity not triumph heaven is still just
and yet that justice is to be with mercy temper'd which heaven's deputies stand bound to minister
the injured duchess by reason taught as nature could not with the reparation of her wrongs but aim at a brave revenge and my lord feels too late that innocence will find friends
the great gonzaga the honour of his order i must praise virtue though in an enemy he whose fights and conquests hold one number rallying up her scatter'd troops before we could get time to victual or to man the conquer'd city sat down before it and presuming that 'tis not to be relieved admits no parley our flags of truce hung out in vain nor will he lend an ear to composition but exacts with the rendering up the town the goods and lives of all within the walls and of all sexes to be at his discretion
since injustice in your duke meets this correction can you press us with any seeming argument of reason in foolish pity to decline his dangers to draw them on ourself
shall we not be warn'd by his harms
the league proclaim'd between us bound neither of us further than to aid each other if by foreign force invaded and so far in my honour i was tied
but since without our counsel or allowance he hath ta'en arms with his good leave he must excuse us if we steer not on a rock we see and may avoid
let other monarchs contend to be made glorious by proud war and with the blood of their poor subjects purchase increase of empire and augment their cares in keeping that which was by wrongs extorted gilding unjust invasions with the trim of glorious conquests we that would be known the father of our people in our study and vigilance for their safety must not change their ploughshares into swords and force them from the secure shade of their own vines to be scorch'd with the flames of war or for our sport expose their lives to ruin
will you then in his extremity forsake your friend
no but preserve ourself
cannot the beams of honour thaw your icy fears
a kind of brother sir howe'er your subject your father's son and one who blushes that you are not heir to his brave spirit and vigour as to his kingdom
sir to be his living chronicle and to speak his praise cannot deserve your anger
where's your warrant for this presumption
here sir in my heart let sycophants that feed upon your favours style coldness in you caution and prefer your ease before your honour and conclude to eat and sleep supinely is the end of human blessings i must tell you sir virtue if not in action is a vice and when we move not forward we go backward nor is this peace the nurse of drones and cowards our health but a disease
well urged my lord
perfect what is so well begun
and bind my lord your servant
what reason canst thou infer to make this good
a thousand not to be contradicted
but consider where your command lies 'tis not sir in france spain germany portugal but in sicily an island sir
here are no mines of gold or silver to enrich you no worm spins silk in her womb to make distinction between you and a peasant in your habits no fish lives near our shores whose blood can dye scarlet or purple all that we possess with beasts we have in common nature did design us to be warriors and to break through our ring the sea by which we are environ'd and we by force must fetch in what is wanting or precious to us
add to this we are a populous nation and increase so fast that if we by our providence are not sent abroad in colonies or fall by the sword not sicily though now it were more fruitful than when 't was styled the granary of great rome can yield our numerous fry bread we must starve or eat up one another
the king hears with much attention
and seems moved with what bertoldo hath deliver'd
may you live long sir the king of peace so you deny not us the glory of the war let not our nerves shrink up with sloth nor for want of employment make younger brothers thieves it is their swords sir must sow and reap their harvest
if examples may move you more than arguments look on england the empress of the european isles and unto whom alone ours yields precedence when did she flourish so as when she was the mistress of the ocean her navies putting a girdle round about the world
when the iberian quaked her worthies named and the fair flower de luce grew pale set by the red rose and the white
let not our armour hung up or our unrigg'd armada make us ridiculous to the late poor snakes our neighbours warm'd in our bosoms and to whom again we may be terrible
rouse us sir from the sleep of idleness and redeem our mortgaged honours
your birth and justly claims my father's kingdom but his heroic mind descends to me i will confirm so much
in his looks he seems to break ope janus' temple
how these younglings take fire from him
it works an alteration upon the king
i can forbear no longer war war my sovereign
the king appears resolved and does prepare to speak
think not our counsel 's built upon so weak a base as to be overturn'd or shaken with tempestuous winds of words
as i my lord before resolved you i will not engage my person in this quarrel neither press my subjects to maintain it yet to show my rule is gentle and that i have feeling your master's sufferings since these gallants weary of the happiness of peace desire to taste the bitter sweets of war we do consent that as adventurers and volunteers no way compell'd by us they may make trial of their boasted valours
we desire no more
'tis well and but my grant in this expect not assistance from me
govern as you please the province you make choice of for i vow by all things sacred if that thou miscarry in this rash undertaking i will hear it no otherwise than as a sad disaster fallen on a stranger nor will i esteem that man my subject who in thy extremes in purse or person aids thee
take your fortune you know me i have said it
so my lord you have my absolute answer
my prince pays in me his duty
follow me fulgentio and you astutio
what a frown he threw at his departure on you
let him keep his smiles for his state flatterer i care not
shall we aboard to night
your speed my lord doubles the benefit
i have a business requires despatch some two hours hence i'll meet you
a room in camiola's house
enter signior walking fantastically followed by and cam
nay signior this is too much ceremony in my own house
what's gracious abroad must be in private practised
for your mirth's sake let him alone he has been all this morning in practice with a peruked gentleman usher to teach him his true amble and his postures walking by and practising
when he walks before a lady
you may madam perhaps believe that i in this use art to make you dote upon me by exposing my more than most rare features to your view but i as i have ever done deal simply
look not with too much contemplation on me if you do you are lost
what philters or love powders do you use to force affection
i see nothing in your person but i dare look on yet keep my own poor heart still
you are warn'd be arm'd and do not lose the hope of such a husband in being too soon enamour'd
never fear it though your best taking part your wealth were trebled i would not woo you
but since in your pity you please to give me caution tell me what temptations i must fly from
the first is that you never hear me sing for i'm a syren if you observe when i warble the dogs howl as ravish'd with my ditties and you will run mad to hear me
i will stop my ears and keep my little wits
next when i dance and come aloft thus capers cast not a sheep's eye upon the quivering of my calf
nor should your little ladyship be taken with my pretty spider fingers nor my eyes that twinkle on both sides
was there ever such a piece of motley heard of
exit you may spare the catalogue of my dangers
no good madam i have not told you half
re enter who is 't
the brother of the king
the brother of the king
is he no more
were it the king himself i'd give him leave to speak his mind to you for i am not jealous and to assure your ladyship of so much i'll usher him in and that done hide myself aside and exit
camiola if ever now be constant this is indeed a suitor whose sweet presence courtship and loving language would have stagger'd the chaste penelope and to increase the wonder did not modesty forbid it i should ask that from him he sues to me for and yet my reason like a tyrant tells me i must nor give nor take it
re enter with syl
i must tell you you lose your labour
yet you shall have my countenance to parley with her and i'll take special care that none shall interrupt you
come wench wilt thou hear wisdom
yes from you sir
if forcing this sweet favour from your hand kisses her hand
fair madam argue me of too much boldness when you are pleased to understand i take a parting kiss if not excuse at least 'twill qualify the offence
a parting kiss sir
what nation envious of the happiness which sicily enjoys in your sweet presence can buy you from her
or what climate yield pleasures transcending those which you enjoy here being both beloved and honour'd the north star and guider of all hearts and to sum up your full account of happiness in a word the brother of the king
do you alone and with an unexampled cruelty enforce my absence and deprive me of those blessings which you with a polish'd phrase seem to insinuate that i do possess and yet tax me as being guilty of my wilful exile
what are titles to me or popular suffrage or my nearness to the king in blood or fruitful sicily though it confess'd no sovereign but myself when you that are the essence of my being the anchor of my hopes the real substance of my felicity in your disdain turn all to fading and deceiving shadows
you tax me without cause
you must confess it
but answer love with love and seal the contract in the uniting of our souls how gladly though now i were in action and assured following my fortune that plumed victory would make her glorious stand upon my tent would i put off my armour in my heat of conquest and like antony pursue my cleopatra
will you yet look on me with an eye of favour
truth bear witness for me that in the judgment of my soul you are a man so absolute and circular in all those wish'd for rarities that may take a virgin captive that though at this instant all scepter'd monarchs of our western world were rivals with you and camiola worthy of such a competition you alone should wear the garland
if so what diverts your favour from me
no mulct in yourself or in your person mind or fortune
the consciousness of mine own wants alas
sir we are not parallels but like lines divided can ne'er meet in one centre
your birth sir without addition were an ample dowry for one of fairer fortunes and this shape were you ignoble far above all value to this so clear a mind so furnish'd with harmonious faculties moulded from heaven that though you were thersites in your features of no descent and irus in your fortunes ulysses like you'd force all eyes and ears to love but seen and when heard wonder at your matchless story but all these bound up together in one volume
give me leave with admiration to look upon them but not presume in my own flattering hopes i may or can enjoy them
in the pro√´me to herbert's travels which were printed not long after the maid of honour a similar expression is found "great britaine containes the summe and abridge of all sorts of excellencies met here like parallels in their proper centre
" in the life of dr
more there is a letter to a correspondent who had sent him a pious treatise in which the same expression occurs and is thus noticed by the doctor "there is but one passage that i remember which will afford them the profane and atheistical rout of the age a disingenuous satisfaction which is in p
where you say that straight lines drawn from the centre run parallel together
to a candid reader your intended sense can be no other than that they run greek par all√™las that is by one another which they may do though they do not run all along equidistantly one by another which is the mathematical sense of the word parallel
the good doctor is i think the best critic on the subject that has yet appeared and sufficiently explains massinger
how you ruin what you would seem to build up
i know no disparity between us you're an heir sprung from a noble family fair rich young and every way my equal
sir excuse me one aerie with proportion ne'er discloses the eagle and the wren tissue and frieze in the same garment monstrous
but suppose that what 's in you excessive were diminish'd and my desert supplied the stronger bar religion stops our entrance you are sir a knight of malta by your order bound to a single life you cannot marry me and i assure myself you are too noble to seek me though my frailty should consent in a base path
a dispensation lady will easily absolve me
o take heed sir
when what is vow'd to heaven is dispensed with to serve our ends on earth a curse must follow and not a blessing
is there no hope left me
nor to myself but is a neighbour to impossibility
true love should walk on equal feet in us it does not sir but rest assured excepting this i shall be devoted to your service
and this is your determinate sentence
not to be revoked
farewell then fairest cruel
all thoughts in me of women perish
let the glorious light of noble war extinguish love's dim taper
that only lends me light to see my folly honour be thou my ever living mistress and fond affection as thy bond slave serve thee
how soon my sun is set he being absent never to rise again
what a fierce battle is fought between my passions
i perceive he has his answer now must i step in to comfort her
you have found i hope sweet lady some difference between a youth of my pitch and this bugbear bertoldo
despair not i may be in time entreated
be so now to leave me
lights for my chamber
a room in the palace
embark'd to night do you say
i saw him aboard sir
and without taking of his leave
are we grown so contemptible
'tis far from me sir to add fuel to your anger that in your ill opinion of him burns too hot already else i should affirm it was a gross neglect
a wilful scorn of duty and allegiance you give it too fair a name but we shall think on 't
can you guess what the numbers were that follow'd him in his desperate action
more than you think sir
all ill affected spirits in palermo or to your government or person with the turbulent swordmen such whose poverty forced them to wish a change are gone along with him creatures devoted to his undertakings in right or wrong and to express their zeal and readiness to serve him ere they went profanely took the sacrament on their knees to live and die with him
their loyalty to us forgot
unthankful as they are
yet this deserves not one troubled thought in you sir with your pardon i hold that their remove from hence makes more for your security than danger
true and as i'll fashion it they shall feel it too
astutio you shall presently be despatch'd with letters writ and sign'd with our own hand to the duchess of sienna in excuse of our part in these forces sent against her
you must beside from us take some instructions to be imparted as you judge them useful to the general gonzaga
instantly prepare you for your journey
with the wings of loyalty and duty
i am bold to put your majesty in mind rob
of my promise and aids to further you in your amorous project to the fair and rich camiola
there's my ring whatever you shall say that i entreat or can command by power i will make good
ever your majesty's creature
venus prove propitious to you
all sorts to my wishes bertoldo was my hindrance he removed i now will court her in the conqueror's style "come see and overcome
haste to camiola bid her prepare an entertainment suitable to a fortune she could not hope for
tell her i vouchsafe to honour her with a visit
'tis a favour will make her proud
i am gone sir
entreaties fit not me a man in grace may challenge awe and privilege by his place
a room in camiola's house
so melancholy say you
never given to such retirement
can you guess the cause
if it hath not its birth and being from the brave bertoldo's absence i confess 'tis past my apprehension
you are wide the whole field wide
i in my understanding pity your ignorance
know here walks the cause
she dares not look upon me my beauties are so terrible and enchanting she cannot endure my sight
there i believe you
but the time will come be comforted when i will put off this vizor of unkindness to her and show an amorous and yielding face and until then though hercules himself desire to see her he had better eat his club than pass her threshold for i will be her cerberus to guard her
keep you open house here
no groom to attend a gentleman
o i spy one
he means not me i am sure
you sirrah sheep's head with a face cut on a cat stick do you hear
you yeoman fewterer conduct me to the lady of the mansion or my poniard shall disembogue thy soul
i talk'd of hercules and here is one bound up in decimo sexto
pray you little gentleman be not so furious the lady keeps her chamber
and we present sent on an embassy to her
but here is her gentlewoman
hold my cloak while i take a leap at her lips do it and neatly or having first tripp'd up thy heels i'll make thy back my footstool
am i turn'd turk
what an office am i put to
my lady gentle youth is indisposed
though she were dead and buried only tell her the great man in the court the brave fulgentio descends to visit her and it will raise her out of the grave for joy
the devil i fear in his holiday clothes
my part is at an end then
cover my shoulders when i grow great thou shalt serve me
are you sirrah an implement of the house
sure he will make a jointstool of me
or if you belong to to the lady of the place command her hither
i do not wear her livery yet acknowledge a duty to her and as little bound to serve your peremptory will as she is to obey your summons
'twill become you sir to wait her leisure then her pleasure known you may present your duty
slave i'll teach you manners
i'm past learning make not a tumult in the house
shall i be braved thus
what insolence is this
adorni hold hold i command you
not so sir however in his life he had dependence upon my father he's a gentleman as well born as yourself
put on your hat
in my presence without leave
he has mine madam
and i must tell you sir and in plain language howe'er your glittering outside promise gentry the rudeness of your carriage and behaviour speaks you a coarser thing
she means a clown sir i am her interpreter for want of a better
i am a queen in mine own house nor must you expect an empire here
sure i must love her before the day the pretty soul's so valiant
and what would you with me
proud one when you know what i am and what i came for and may on your submission proceed to you in your reason must repent the coarseness of my entertainment
a kinsman of the king's
i cry you mercy for his sake not your own
but grant you are so 'tis not impossible but a king may have a fool to his kinsman no way meaning you sir
you have heard of fulgentio
long since sir a suit broker in court
he has the worst report among good men i ever heard of for bribery and extortion in their prayers widows and orphans curse him for a canker and caterpillar in the state
i hope sir you are not the man
i reply not as you deserve being assured you know me pretending ignorance of my person only to give me a taste of your wit 'tis well and courtly i like a sharp wit well
i cannot endure it nor any of the syllis
more i know too this harsh induction must serve as a foil to the well tuned observance and respect you will hereafter pay me being made familiar with my credit with the king and that contain your joy i deign to love you
i am not rapt with it
hear 't again i love you honestly now you admire me
i do indeed it being a word so seldom heard from a courtier's mouth
but pray you deal plainly since you find me simple what might be the motives inducing you to leave the freedom of a bachelor's life on your soft neck to wear the stubborn yoke of marriage and of all the beauties in palermo to choose me poor me
that is the main point you must treat of
why i will tell you
of a little thing you are a pretty peat indifferent fair too and like a new rigg'd ship both tight and yare besides the quickness of your eye assures an active spirit
you are pleasant sir yet i presume that there was one thing in me unmention'd yet that took you more than all those parts you have remember'd
you are in the right without that beauty is a flower worn in the morning at night trod on but beauty youth and fortune meeting in you i will vouchsafe to marry you
you speak well and in return excuse me sir if i deliver reasons why upon no terms i'll marry you i fable not
i am glad to hear this i began to have an ague
come your wise reasons
such as they are pray take them first i am doubtful whether you are a man since for your shape trimm'd up in a lady's dressing you might pass for a woman for the fairness of your complexion which you think will take me the colour i must tell you in a man is weak and faint and never will hold out if put to labour give me the lovely brown a thick curl'd hair of the same die a leg without an artificial calf i suspect yours but let that pass
she means me all this while for i have every one of those good parts o sylli
you are moved sir
then as you are a courtier a graced one too i fear you have been too forward and so much for your person
one word more and i have done
i'll ease you of the trouble coy and disdainful
save me or else he'll beat me
no your own folly shall and since you put me to my last charm look upon this and tremble
shows the king's ring
at the sight of a fair ring
the king's i take it
i have seen him wear the like if he hath sent it as a favour to me ful
yes 'tis very likely his dying mother's gift prized as his crown
by this he does command you to be mine by his gift you are so you may yet redeem all
you are in a wrong account still
though the king may dispose of my life and goods my mind's mine own and never shall be yours
the king heaven bless him
is good and gracious and will not compel his subjects against their wills
i believe forgetting it when he wash'd his hands you stole it with an intent to awe me
but you are cozen'd i am still myself and will be
a proud haggard and not to be reclaim'd
which of your grooms your coachman fool or footman is the lover preferr'd before me
you are foul mouth'd
much fairer than thy black soul and so i will proclaim thee
were i a man thou durst not speak this
heaven so prosper me as i resolve to do it to all men and in every place scorn'd by a tit of ten pence
now i begin to be valiant nay i will draw my sword
o for a brother
do a friend's part pray you carry him the length of 't
i give him three years and a day to match my toledo and then we'll fight like dragons
i may live to have vengeance my bertoldo would not have heard this
pray you spare your language
prithee fool and make me merry
that is my office ever
i must do not talk this glorious gallant shall hear from me
a camp before the walls of sienna
chambers shot off a flourish as to an assault after which enter and soldiers
is the breach made assaultable
yes and the moat fill'd up the cannoneer hath done his parts we may enter six abreast
there's not a man dares show himself upon the wall
defeat not the soldiers' hoped for spoil
if you sir delay the assault and the city be given up to your discretion you in honour cannot use the extremity of war but in compassion to them you to us prove cruel
and an enemy to yourself
a hindrance to the brave revenge you have vow'd
temper your heat and lose not by too sudden rashness that which be but patient will be offer'd to you
security ushers ruin proud contempt of an enemy three parts vanquish'd with desire and greediness of spoil have often wrested a certain victory from the conqueror's gripe
discretion is the tutor of the war
valour the pupil and when we command with lenity and our direction's follow'd with cheerfulness a prosperous end must crown our works well undertaken
ours are finish'd pier
if we make use of fortune
her false smiles deprive you of your judgments
the condition of our affairs exacts a double care and like bifronted janus we must look backward as forward though a flattering calm bids us urge on a sudden tempest raised not feared much less expected in our rear may foully fall upon us and distract us to our confusion
enter a scout hastily
what brings thy ghastly looks and sudden speed
the assurance of a new enemy
this i foresaw and fear'd
what are they know'st thou
they are by their colours sicilians bravely mounted and the brightness of their rich armours doubly gilded with reflection of the sun
the king in league
'tis foul but this must be prevented not disputed
your estridge plumes that but even now like quills of porcupines seem'd to threaten the stars drop at the rumour of a shower and like to captive colours sweep the earth
bear up but in great dangers greater minds are never proud
shall a few loose troops untrain'd but in a customary ostentation presented as a sacrifice to your valours cause a dejection in you
however startled where you lead we'll follow
we will not stay their charge but meet them man to man and horse to horse
pierio in our absence hold our place and with our foot men and those sickly troops prevent a sally i in mine own person with part of the cavallery will bid these hunters welcome to a bloody breakfast but i lose time
i'll to my charge
and we to ours i'll bring you on
if we come off it's not amiss if not my state is settled
the citadel of sienna
enter and on the walls
no aids from sicily
hath hope forsook us and that vain comfort to affliction pity by our vow'd friend denied us
we can nor live nor die with honour like beasts in a toil we wait the leisure of the bloody hunter who is not so far reconciled unto us as in one death to give a period to our calamities but in delaying the fate we cannot fly from starved with wants we die this night to live again to morrow and suffer greater torments
there is not three days' provision for every soldier at an ounce of bread a day left in the city
to die the beggar's death with hunger made anatomies while we live cannot but crack our heart strings with vexation
would they would break break altogether
how willingly like cato could i tear out my bowels rather than look on the conqueror's insulting face but that religion and the horrid dream to be suffer'd in the other world denies it
what news with thee
from the turret of the fort by the rising clouds of dust through which like lightning the splendour of bright arms sometimes brake through i did descry some forces making towards us and from the camp as emulous of their glory the general for i know him by his horse and bravely seconded encounter'd them
their greetings were too rough for friends their swords and not their tongues exchanging courtesies
by this the main battalias are join'd and if you please to be spectators of the horrid issue i will bring you where as in a theatre you may see their fates in purple gore presented
heaven if yet thou art appeased for my wrong done to aurelia take pity of my miseries
lead the way friend
a plain near the camp
a long charge after which a flourish for victory then enter and wounded and prisoners
we have them yet though they cost us dear
this was charged home and bravely follow'd
be to yourselves to and true mirrors to each other's worth and looking with noble emulation on his wounds points to the glorious livery of triumphant war imagine these with equal grace appear upon yourselves
the bloody sweat you have suffer'd in this laborious nay toilsome harvest yields a rich crop of conquest and the spoil most precious balsam to a soldier's hurts will ease and cure them
let me look upon and are brought forward
oh how much transform'd from what they were
were these toys fashion'd to undergo the burthen of thy service
the weight of their defensive armour bruised their weak effeminate limbs and would have forced them in a hot day without a blow to yield
this insultation shows not manly in you
to men i had forborne it you are women or at the best loose carpet knights
what fury seduced you to exchange your ease in court for labour in the field
perhaps you thought to charge through dust and blood an armed foe was but like graceful running at the ring for a wanton mistress' glove and the encounter a soft impression on her lips but you are gaudy butterflies and i wrong myself in parling with you
now we prove it
but here's one fashion'd in another mould and made of tougher metal
true i owe him for this wound bravely given
o that mountains were heap'd upon me that i might expire a wretch no more remember'd
look up sir to be o'ercome deserves no shame
if you had fallen ingloriously or could accuse your want of courage in resistance 'twere to be lamented but since you perform'd as much as could be hoped for from a man fortune his enemy you wrong yourself in this dejection
i am honour'd in my victory over you but to have these my prisoners is in my true judgment rather captivity than a triumph you shall find fair quarter from me and your many wounds which i hope are not mortal with such care look'd to and cured as if your nearest friend attended on you
when you know me better you will make void this promise can you call me into your memory
a brother of our order
john our holy patron i am more amazed nay thunderstruck with thy apostacy and precipice from the most solemn vows made unto heaven when this the glorious badge of our redeemer was conferred upon thee by the great master than if i had seen a reprobate jew an atheist turk or tartar baptized in our religion
this i look'd for and am resolved to suffer
fellow soldiers behold this man and taught by his example know that 'tis safer far to play with lightning than trifle in things sacred
in my rage weeps
i shed these at the funeral of his virtue faith and religion why i will tell you he was a gentleman so train'd up and fashion'd for noble uses and his youth did promise such certainties more than hopes of great achievements as if the christian world had stood opposed against the othoman race to try the fortune of one encounter this bertoldo had been for his knowledge to direct and matchless courage to execute without a rival by the votes of good men chosen general as the prime soldier and most deserving of all that wear the cross which now in justice i thus tear from him
let me die with it upon my breast
no by this thou wert sworn on all occasions as a knight to guard weak ladies from oppression and never to draw thy sword against them whereas thou in hope of gain or glory when a princess and such a princess as aurelia is was dispossess'd by violence of what was her true inheritance against thine oath hast to thy uttermost labour'd to uphold her falling enemy
but thou shalt pay a heavy forfeiture and learn too late valour employ'd in an ill quarrel turns to cowardice and virtue then puts on foul vice's visor
this is that which cancels all friendship's bands between us
bear them off i will hear no reply and let the ransom of these for they are yours be highly rated
in this i do but right and let it be styled justice and not wilful cruelty
a term of contempt very frequently used by our old writers
carpet knights were such as were made on occasion of public festivities marriages births &c
in contradistinction to those that were created on the field of battle after a victory
they were naturally little regarded by the latter and indeed their title had long been given in scorn to effeminate courtiers favourites &c
a camp before the walls of sienna
what i have done sir by the law of arms i can and will make good
i have no commission to expostulate the act
these letters speak the king my master's love to you and his vow'd service to the duchess on whose person i am to give attendance
at this instant she's at fienza you may spare the trouble of riding thither i have advertised her of our success and on what humble terms sienna stands though presently i can possess it i defer it that she may enter her own and as she please dispose of the prisoners and the spoil
i thank you sir
in the mean time if i may have your licence i have a nephew and one once my ward for whose liberties and ransoms i would gladly make composition
they are as i take it call'd gasparo and antonio
for them you must treat with these but for bertoldo he is mine own if the king will ransom him he pays down fifty thousand crowns if not he lives and dies my slave
pray you a word aside to the king will rather thank you to detain him than give one crown to free him
i'll send the prisoners under guard my business calls me another way
my service waits you
now gentlemen for this ransom since you are not to be brought lower there is no evading i'll be your paymaster
we desire no better
but not a word of what's agreed between us till i have school'd my gallants
i am dumb sir
enter a guard with and in irons
and where removed now
hath the tyrant found out worse usage for us
worse it cannot be
my greyhound has fresh straw and scraps in his kennel but we have neither
did i ever think to wear such garters on silk stockings
or that my too curious appetite that turn'd at the sight of godwits pheasant partridge quails larks woodcocks calver'd salmon as coarse diet would leap at a mouldy crust
and go without it so oft as i do
how have i jeer'd the city entertainment
a huge shoulder of glorious fat ram mutton seconded with a pair of tame cats or conies a crab tart with a worthy loin of veal and valiant capon mortified to grow tender
these i scorn'd from their plentiful horn of abundance though invited but now i could carry my own stool to a tripe and call their chitterlings charity and bless the founder
o that i were no further sensible of my miseries than you are
you like beasts feel only stings of hunger and complain not but when you're empty but your narrow souls if you have any cannot comprehend how insupportable the torments are which a free and noble soul made captive suffers
and what am i then that envy you
fetters though made of gold express base thraldom and all delicates prepared by median cooks for epicures when not our own are bitter quilts fill'd high with gossamere and roses cannot yield the body soft repose the mind kept waking with anguish and affliction
my good lord bert
this is no time nor place for flattery sir pray you style me as i am a wretch forsaken of the world as myself
i would it were in me to help you
if that you want power sir lip comfort cannot cure me
pray you leave me to mine own private thoughts
and my more than warlike ward
i am glad to see you after your glorious conquests
are these chains rewards for your good service
if they are you should wear them on your necks since they are massy like aldermen of the war
you jeer us too
good uncle name not as you are a man of honour that fatal word of war the very sound of it is more dreadful than a cannon
but redeem us from this captivity and i'll vow hereafter never to wear a sword or cut my meat with a knife that has an edge or point i'll starve first
well have more wit hereafter for this time you are ransom'd
off with their irons
do do if you are ours again you know your price
pray you despatch us i shall ne'er believe i am a free man till i set my foot in sicily again and drink palermo and in palermo too
the wind sits fair you shall aboard to night with the rising sun you may touch upon the coast
but take your leaves of the late general first
i will be brief
and my lord heaven keep you
yours to use in the way of peace but as your soldiers never
a pox of war
no more of war
have you authority to loose their bonds yet leave the brother of your king whose worth disdains comparison with such as these in irons
if ransom may redeem them i have lands a patrimony of mine own assign'd me by my deceased sire to satisfy whate'er can be demanded for my freedom
i wish you had sir but the king who yields no reason for his will in his displeasure hath seized on all you had nor will gonzaga whose prisoner now you are accept of less than fifty thousand crowns
i find it now that misery never comes alone
but grant the king is yet inexorable time may work him to a feeling of my sufferings
i have friends that swore their lives and fortunes were at my devotion and among the rest yourself my lord when forfeited to the law for a foul murder and in cold blood done i made your life my gift and reconciled you to this incensed king and got your pardon
i know you are rich and may pay down the sum
i might my lord but pardon me
and will astutio prove then to please a passionate man the king's no more false to his maker and his reason which commands more than i ask
o summer friendship whose flattering leaves that shadow'd us in our prosperity with the least gust drop off in the autumn of adversity
how like a prison is to a grave
when dead we are with solemn pomp brought thither and our heirs masking their joy in false dissembled tears weep o'er the herse but earth no sooner covers the earth brought thither but they turn away with inward smiles the dead no more remember'd so enter'd in a prison ast
my occasions command me hence my lord
pray you leave me do and tell the cruel king that i will wear these fetters till my flesh and they are one incorporated substance
exit in myself as in a glass i'll look on human frailty and curse the height of royal blood since i in being born near to jove am near his thunder
cedars once shaken with a storm their own weight grubs their roots out
lead me where you please i am his not fortune's martyr and will die the great example of his cruelty
a grove near the palace
he undergoes my challenge and contemns it and threatens me with the late edict made 'gainst duellists the altar cowards fly to
but i that am engaged and nourish in me a higher aim than fair camiola dreams of must not sit down thus
in the court i dare not attempt him and in public he's so guarded with a herd of parasites clients fools and suitors that a musket cannot reach him my designs admit of no delay
this is her birthday which with a fit and due solemnity camiola celebrates and on it all such as love or serve her usually present a tributary duty
i'll have something to give if my intelligence prove true shall find acceptance
i am told near this grove fulgentio every morning makes his markets with his petitioners i may present him with a sharp petition
'tis he my fate be ever bless'd for 't
command such as wait me not to presume at the least for half an hour to press on my retirements
'tis well and by a groom
was this shape made to fight
i have a tongue yet howe'er no sword to kill him and what way this morning i'll resolve of
i shall cross your resolution or suffer for you
a room in camiola's house
enter followed by servants with presents and syl
what are all these
servants with several presents and rich ones too
with her best wishes madam of many such days to you the lady petula presents you with this fan
this diamond from your aunt honoria
this piece of plate from your uncle old vicentio with your arms graven upon it
good friends they are too munificent in their love and favour to me
out of my cabinet return such jewels as this directs you to for your pains and yours nor must you be forgotten
honour me with the drinking of a health
gold on my life
she scorns to give base silver
would she had been born every month in the year
show such another maid
all happiness wait you
i'll see your will done
a scratch got in your service else not worth your observation i bring not madam in honour of your birthday antique plate or pearl for which the savage indian dives into the bottom of the sea nor diamonds hewn from steep rocks with danger
such as give to those that have what they themselves want aim at a glad return with profit yet despise not my offering at the altar of your favour nor let the lowness of the giver lessen the height of what's presented since it is a precious jewel almost forfeited and dimm'd with clouds of infamy redeem'd and in its natural splendour with addition restored to the true owner
not to hold you in suspense i bring you madam your wounded reputation cured the sting of virulent malice festering your fair name pluck'd out and trod on
that proud man that was denied the honour of your hand yet durst with his untrue reports revile your fame compell'd by me hath given himself the lie and in his own blood wrote it you may read fulgentio subscribed
it does deserve it madam
common service is fit for hinds and the reward proportion'd to their conditions therefore look not on me as a follower of your father's fortunes or one that subsists on yours you frown
my service merits not this asp√©ct
which of my favours i might say bounties hath begot and nourish'd this more than rude presumption
since you had an itch to try your desperate valour wherefore went you not to the war
couldst thou suppose my innocence could ever fall so low as to have need of thy rash sword to guard it against malicious slander
o how much those ladies are deceived and cheated when the clearness and integrity of their actions do not defend themselves and stand secure on their own bases
such as in a colour of seeming service give protection to them betray their own strengths
malice scorn'd puts out itself but argued gives a kind of credit to a false accusation
in this this your most memorable service you believed you did me right but you have wrong'd me more in your defence of my undoubted honour than false fulgentio could
i am sorry what was so well intended is so ill received re enter yet under your correction you wish'd bertoldo had been present
true i did but he and you sir are not parallels nor must you think yourself so
i am what you'll please to have me
if bertoldo had punish'd fulgentio's insolence it had shown his love to her whom in his judgment he vouchsafed to make his wife a height i hope which you dare not aspire to
the same actions suit not all men alike but i perceive repentance in your looks
for this time leave me i may forgive perhaps forget your folly conceal yourself till this storm be blown over
you will be sought for yet if my estate gives him her hand to kiss
can hinder it shall not suffer in my service
exit this gentleman is of a noble temper and i too harsh perhaps in my reproof was i not clarinda
i am not to censure your actions madam but there are a thousand ladies and of good fame in such a cause would be proud of such a servant
it may be enter a servant
let me offend in this kind
the signiors madam gasparo and antonio selected friends of the renown'd bertoldo put ashore this morning
never think more then
they have been at court kiss'd the king's hand and their first duties done to him appear ambitious to tender to you their second service
fear do not rack me
reason now if ever haste with thy aids and tell me such a wonder as my bertoldo is with such care fashion'd must not nay cannot in heaven's providence enter and so soon miscarry
pray you forbear ere you take the privilege as strangers to salute me excuse my manners make me first understand how it is with bertoldo
the relation will not i fear deserve your thanks
i wish some other should inform you
you see though with some fear i dare inquire it
would that were the worst a debt were paid then kings in their birth owe nature
is there aught more terrible than death
yes to a spirit like his cruel imprisonment and that without the hope of freedom
you abuse me the royal king cannot in love to virtue though all springs of affection were dried up but pay his ransom
when you know what 'tis you will think otherwise no less will do it than fifty thousand crowns
a petty sum the price weigh'd with the purchase fifty thousand
to the king 'tis nothing
he that can spare more to his minion for a masque cannot but ransom such a brother at a million
you wrong the king's magnificence
in your opinion but 'tis most certain he does not alone in himself refuse to pay it but forbids all other men
are you sure of this
you may read the edict to that purpose publish'd by him that will resolve you
pray you stand off
if i do not mutter treason to myself my heart will break and yet i will not curse him he is my king
the news you have deliver'd makes me weary of your company we'll salute when we meet next
i'll bring you to the door
nay pray you no more compliments
one thing more and that's substantial let your adorni look to himself
the king is much incensed against him for fulgentio
as i am for your slowness to depart
o more than impious times
when not alone subordinate ministers of justice are corrupted and seduced but kings themselves the greater wheels by which the lesser move are broken or disjointed
could it be else a king to sooth his politic ends should so far forsake his honour as at once to break the adamant chains of nature and religion to bind up atheism as a defence to his dark counsels
will it ever be that to deserve too much is dangerous and virtue when too eminent a crime
must she serve fortune still or when stripp'd of her gay and glorious favours lose the beauties of her own natural shape
o my bertoldo thou only sun in honour's sphere how soon art thou eclipsed and darken'd
not the nearness of blood prevailing on the king nor all the benefits to the general good dispensed gaining a retribution
but that to owe a courtesy to a simple virgin would take from the deserving i find in me some sparks of fire which fann'd with honour's breath might rise into a flame and in men darken their usurp'd splendour
my aim is high and for the honour of my sex to fall so can never prove inglorious
'tis resolved call in adorni
i am happy in such an employment madam
he's a man i know that at a reverent distance loves me and such are ever faithful
what a sea of melting ice i walk on
what strange censures am i to undergo
but good intents deride all future rumours
re enter with ador
i obey your summons madam
leave the place clarinda one woman in a secret of such weight wise men may think too much exit nearer adorni
i warrant it with a smile
i cannot ask safer protection what's your will
to doubt your ready desire to serve me or prepare you with the repetition of former merits would in my diffidence wrong you but i will and without circumstance in the trust that i impose upon you free you from suspicion
i foster none of you
i know you do not
you are adorni by the love you owe me ador
take me with you
love born of duty but advance no further
you are sir as i said to do me service to undertake a task in which your faith judgment discretion in a word your all that's good must be engaged nor must you study in the execution but what may make for the ends i aim at
they admit no rivals
you have heard of bertoldo's captivity and the king's neglect the greatness of his ransom fifty thousand crowns adorni two parts of my estate
to what tends this
yet i so love the gentleman for to you i will confess my weakness that i purpose now when he is forsaken by the king and his own hopes to ransom him and receive him into my bosom as my lawful husband why change you colour
'tis in wonder of your virtue madam
you must therefore to sienna for me and pay to gonzaga this ransom for his liberty you shall have bills of exchange along with you
let him swear a solemn contract to me for you must be my principal witness if he should but why do i entertain these jealousies
you will do this
faithfully madam but not live long after
one thing i had forgot besides his freedom he may want accomodations furnish him according to his birth
i'll instantly despatch you
was there ever poor lover so employ'd against himself to make way for his rival
i must do it nay more i will
if loyalty can find recompense beyond hope or imagination let it fall on me in the other world as a reward for in this i dare not hope it
a camp before the walls of sienna
you have seized upon the citadel and disarm'd all that could make resistance
hunger had done that before we came nor was the soldier compell'd to seek for prey the famish'd wretches in hope of mercy as a sacrifice offer'd all that was worth the taking
where is the duke of urbin
under guard as you directed
see the soldiers set in rank and file and as the duchess passes bid them vail their ensigns
enter and under a canopy
presents her with letters
but for these aids from sicily sent against us to blast our spring of conquest in the bud i cannot find my lord ambassador how we should entertain 't but as a wrong with purpose to detain us from our own howe'er the king endeavours in his letters to mitigate the affront
your grace hereafter may hear from me such strong assurances of his unlimited desires to serve you as will i hope drown in forgetfulness the memory of what's past
we shall take time to search the depth of 't further and proceed as our council shall direct us
we present you with the keys of the city all lets are removed your way is smooth and easy at your feet your proudest enemy falls
we thank your valours a victory without blood is twice achieved and the disposure of it to us tender'd the greatest honour
my love extends itself to all
a guard drawn up passes through them
a room in the prison
is discovered in fetters reading
'tis here determined great examples arm'd with arguments produced to make it good that neither tyrants nor the wrested laws the people's frantic rage sad exile want nor that which i endure captivity can do a wise man any injury
thus seneca when he wrote it thought
but then felicity courted him his wealth exceeding a private man's happy in the embraces of his chaste wife paulina his house full of children clients servants flattering friends soothing his lip positions and created prince of the senate by the general voice at his new pupil's suffrage then no doubt he held and did believe this
but no sooner the prince's frowns and jealousies had thrown him out of security's lap and a centurion had offer'd him what choice of death he pleased but told him die he must when straight the armour of his so boasted fortitude fell off throws away the book
complaining of his frailty
can it then be censured womanish weakness in me if thus clogg'd with irons and the period to close up all calamities denied me which was presented seneca i wish i ne'er had being at least never knew what happiness was or argue with heaven's justice tearing my locks and in defiance throwing dust in the air
or falling on the ground thus with my nails and teeth to dig a grave or rend the bowels of the earth my step mother and not a natural parent
or thus practise to die and as i were insensible believe i had no motion
falls on his face
there he is i'll not inquire by whom his ransom's paid i am satisfied that i have it nor allege one reason to excuse his cruel usage as you may interpret it let it suffice it was my will to have it so
he is yours now dispose of him as you please
howe'er i hate him as one preferr'd before me being a man he does deserve my pity
he sleeps or he is dead
come near and if 't be possible without his feeling take off his irons
his irons taken off
so now leave us private
he does begin to stir and as transported with a joyful dream how he stares
and feels his legs as yet uncertain whether it can be true or fantastical
ministers of mercy mock not calamity
or if it be the happiest that ever appear'd to sinful flesh
his face speaks him adorni but some glorious angel concealing its divinity in his shape hath done this miracle it being not an act for wolfish man
resolve me if thou look'st for bent knees in adoration
i am adorni and the instrument of your deliverance but the benefit you owe another
if he has a name as soon as spoken 'tis writ on my heart i am his bondman
to the shame of men this great act is a woman's
the whole sex for her sake must be deified
how i wander in my imagination yet cannot guess who this phoenix should be
pray you speak 't again there's music in her name
once more i pray you sir
cursed atheist that i was only to doubt it could be any other since she alone in the abstract of herself that small but ravishing substance comprehends whatever is or can be wish'd in the idea of a woman
o what service or sacrifice of duty can i pay her if not to live and die her charity's slave which is resolved already
she expects not such a dominion o'er you
you must now which is the sum of all that she desires by a solemn contract bind yourself when she requires it as a debt due for your freedom to marry her
this does engage me further a payment
an increase of obligation
'twas my nil ultra ever the end of my ambition
o that now the holy man she present were prepared to join our hands but with that speed my heart wishes mine eyes might see her
you must swear this
shall i now begin my vows to you
i am no churchman such a one must file it on record you are free and that you may appear like to yourself for so she wish'd here's gold with which you may redeem your trunks and servants and whatever of late you lost
i have found out the captain whose spoil they were his name is roderigo
i have done my parts
so much sir as i am ever yours for 't
now methinks i walk in air
divine camiola but words cannot express thee i'll build to thee an altar in my soul on which i'll offer a still increasing sacrifice of duty
what will become of me now is apparent
this roman resolution of self murder will not hold water at the high tribunal when it comes to be argued my good genius prompts me to this consideration
he that kills himself to avoid misery fears it and at the best shows but a bastard valour
this life's a fort committed to my trust which i must not yield up till it be forced nor will he's not valiant that dares die but he that boldly bears calamity
a state room in the palace
a seat here for the duke
it is our glory to overcome with courtesies not rigour the lordly roman who held it the height of human happiness to have kings and queens to wait by his triumphant chariot wheels in his insulting pride deprived himself of drawing near the nature of the gods best known for such in being merciful
yet give me leave but still with gentle language and with the freedom of a friend to tell you to seek by force what courtship could not win was harsh and never taught in love's mild school
wise poets feign that venus' coach is drawn by doves and sparrows not by bears and tigers
i spare the application
in my fortune heaven's justice hath confirm'd it yet great lady since my offence grew from excess of love and not to be resisted having paid too with loss of liberty the forfeiture of my presumption in your clemency it may find pardon
you shall have just cause to say it hath
the charge of the long siege defray'd and the loss my subjects have sustain'd made good since so far i must deal with caution you have your liberty
i could not hope for gentler conditions
my lord gonzaga since my coming to sienna i've heard much of your prisoner brave bertoldo
such an one madam i had
and have still sir i hope
your hopes deceive you
he is ransom'd madam
by whom i pray you sir
you had best inquire of your intelligencer i am no informer
i like not this
he is as 'tis reported a goodly gentleman and of noble parts a brother of your order
he was madam till he against his oath wrong'd you a princess which his religion bound him from
great minds for trial of their valours oft maintain quarrels that are unjust yet without malice and such a fair construction i make of him i would see that brave enemy
my duty commands me to seek for him
pray you do and bring him to our presence
i must blast his entertainment
may it please your excellency
he is a man debauch'd and for his riots cast off by the king my master and that i hope is a crime sufficient
to you his subjects that like as your king likes
but not to us we must weigh with our own scale
re enter with richly habited and this is he sure
how soon mine eye had found him
what a port he bears
how well his bravery becomes him
nay a princely suitor rather
but i'm too sudden
madam 'twas his suit unsent for to present his service to you ere his departure
with what majesty he bears himself
the devil i think supplies him
ransom'd and thus rich too
you ill deserve kneeling kisses her hand
the favour of our hand we are not well give us more air
what sudden qualm is this
that lifted yours against me
thus once more i sue for pardon
sure his lips are poison'd and through these veins force passage to my heart which is already seized on
i wait madam to know what your commands are my designs exact me in another place
before you have our licence to depart
if manners civility of manners cannot teach you to attend our leisure i must tell you sir that you are still our prisoner nor had you commission to free him
you were my substitute and wanted power without my warrant to dispose of him i will pay back his ransom ten times over rather than quit my interest
this is against the law of arms
but not of love
why hath your entertainment sir been such in your restraint that with the wings of fear you would fly from it
i know no man madam enamour'd of his fetters or delighting in cold or hunger or that would in reason prefer straw in a dungeon before a down bed in a palace
come nearer was his usage such
yes and it had been worse had i foreseen this
o such as thou that have no share in nature's bounties know no pity to such as have them
look on him with my eyes and answer then whether this were a man whose cheeks of lovely fulness should be made a prey to meagre famine
or these eyes whose every glance store cupid's emptied quiver to be dimm'd with tedious watching
or these lips these ruddy lips of whose fresh colour cherries and roses were but copies should grow pale for want of nectar
or these limbs that bear a burthen of more worth than is supported by atlas' wearied shoulders should be cramp'd with the weight of iron
o i could dwell ever on this description
is this in derision or pity of me
in your charity believe me innocent
now you are my prisoner you shall have fairer quarter you will shame the place where you have been should you now leave it before you are recover'd
i'll conduct you to more convenient lodgings and it shall be my care to cherish you
repine who dare it is our will
to the centre such a sybilla guiding me
we stand as we had seen medusa's head
i know not what to think i am so amazed
we are enchanted and this is some illusion
in dark despair it shows a beam of hope contain thy joy adorni
such a princess and of so long experienced reservedness break forth and on the sudden into flashes of more than doubted love
they come again smiling as i live
some fury hath possess'd her
if i speak i may be blasted
re enter and aurel
let not sir the violence of my passion nourish in you an ill opinion or grant my carriage out of the road and garb of private women 'tis still done with decorum
gracious madam vouchsafe a little pause for i am so rapt beyond myself that till i have collected my scatter'd faculties i cannot tender my resolution
consider of it i will not be long from you
pray you fair lady if you can in courtesy direct me to the chaste aurelia
another kind of thing
her love was govern'd by her discretion and not ruled her reason the reverence and majesty of juno shined in her looks and coming to the camp appear'd a second pallas
i can see no such divinities in you if i without offence may speak my thoughts you are as 'twere another helen
ere long you shall know me better
why if you are aurelia how shall i dispose of the soldier
may it please you to hasten my despatch
prefer your suits unto bertoldo we will give him hearing and you'll find him your best advocate
what are we come to
grown up in a moment a favourite
he does take state already
no no it cannot be yet but camiola there is no step between me and a crown
a sin in which all sins are comprehended
aid me virtue or i am lost
may it please your excellence second me sir
then my so horrid oaths and hell deep imprecations made against it
the king your brother will thank you for the advancement of his affairs
and yet who can hold out against such batteries as her power and greatness raise up against my weak defences
sir re enter do you dream waking
'slight she's here again
walks she on woollen feet
you dwell too long in your deliberation and come with a cripple's pace to that which you should fly to
it is confess'd yet why should i to win from you that hazard all to my poor nothing by false play send you off a loser from me
i am already too too much engaged to the king my brother's anger and who knows but that his doubts and politic fears should you make me his equal may draw war upon your territories
were that breach made up i should with joy embrace what now i fear to touch but with due reverence
that hinderance is easily removed
i owe the king for a royal visit which i straight will pay him and having first reconciled you to his favour a dispensation shall meet with us
i am wholly yours
on this book seal it
what hand and lip too
then the bargain's sure
you have no employment for me
yes gonzaga provide a royal ship
john whither are we bound now
you shall know hereafter
my lord your pardon for my too much trenching upon your patience
indisposed but i attend you
exeunt all but ador
the heavy curse that waits on perjury and foul ingratitude pursue thee ever
yet why from me this
in his breach of faith my loyalty finds reward what poisons him proves mithridate to me
i have perform'd all she commanded punctually and now in the clear mirror of my truth she may behold his falsehood
o that i had wings to hear me to palermo
this once known must change her love into a just disdain and work her to compassion of my pain
a room in camiola's house
enter and at several doors
poor i that whilome was the top and ridge of my house am on the sudden turn'd to the pitifullest animal the lineage of the syllis
the king break girdle break
why what of him
hearing how far you doted on my person is come himself a suitor with the awl of his authority to bore my nose and take you from me oh oh oh
do not roar so the king
yet loving sylli is not so sorry for his own as your misfortune if the king should carry you he can but make you a queen and what a simple thing is that to the being my lawful spouse
the world can never afford you such a husband
but how are you sure the king is so inclined
did not you dream this
with these eyes i saw him dismiss his train and lighting from his coach whispering fulgentio in the ear
if so i guess the business
yonder they are i dare not enter and be seen i am so desperate if you forsake me send me word that i may provide a willow garland to wear when i drown myself
it will be worth your pains sir to observe the constancy and bravery of her spirit
though great men tremble at your frowns i dare hazard my head your majesty set off with terror cannot fright her
may she answer my expectation
my knees thus bent to the earth while my vows are sent upward for the safety of my sovereign pay the duty due for so great an honour in this favour done to your humblest handmaid
you mistake me i come not lady that you may report the king to do you honour made your house he being there his court but to correct your stubborn disobedience
a pardon for that could you obtain it were well purchased with this humility
till i am conscious of an offence i will not wrong my innocence to beg one
what is my crime sir
look on him i favour by you scorn'd and neglected
is that all sir
no minion though that were too much
how can you answer the setting on your desperate bravo to murder him
with your leave i must not kneel sir while i reply to this but thus rise up in my defence and tell you as a man since when you are unjust the deity which you may challenge as a king parts from you 'twas never read in holy writ or moral that subjects on their loyalty were obliged to love their sovereign's vices your grace sir to such an undeserver is no virtue
what think you now sir
say you should love wine you being the king and 'cause i am your subject must i be ever drunk
tyrants not kings by violence from humble vassals force the liberty of their souls
i could not love him and to compel affection as i take it is not found in your prerogative
how i admire her confidence
he complains of wrong done him but be no more a king unless you do me right
burn your decrees and of your laws and statutes make a fire to thaw the frozen numbness of delinquents if he escape unpunish'd
do your edicts call it death in any man that breaks into another's house to rob him though of trifles and shall fulgentio your fulgentio live who hath committed more than sacrilege in the pollution of my clear fame by his malicious slanders
have you done this
answer truly on your life
in the heat of blood some such thing i reported
out of my sight
for i vow if by true penitence thou win not this injured lady to sue out thy pardon thy grave is digg'd already
by my own folly i have made a fair hand of 't
you shall know lady while i wear a crown justice shall use her sword to cut offenders off though nearest to us
ay now you show whose deputy you are if now i bathe your feet with tears it cannot be censured superstition
you must rise rise in our favour and protection ever
happy are subjects when the prince is still guided by justice not his passionate will
a room in camiola's house
you see how tender i am of the quiet and peace of your affection and what great ones i put off in your favour
you do wisely exceeding wisely and when i have said i thank you for 't be happy
and good reason in having such a blessing
when you have it but the bait is not yet ready
what news with thee now
off with that gown 'tis mine mine by your promise signior adorni is return'd
off with it off with it madam
be not so hasty when i go to bed 'tis thine
you have my grant too but do you hear lady though i give way to this you must hereafter ask my leave before you part with things of moment
very good when i'm yours i'll be govern'd
you are well return'd
i wish that the success of my service had deserved it
yes and return'd with safety
'tis not then in the power of fate to add to or take from my perfect happiness and yet he should have made me his first visit
so i think too but he syl
durst not appear i being present that's his excuse i warrant you
speak where is he
who hath deserved more from him
or can be of equal merit
i in this do not except the king
he's at the palace with the duchess of sienna
one coach brought them hither without a third he's very gracious with her you may conceive the rest
my jealous fears make me to apprehend
pray you dismiss signior wisdom and i'll make relation to you of the particulars
servant i would have you to haste unto the court
i will outrun a footman for your pleasure
there observe the duchess' train and entertainment
fear not i will discover all that is of weight to the liveries of her pages and her footmen
this is fit employment for me
gracious with the duchess
sure you said so
i will use all possible brevity to inform you madam of what was trusted to me and discharged with faith and loyal duty
i believe it you ransomed him and supplied his wants imagine that is already spoken and what vows of service he made to me is apparent his joy of me and wonder too perspicuous does not your story end so
would the end had answered the beginning
in a word ingratitude and perjury at the height cannot express him
truth is arm'd and can defend itself
it must out madam i saw the presence full the amorous duchess kiss and embrace him on his part accepted with equal ardour and their willing hands no sooner join'd but a remove was publish'd and put in execution
the proofs are too pregnant
he's not worth your sorrow madam
tell me when you saw this did not you grieve as i do now to hear it
his precipice from goodness raising mine and serving as a foil to set my faith off i had little reason
in this you confess the malice of your disposition
as you were a man you stood bound to lament it and not in flattery of your false hopes to glory in it
when good men pursue the path mark'd out by virtue the blest saints with joy look on it and seraphic angels clap their celestial wings in heavenly plaudits to see a scene of grace so well presented the fiends and men made up of envy mourning
whereas now on the contrary as far as their divinity can partake of passion with me they weep beholding a fair temple built in bertoldo's loyalty turn'd to ashes by the flames of his inconstancy the damn'd rejoicing in the object
'tis not well in you adorni
what a temper dwells in this rare virgin
can you pity him that hath shown none to you
i must not be cruel by his example
you perhaps expect now i should seek recovery of what i have lost by tears and with bent knees beg his compassion
no my towering virtue from the assurance of my merit scorns to stoop so low
i'll take a nobler course and confident in the justice of my cause the king his brother and new mistress judges ravish him from her arms
you have the contract in which he swore to marry me
he shall be then against his will my husband and when i have him i'll so use him
doubt not but that your honesty being unquestion'd this writing with your testimony clears all
and buries me in the dark mists of error
i'll presently to court pray you give order for my caroch
exit my good angel help me in these my extremities
if you e'er will see brave sight lose it not now
bertoldo and the duchess are presently to be married there's such pomp and preparation
if i marry 'tis this day or never
why with all my heart though i break this i'll keep the next oath i make and then it is quit
follow me to my cabinet you know my confessor father paulo
yes shall he do the feat for us
i will give in writing directions to him and attire myself like a virgin bride and something i will do that shall deserve men's praise and wonder too
coaches are said to have been first brought into england in by william booner a dutchman who became coachman to queen elizabeth
a state room in the palace
enter a bishop and attendants
had our division been greater madam your clemency the wrong being done to you in pardon of it like the rod of concord must make a perfect union
once more with a brotherly affection we receive you into our favour let it be your study hereafter to deserve this blessing far beyond your merit
as the princess' grace to me is without limit my endeavours with all obsequiousness to serve her pleasures shall know no bounds nor will i being made her husband e'er forget the duty that i owe her as a servant
i expect not but fair equality since i well know if that superiority be due 'tis not to me
when you are made my consort all the prerogatives of my high birth cancell'd i'll practise the obedience of a wife and freely pay it
this done as it is promised may well stand for a precedent to great women
one word more touching the articles
in you alone lie all my hopes you can or kill or save me but pity in you will become you better though i confess injustice 'tis denied me than too much rigour
i will make your peace as far as it lies in me but must first labour to right myself
or add or alter what you think fit in him i have my all heaven make me thankful for him
on to the temple
stay royal sir and as you are a king erect one here in doing justice to an injured maid
o i am blasted
i have given some proof sweet lady of my promptness to do you right you need not therefore doubt me and rest assured that this great work despatch'd you shall have audience and satisfaction to all you can demand
to do me justice exacts your present care and can admit of no delay
if ere my cause be heard in favour of your brother you go on sir your sceptre cannot right me
he's the man the guilty man whom i accuse and you stand bound in duty as you are supreme to be impartial
since you are a judge as a delinquent look on him and not as on a brother justice painted blind infers her ministers are obliged to hear the cause and truth the judge determine of it and not sway'd or by favour or affection by a false gloss or wrested comment alter the true intent and letter of the law
nor will i madam
you seem troubled sir
his colour changes too
the alteration grows from his guilt
the goodness of my cause begets such confidence in me that i bring no hired tongue to plead for me that with gay rhetorical flourishes may palliate that which stripp'd naked will appear deform'd
i stand here mine own advocate and my truth deliver'd in the plainest language will make good itself nor will i if the king give suffrage to it but admit of you my greatest enemy and this stranger prince to sit assistants with him
i ne'er wrong'd you
in your knowledge of the injury i believe it nor will you in your justice when you are acquainted with my interest in this man which i lay claim to
let us take our seats
what is your title to him
by this contract seal'd solemnly before a reverend man presents a paper to the king
i challenge him for my husband
was i sent for the friar for this
this writing is authentical
but done in heat of blood charm'd by her flatteries as no doubt he was to be dispensed with
add this if you please the distance and disparity between their births and fortunes
what can innocence hope for when such as sit her judges are corrupted
disparity of birth or fortune urge you
or at his best in me wants to deserve him
call some few days back and as he was consider him and you must grant him my inferior
imagine you saw him now in fetters with his honour his liberty lost with her black wings despair circling his miseries and this gonzaga trampling on his afflictions the great sum proposed for his redemption the king forbidding payment of it his near kinsmen with his protesting followers and friends falling off from him by the whole world forsaken dead to all hope and buried in the grave of his calamities and then weigh duly what she deserved whose merits now are doubted that as his better angel in her bounties appear'd unto him his great ransom paid his wants and with a prodigal hand supplied whether then being my manumised slave he owed not himself to me
in his silence 'tis acknowledged
if you want a witness to this purpose i'll depose it
if i have dwelt too long on my deservings to this unthankful man pray you pardon me the cause required it
and though now i add a little in my painting to the life his barbarous ingratitude to deter others from imitation let it meet with a fair interpretation
this serpent frozen to numbness was no sooner warm'd in the bosom of my pity and compassion but in return he ruin'd his preserver the prints the irons had made in his flesh still ulcerous but all that i had done my benefits in sand or water written as they had never been no more remember'd
and on what ground but his ambitious hopes to gain this duchess' favour
yes the object look on it better lady may excuse the change of his affection
forgive me modesty if i say you look upon your form in the false glass of flattery and self love and that deceives you
that you were a duchess as i take it was not character'd on your face and that not seen for other feature make all these that are experienced in women judges of them and if they are not parasites they must grant for beauty without art though you storm at it i may take the right hand file
well said i' faith
i see fair women on no terms will yield priority in beauty
why do i rise up in defence of that which in my cherishing of it hath undone me
no madam i recant you are all beauty goodness and virtue and poor i not worthy as a foil to set you off enjoy your conquest but do not tyrannize
yet as i am in my lowness from your height you may look on me and in your suffrage to me make him know that though to all men else i did appear the shame and scorn of women he stands bound to hold me as the masterpiece
by my life you have shown yourself of such an abject temper so poor and low condition'd as i grieve for your nearness to me
i am changed in my opinion of you lady and profess the virtues of your mind an ample fortune for an absolute monarch
since you are resolved to damn yourself in your forsaking of your noble order for a woman do it for this
you may search through the world and meet not with such another phoenix
on the sudden i feel all fires of love quench'd in the water of my compassion
make your peace you have my free consent for here i do disclaim all interest in you and to further your desires fair maid composed of worth and honour the dispensation procured by me freeing bertoldo from his vow makes way to your embraces
oh how have i stray'd and wilfully out of the noble track mark'd me by virtue
till now i was never truly a prisoner
to excuse my late captivity i might allege the malice of fortune you that conquer'd me confessing courage in my defence was no way wanting
but now i have surrender'd up my strengths into the power of vice and on my forehead branded with mine own hand in capital letters and though barr'd from human society and hiss'd into some desert ne'er yet haunted with the curses of men and women sitting as a judge upon my guilty self i must confess it justly falls upon me and one tear shed in compassion of my sufferings more than i can hope for
this compunction for the wrong that you have done me though you should fix here and your true sorrow move no further will in respect i loved once make these eyes two springs of sorrow for you
in your pity my cruelty shows more monstrous yet i am not though most ingrateful grown to such a height of impudence as in my wishes only to ask your pardon
if as now i fall prostrate before your feet you will vouchsafe to act your own revenge treading upon me as a viper eating through the bowels of your benefits to whom with liberty i owe my being 'twill take from the burden that now is insupportable
pray you rise as i wish peace and quiet to my soul i do forgive you heartily yet excuse me though i deny myself a blessing that by the favour of the duchess seconded with your submission is offer'd to me let not the reason i allege for 't grieve you you have been false once
i have done and if when i am married as this day i will be as a perfect sign of your atonement with me you wish me joy i will receive it for full satisfaction of all obligations in which you stand bound to me
i will do it and what's more in despite of sorrow live to see myself undone beyond all hope to be made up again
my blood begins to come to my heart again
pray you signior sylli call in the holy friar he's prepared for finishing the work
i knew i was the man heaven make me thankful
his father was the banker of palermo and this the heir of his great wealth his wisdom was not hereditary
for my part i cannot guess the issue
re enter with father syl
do your duty and with all speed you can you may despatch us
thus as a principal ornament to the church i seize her
so young and so religious
she has forsook the world
i shall run mad
hence with the fool
look on this now truly honour'd in her vow she pays to heaven
this fair hair favours for great kings to wear must now be shorn her rich array changed into a homely gray instead of dainties from the spring for wine cold water we will bring and with fasting mortify the feasts of sensuality
her jewels beads and she must look not in a glass but holy book to teach her the ne'er erring way to immortality
o may she as she purposes to be a child new born to piety pers√©ver in it and good men with saints and angels say amen
this is the marriage
this the port to which my vows must steer me
fill my spreading sails with the pure wind of your devotions for me that i may touch the secure haven where eternal happiness keeps her residence temptations to frailty never entering
i am dead to the world and thus dispose of what i leave behind me and dividing my state into three parts i thus bequeath it the first to the fair nunnery to which i dedicate the last and better part of my frail life a second portion to pious uses and the third to thee adorni for thy true and faithful service
and ere i take my last farewell with hope to find a grant my suit to you is that you would for my sake pardon this young man and to his merits love him and no further
i thus confirm it
gives his hand to cam
and as e'er you hope to like me to be made happy i conjure you to reassume your order and in fighting bravely against the enemies of our faith redeem your mortgaged honour
i restore this gives him the white cross
once more brothers in arms
i'll live and die so
to you my pious wishes
and to end all differences great sir i beseech you to be an arbitrator and compound the quarrel long continuing between the duke and duchess
i will take it into my special care
i am then at rest
now father conduct me where you please
she well deserves her name the maid of honour
may she stand to all posterity a fair example for noble maids to imitate
since to live in wealth and pleasure's common but to part with such poison'd baits is rare there being nothing upon this stage of life to be commended though well begun till it be fully ended
