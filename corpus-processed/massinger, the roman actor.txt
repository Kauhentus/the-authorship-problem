to his deare friend the author
i am no great admirer of the playes poets or actors that are now adayes yet in this worke of thine me thinkes i see sufficient reason for idolatrie
each line thou hast taught is as high as hee could speake when groueling flatterie and his owne pride forgetting heavens rod by his edicts stil'd himselfe great lord and god
by thee againe the lawrell crownes his head and thus reviu'd who can affirme him dead
such power lyes in this loftie straine as can giue swords and legions to and when thy pleades in the defence of actors every grace and excellence of argument for that subject are by thee contracted in a sweete epitome
nor doe thy women the tyr'd hearers vexe with language no way proper to their sexe
iust like a cunning painter thou lets fall copies more faire then the originall
i'll adde but this
from all the moderne playes the stage hath lately borne this winnes the bayes
and if it come to tryall boldly looke to carrie it cleere thy witnesse being thy booke
in philippi massingeri poetae elegantiss actorem romanum typis excusum
ecce philippinae celebrata tragaedia musae quam roscus britonum roscius egit adest
semper fronde ambo vireant parnasside semper liber ab invidrae dentibus esto liber
crebra papyriuori spernas incendia paeti thus vaenum expositi tegmina suta libri nec metuas raucos momorum sybila rhencos tam bardus nebulo si tamen vllus erit

tho to his deseruing friend mr
philip massinger vpon his tragaedie the roman actor
the best of actors in his age acts yet and speakes vpon our roman stage such lines by thee as doe not derogate from romes proud heights and her then learned state
nor great domitians fauour not th'embraces of a faire empresse nor those often graces which from th'applauding theaters were pay'd to his braue action nor his ashes layd in the flaminian way where people strow'd his graue with flowers and martialls wit bestow'd a lasting epitaph not all these same doe adde so much renowne to paris name as this that thou present'st his historie so well to vs
for which in thankes would hee if that his soule as thought pithagoras could into any of our actors passe life to these lines by action gladly giue whose pen so well has made his storie liue
write is growne so common in our time that euery one who can but frame a rime howeuer monstrous giues himselfe that praise which onely hee should claime that may weare bayes by their applause whose judgements apprehend the weight and truth of what they dare commend
in this besotted age friend 'tis thy glory that heere thou hast out done the roman story
domitians pride his wiues lust vnabated in death with paris meerly were related without a soule vntill thy abler pen spoke them and made them speake nay act agen in such a height that heere to know their deeds hee may become an actor that but reades
long'st thou to see proud caesar set in state his morning greatnesse or his euening fate
with admiration heere behold him fall and yet out liue his tragique funerall for 'tis a question whether caesars glorie rose to its heighth before or in this storie
or whether paris in domitians fauour were more exalted then in this thy labour
each line speakes him an emperour eu'ry phrase crownes thy deseruing temples with the bayes so that reciprocally both agree thou liu'st in him and hee surviues in thee
to his long knowne and lou'd friend mr
vpon his roman actor
that my lines being plac'd before thy books could make it sell or alter but a looke of some sowre censurer who's apt to say no one in these times can produce a play worthy his reading since of late 'tis true the old accepted are more then the new
or could i on some spot o'the court worke so to make him speake no more then he doth know not borrowing from his flattering flatter'd friend what to dispraise or wherefore to commend
then gentle friend i should not blush to bee rank'd 'mongst those worthy ones which heere i see vshering this worke but why i write to thee is to professe our loues antiquitie which to this tragaedie must giue my test thou hast made many good but this thy best

what times are these
to what is rome falne
may we being alone speake our thoughts freely of the prince and state and not feare the informer
noble lamia so dangerous the age is and such bad acts are practis'd euery where we hardly sleepe nay cannot dreame with safetie
all our actions are cal'd in question to be nobly borne is now a crime and to deserue too well held capitall treason
sonnes accuse their fathers fathers their sonnes and but to winne a smile from one in grace in court our chastest matrons make shipwracke of their honours
to be vertuous is to bee guilty
they are onely safe that know to sooth the princes appetite and serue his lusts
tis true and tis my wonder that two sonnes of so different a nature should spring from good vespatian
we had a titus stilde justly the delight of all mankinde who did esteeme that day lost in his life in which some one or other tasted not
of his magnificent bounties
one that had a readie teare when he was forc'd to signe the death of an offender
and so farre from pride that he disdain'd not the conuerse euen of the poorest roman
yet his brother domitian that now swayes the power of things is so inclin'd to bloud that noe day passes in which some are not fastend to the hooke or throwne downe from the gemonies
his freemen scorne the nobilitie and he himselfe as if he were not made of flesh and bloud forgets he is a man
in his young yeeres he shew'd what he would be when growne to ripenes his greatest pleasure was being a childe with a sharp pointed bodkin to kill flies whose roomes now men supply
in the vitellian warre he rais'd a temple to iupiter and proudly plac'd his figure in the bosome of the god
and in his edicts he does not blush or start to stile himselfe as if the name of emperour were base great lord and god domitian
i haue letters he's on his way to rome and purposes to enter with all glorie
the flattering senate decrees him divine honours and to crosse it were death with studied torments for my part i will obey the time it is in vaine to striue against the torrent rust
lets to the curia and though vnwillingly grieue our suffrages before we are compeld

to me this reuerence
i pay it ladie as a debt due to her thats caesars mistris
for vnderstand with ioy he that commands all that the sunne giues warmth to is your seruant
be not amaz'd but fit you to your fortunes
thinke vpon state and greatnesse and the honours that waite vpon augusta for that name ere long comes to you still you doubt your vassall but when you haue read this letter writ and sign'd with his imperiall hand you will be freed from feare and jealousie and i beseech you when all the beauties of the earth bowe to you and senators shall take it for an honour as i doe now to kisse these happie feete when euery smile you giue is a preferment and you dispose of prouinces to your creatures thinke on parthenius
i am transported and hardly dare beleeue what is assur'd here
the meanes my good parthenius that wrought caesar our god on earth to cast an eye of fauour vpon his humble handmaide
what but your beautie
when nature fram'd you for her master piece as the pure abstract of all rare in woman she had no other ends but to designe you to the most eminent place
i will not say for it would smell of arrogance to insinuate the seruice i haue done you with what zeale i oft haue made relation of your vertues or how i haue sung your goodnesse or how caesar was fir'd with the relation of your stories i am rewarded in the acte and happie in that my proiect prosper'd
you are modest and were it in my power i would to be thankefull
if that when i was mistris of my selfe and in my way of youth pure and vntainted the emperour had vouchsaf'd to seeke my fauours i had with ioy giuen vp my virgin fort at the first summons to his soft embraces but i am now anothers not mine owne
you know i haue a husband for my honour i would not be his strumpet and how lawe can bee dispenc'd with to become his wife
to mee's a riddle
i can soone resolue it
when power puts in his plea the lawes are silenc'd the world confesses one rome and one caesar and as his rules is infinite his pleasures are vnconfin'd this sillable his will stands for a thousand reasons domit
but with safetie suppose i should consent how can i doe it my husband is a senator of a temper not to be iested with
as if hee durst be caesars riuall
heere he comes with ease i will remoue this scruple
mine owne house made a brothell
sir how durst you though gaurded with your power in court and greatnesse hould conference with my wife
as for your minion i shall hereafter treate
you are rude and sawcie nor know to whom you speake
this is fine i faith
but touch her that respect forgotten that's due to her whom mightiest casar fauours and thinke what 'tis to die
not to loose time
it is sufficient honor you were his taster in this heauenly nectar but now must quit the office
cannot a man be master of his wife because she's young and faire without a pattent
i in mine owne house am an emperour and will defend whats mine where are my knaues
if such an insolence escape vnpunish'd

why am i enter a centurion with souldiers
as you desire my fauour take not so rough a course

yet giue me leaue to put the will of caesar into acte

if you refuse to signe it and so as if you did it vncompell'd wonne to it by reasons that concerne your selfe her honour to vntainted
shall in your best bloud write it newe till torture compell you to performe it
monarchs that dare not doe vnlawfull things yet bare them out are constables not kings parth
i know not what to vrge against my selfe but too much dotage on her loue and obseruance
set it vnder your hand that you are impotent and cannot pay the duties of a husband or that you are mad rather then want iust cause wee'l make you so dispatch you know the danger els deliuer it nay on your knee
madam you now are free and mistris of your selfe
can you domitia consent to this
'twould argue a base minde to liue a seruant when i may commaund

the purpose of this frequent senate is first to giue thankes to the gods of rome that for the propagation of the empire vouchsafe vs one to gouerne it like themselues in height of courage depth of vnderstanding and all those vertues and remarkeable graces which make a prince most eminent our domitian transcend's the ancient romans
i can neuer bring his praise to a period
what good man that is a friend to truth dares make it doubtfull that he hath fabius stay'dnesse and the courage of bould marcellus to whom hanibal gaue the stile of target and the sword of rome
but he has more and euery touch more roman as pompey's dignitie augustus state antonies bountie and great iulius fortune
i am lost in th'ocean of his vertues
in a word all excellencies of good men in him meet but no part of their vices
this is no flatterie
take heed you'l be obseru'd
'tis then most fit that we as to the father of our countrie like thankefull sonnes stand bound to pay true seruice for all those blessings that he showres vpon vs should not conniue and see his gouernment deprau'd and scandaliz'd by meaner men that to his fauour and indulgence owe themselues and being
now he points at vs
cite paris the tragedian
in thee as being the chiefe of thy profession i doe accuse the qualitie of treason as libellers against the state and caesar
meere accusations are not proofes my lord in what are we delinquents
you are they that search into the secrets of the time and vnder fain'd names on the stage present actions not to be toucht at and traduce persons of rancke and qualitie of both sexes and with satiricall
and bitter iests make euen the senators ridiculous to the plebeans
if i free not my selfe and in my selfe the rest of my profession from these false imputations and proue that they make that a libell which the poet writ for a comedie so acted too it is but iustice that we vndergoe the heauiest censure
are you on the stage you talke so boldly
the whole word being one this place is not exempted and i am so confident in the iustice of our cause that i could wish caesar in whose great name all kings are comprehended sate as iudge to heare our plea and then determine of vs
if to expresse a man sould to his lusts wasting the treasure of his time and fortunes in wanton dalliance and to what sad end a wretch thats so giuen ouer does arriue at deterring carelesse youth by his example from such licentious courses laying open the snares of baudes and the consuming arts of prodigall strumpets can deserue reproofe why are not all your golden principles writ downe by graue philosophers to instruct vs to chuse faire vertue for our guide not pleasure condemne vnto the fire
there's spirit in this
or if desire of honour was the base on which the building of the roman empire was rais'd vp to this height if to inflame the noble youth with an ambitious heate t'indure the frosts of danger nay of death to be thought worthy the triumphall wreath by glorious vndertakings may deserue reward or fauour from the common wealth
actors may put in for as large a share as all the sects of the philosophers they which could precepts perhaps seldome reade deliver what an honourable thing the actiue vertue is
but does that fire the bloud or swell the veines with emulation to be both good and great equall to that which is presented on our theaters
let a good actor in a loftie sceane show great alcides honour'd in the sweate of his twelue labours or a bould cancillus forbidding rome to be redeem'd with gold from the insulting gaul's or scipio after his victories imposing tribute on conquer'd carthage
if done to the life as if they saw their dangers and their glories and did partake with them in their rewardes all that haue any sparke of roman in them the slothfull artes layd by contend to bee like those they see presented
he ha's put the consuls to their whisper par
but 'tis vrg'd that we corrupt youth and traduce superiours when doe we bring a vice vpon the stage that does goe off vnpunish'd
doe we teach by the successe of wicked vndertakings others to tread in their forbidden steps
we show no arts of lidian pandarisme corinthian poysons persian flatteries but mulcted so in the conclusion that even those spectators that were so inclin'd go home chang'd men
and for traducing such that are aboue vs publishing to the world their secret crimes we are as innocent as such as are borne dumbe
when we present an heyre that does conspire against the life of his deare parent numbring euery houre he liues as tedious to him if there be among the auditors one whose conscience tells him he is of the same mould we cannot helpe it
or bringing on the stage a loose adultresse that does maintaine the ryatous expence of him that feedes her greedie lust yet suffers the lawfull pledges of a former bed to starue the while for hunger if a matron howeuer great in fortune birth or titles guilty of such a foule vnnaturall sinne crie out tis writ by me we cannot helpe it or when a couetous man's express'd whose wealth arithmatique cannot number and whose lordships a falcon in one day cannot flie ouer yet he so sordid in his mind so griping as not to affoord himselfe the necessaries to maintaine life if a patrician though honourd with a consulship finde himselfe touch'd to the quicke in this we cannot helpe it
or when we show a iudge that is corrupt and will giue vp his sentence as he fauours the person not the cause sauing the guiltie if of his faction and as oft condemning the innocent out of particular spleene if any in this reuerend assemblie nay e'ne your selfe my lord that are the image of absent caesar feele something in your bosome that puts you in remembrance of things past or things intended tis not in vs to helpe it

well put off but yet it must not doe the empire lamia diuided equally can hold no waight if ballanc'd with your guift in faire domitia
you that could part with all delights at once the magazine of rich pleasures being contain'd in her perfections vncompell'd deliuer'd
as a present fit for caesar
in your eyes with teares of ioy not sorrow 'tis confirm'd you glory in your act
sir this is more
more then i can requite it is acknowledg'd lamia
there's no drop of melting nectar i tast from her lippe but yeeldes a touch of immortalitie to the blest receiuer euery grace and feature priz'd to the worth bought at an easie rate if purchas'd for a consulship
so rauishing and her action so attractiue that i would part with all my other senses prouided i might euer see and heare her
the pleasures of her bed i dare not trust the windes or ayre with for that would draw downe in enuie of my happinesse a warre from all the gods vpon mee
your compassion to me is your forbearing to insult on my calamitie which you make your sport would more appease those gods you haue prouok'd then all the blasphemous comparisons you sing vnto her praise
i sing her praise
'tis farre from my ambition to hope it
musicke aboue and a song
it being a debt she onely can lay downe and no tongue else discharge
i thinke prompted with my consent that you once more should heare her she does begin
an vniuersall silence dwell on this place
'tis death with lingring torments to all that dare disturbe her
who can heare this the song ended caesar goe on
and falls not downe and worships
in my fancie apollo being iudge on latinos hill faire hayr'd calliope on her iuorie lute but something short of this sung ceres prayses and grieslie pluto's rape on proserpine
the motion of the spheares are out of time her musicall notes but heard
say lamia say is not her voice angelicall
but i alas am silent
bee so euer that without admiration canst heare her
malice to my felicitie strikes thee dumbe and in thy hope or wish to repossesse what i loue more then empire i pronounce thee guiltie of treason
off with his head
by her that is my patronesse minerua whose statue i adore of all the gods if he but liue to make reply thy life the guard lead off lamia slopping his mouth
my feares of him are freed now and he that liu'd to vpbraid me with my wrong for an offence he neuer could imagine in wantonnes remou'd
plurality of husbands shall no more breede doubts or iealousies in you
'tis dispatch'd and with as little trouble heere as if i had kild a flye
now you appeare and in enter domitia vsherd in by aretinus her traine with all state borne vp by iulia caenis and domitilla
that glorie you deserue and these that stoope to doe you seruice in the acte much honourd
iulia forget that titus was thy father canis and domitilla ne're remmeber sabinus or vespatian
to be slaues to her is more true liberty then to liue parthian or asian queenes
as lesser stars that waite on phaebe in her full of brightnes compar'd to her you are thus i seate you by caesars side
commanding these that once were the adored glories of the time to witnes to the world they are your vassals at your feete to attend you
tis your pleasure and not my pride
and yet when i consider that i am yours all duties they can pay i doe receiue as circumstances due to her you please to honour
enter parthenius with philargus
caesars will commaunds you hither nor must you gaine say it
loose time to see an enterlude
must i pay to for my vexation
not in the court it is the emperours charge
i shall endure my torment then the better
can it bee this sordid thing parthenius is thy father
no actor can expresse him
i had held the fiction for impossible in the scaene had i not seene the substance
sirrha sit still and giue attention if you but nod you sleepe for euer
let them spare the prologue and all the ceremonies proper to our selfe and come to the last act there where the cure by the doctor is made perfect
the swift minutes seeme yeeres to me domitia that diuorce thee from my embraces
my desires encreasing as they are satisfied all pleasures else are tedious as dull sorrowes
kisse me againe if i now wanted heate of youth these fires in priams veines would thaw his frozen bloud enabling him to get a second hector for the defence of troy
let me see the play
enter paris like a doctor of physicke aesopus latinus brought forth a sleepe in a chayre a key in his mouth
o master doctor he is past recouerie a lethargie hath ceas'd him
and howeuer his sleepe resemble death his watchfull care to guard that treasure he dares make no vse of workes strongly in his soule
what's that he holdes so fast betweene his teeth
the key that opens his iron chests cramn'd with accursed gold rustie with long imprisonment
there's no dutie in me his sonne nor confidence in friends that can perswade him to deliuer vp that to the trust of any
philarg he is the wiser we were fashion'd in one mould
he eates with it and when deuotion calles him to the temple of mammon whom of all the gods he kneeles to that held thus still his orisons are payde or will he though the wealth of rome were pawn'd for the restoring of it for one short houre be wonne to part with it
still still my selfe
and if like me he loue his gold no pawne is good securitie
i'll trie if i can force it
it will not be
his auaritious mind like men in riuers drown'd makes him gripe fast to his last gaspe what he in life held dearest
and if that it were possible in nature would carry it with him to the other world
as i would doe to hell rather then leaue it
is he not dead
long since to all good actions or to himselfe or others for which wise men desire to liue
you may with safetie pinch him or vnder his nayles sticke needle s yet he stirs not anxious feare to loose what his soule dotes on renders his flesh insensible
we must vse some meanes to rouse the sleeping faculties of his mind there lies the lethargie
take a trumpet and blowe it into his eares tis to noe purpose the roring noyse of thunder cannot wake him
and yet despaire not i haue one tricke yet left aesop
i will cause a fearefull dreame to steale into his fancie and disturbe it with the horror it brings with it and so free his bodyes organs
'tis a cunning fellow if he were indeed a doctor as the play sayes he should be sworne my seruant gouerne my slumbers and minister to me waking
if this faile a chest brought in
i'll giue him ore
so with all violence rend ope this iron chest
for here is life lyes bound vp in fetters and in the defence of what he values higher 'twill returne and fill each veine and arterie
'tis open and alreadie he begins to stirre marke with what trouble
as you are caesar defend this honest thriftie man they are theeues and come to rob him
peace the emperour frownes
so now powre out the bags vpon the table romoue his iewels and his bonds againe
ring a second golden peale his eyes are open
he stares as he had seene medusas head and were turn'd marble
murther murther they vs murther murther
my sonne in the plot
thou worse then paracide if it bee death to strike thy fathers body can all tortures the furies in hell practise be sufficient for thee that doest assassinate my soule
dost thou envie my glad possession of them for a day
extinguishing the taper of my life consum'd vnto the snuffe
seem not to mind him
haue i to leaue thee rich denied my selfe the ioyes of humaine being
scrap'd and horded a masse of treasure which had solon seene the lidian croesus had appear'd to him poore as the begger irus
and yet i sollicitous to encrease it when my intrayles were clem'd with keeping a perpetuall fast was deafe to their loud windie cries as fearing should i disburse one peny to their vse my heyre might curse me
and to saue expence in outward ornaments i did expose my naked body to the winters cold and summers scorching heate
nay when diseases grew thicke vpon me and a little cost had purchas'd my recouerie i chose rather to haue my ashes clos'd vp in my vrne by hasting on my fate then to diminish the gold my prodigall sonne while i am liuing carelessely scatters
would you would dispatch and die once
your ghost should feele in hell that is my slaue which was your master
out vpon thee varlet
and what then followes al your carke and caring and selfe affliction when your staru'd truncke is turn'd to forgotten dust
this hopefull youth vrines vpon your monument
ne're remembring how much for him you suffer'd
and then tells to the companions of his lusts and ryots the hell you did indure on earth to leaue him large meanes to be an epicure and to feast his senses all at once a happines you neuer granted to your selfe
your gold then got with vexation and preseru'd with trouble maintaines the publicke stewes pandars and ruffians that quaffe damnations to your memorie for liuing so long here
will be so i see it
o that i could redeeme the time that's past i would liue and die like my selfe and make true vse of what my industrie purchas'd
couetous men hauing one foote in the graue lament so euer
but grant that i by art could yet recouer your desperate sicknes lengthen out your life a dozen of yeeres as i restore your body to perfect health will you with care endeuour to rectifie your mind lat
i should so liue then as neither my heyre should haue iust cause to thinke i liu'd too long for being close handed to him or cruell to my selfe
haue your desires phaebus assisting mee i will repayre the ruin'd building of your health and thinke not you haue a sonne that hates you the truth is this meanes with his consent i practis'd on you to this good end it being a deuice in you to shew the cure of avarice
exeunt paris latinus aesopus
an old foole to be guld thus i had he died as i resolue to doe not to be alter'd it had gone off twanging
how approue you sweetest of the matter and the actors
for the subiect i like it not it was filch'd out of horace nay i haue read the poets but the fellow that play'd the doctor did it well by venus he had a tunable tongue and neate deliuery and yet in my opinion he would performe a louers part much better
prethee caesar for i grow wearie let vs see to morrow iplus and anaxerete

there is a busines that i must dispatch and i will straight be with you

dost thou in thy selfe feele true compunction
with a resolution to be a new man
this craz'd bodies caesars but for my minde
trifle not with my anger
canst thou make good vse of what was now presented
and imitate in thy suddaine change of life the miserable rich man that expres'd what thou art to the life
pray you giue me leaue to dye as i haue liu'd
i must not part with my gold it is my life
i am past cure
no by minerua thou shalt neuer more feele the least touch of auarice
take him hence and hang him instantly
if there be gold in hell inioy it thine here and thy life together is forfeited
was i sent for to this purpose
mercie for all my seruice caesar mercie caes
should ioue pleade for him
'tis resolu'd he dyes and he that speakes one sillable to disswade me and therefore tempt me not
it is but iustice
since such as wilfully will hourely dye must tax themselues and not my crueltie
the end of the second act
enter iulia domitilla stephanos
no domitilla if you but compare what i haue suffer'd with your iniuries though great ones i confesse they will appeare like molehils to olimpus
you are tender of your owne wounds which makes you loose the feeling and sense of mine
the incest he committed with you and publikely profes'd in scorne of what the world durst censure may admit some weake defence as being borne headlong to it
but in a manly way to enioy your beauties
besides wonne by his periuries that he would salute you with the title of augusta your faint deniall show'd a full consent and grant to his temptations
but poore i that would not yeeld but was with violence forc'd to serue his lusts and in a kinde tiberius at caprae neuer practis'd haue not heere one conscious touch to rise vp my accuser i in my will being innocent
pardon mee great princesses though i presume to tell you wasting your time in childish lamentations you doe degenerate from the bloud you spring from for there is something more in rome expected from titus daughter and his vncles heyre then womanish complaints after such wrongs which mercie cannot pardon
but you'l say your hands are weake and should you but attempt a iust reuenge on this inhumaine monster
this prodegie of mankind bloudie domitian hath readie words at his command aswell as islands to confine you to remoue
his doubts and feares did he but entertaine the least suspition you contriu'd or plotted against his person
the legions that sacred hierusalem vnder my father titus are sworne his and i no more remembred
and to loose our selues by building on impossible hopes were desperate madnes
you conclude too fast
one single arme whose master does contemne his owne life holds a full command ore his spite of his guards
i was your bondman ladie and you my gracious patronesse my wealthe and libertie your guift and though no souldier to whom or custome or example makes grimme death appeare lesse terrible i dare dye to doe you seruice in a faire reuenge and it will better suite your births and honours to fall at once then to liue euer slaues to his proud empresse that insults vpon your patient sufferings
say but you goe on and i will retch his heart or perish in the noble vndertaking
your free offer confirmes your thankefulnesse which i acknowledge a satisfaction for a greater debt then what you stand ingag'd for but i must not vpon vncertaine grounds hazard so gratefull and good a seruant
the mortall powers protect a prince though sould to impious acts and seeme to slumber till his roaring crimes awake their iustice but then looking downe and with impartiall eyes on his contempt of all religion and morrall goodnesse they in their secrets indgements doe determine to leaue him to his wickednesse which sinckes him when he is most secure
his crueltie increasing dayly of necessitie must render him as odious to his souldiers familiar friends and freemen as it hath done alreadie to the senate then forsaken of his supporters and growne terrible eu'n to himselfe and her he now so dotes on we may put into act what now with safetie we cannot whisper steph
i am still prepar'd to execute when you please to command mee since i am confident he deserues much more that vindicates his countrie from a tyrannie then he that saues a citizen
from the empresse who seemes mou'd in that you waite no better
her prides growne to such a height that shee disdaines the service of her owne women and esteemes her selfe neglected
when the princesses of the bloud on everie course imployment are not readie to stoope to her commands
where is her greatnes
where you would little thinke she could descend to grace the roome or persons
speake where is she
among the players where all state layd by she does enquire who acts this part who that and in what habits
blames the tire women for want of curious dressings and so taken she is with paris the tragedians shape that is to act a louer i thought once she would haue courted him
in the meane time how spends the emperour his houres
as euer he hath done heretofore in being cruell to innocent men whose vertues he calles crimes
and but this morning if't be possible he hath out gone himselfe hauing condemn'd at aretinus his informers suite palphurius sura and good iunius rusticus men of the best repute in rome for their integritie of life no fault obiected but that they did lament his cruell sentence on paetus thraseas the philosopher their patron and instructer
can ioue see this and hold his thunder
nero and caligula commanded onely mischiefes but our caesar delights to see'em
what we cannot helpe we may deplore with silence
we are call'd for by our proud mistresse
we a while must suffer
it is true fortitude to stand firme against all shocks of fate when cowards faint and dye in feare to suffer more calamitie
they are then in fetters
i'll haue thy thoughts
but still submitting to your god like pleasure which cannot be instructed
nor let your sacred maiestie belieue your vassall that with drie eyes look'd vpon his father drag'd to death by your command can pitty these that durst presume to censure what you decreed
'tis my zeale still to preserue your clemencie admi'rd temper'd with iustice that emboldens me to offer my aduice
alas i know sir these bookemen rusticus and pulphurius sura deserue all tortures
yet in my opinion they being popular senators and cried vp with loud applauses of the multitude for foolish honestie and beggerly vertue t'would rellish more of pollicie to haue them made away in priuate with what exquisite torments you please it skils not then to haue them drawne to the degrees in publike for 'tis doubted that the sad obiect may beget compassion in the giddie rout and cause some sudaine uprore that may disturbe you
hence pale spirited coward can we descend so farre beneath our selfe as or to court the peoples loue or feare their worst of hate
can they that are as dust before the whirlewinde of our will and power adde any moment to vs
or thou thinke if there are gods aboue or goddesses but wise minerua that's mine owne and sure that they haue vacant houres to take into their serious protection or care
this many headed monster
mankind liues in few as potent monarchs and their peeres and all those glorious constellations that doe adorne the firmament appointed like groomes with their bright influence to attend the actions of kings and emperours they being the greater wheeles that moue the lesse
bring forth those condemn'd wretches let me see one man so lost as but to pittie 'em and though there lay a million of soules imprison'd in his flesh my hangmens hookes should rend it off and giue 'em libertie
caesar hath said it
enter parthenius aretinus and the guard hangmen dragging in iunius rusticus and palphurius sura bound backe to backe
'tis great caesars pleasure that with fix'd eyes you carefully obserue the peoples lookes
charge vpon any man that with a sigh or murmure does expresse a seeming sorrow for these traytors deaths you know his will performe it
a good bloud hound and fit for my imployments
giue vs leaue to dye fell tyrant
for beyond our bodies thou hast no power
yes i'll afflict your soules
and force them groaning to the stigian lake prepar'd for such to howle in that blaspheame the power of princes that are gods on earth tremble to thinke how terrible the dreame is after this sleepe of death
to guiltie men it may bring terror not to vs that know what 'tis to dye well taught by his example for whom we suffer
in my thought i see the substance of that pure vntainted soule of thraseas our master made a starre that with melodious harmonie invites vs leauing this dunghill rome made hell by thee to trace his heauenly steps and fill a spheare aboue yon chrystall canopie
doe inuoke him with all the aydes his sanctitie of life haue wonne on the rewarders of his vertue they shall not saue your dogs doe you grinne
so take a leafe of seneca now and proue if it can render you insensible of that which but begins here
now an oyle the hangmen torment 'em they still smiling
drawne from the stoicks frozen principles predominant ouer fire were vsefull for you
not a groane is my rage lost

i dare not show a signe of sorrow yet my synnewes shrinke the spectacle is so horrid

if so wee wash an aethiope
liue to deride thee our calme patience treading vpon the necke of tyrannie
that securely as t'were a gentle slumber we indure thy hangmens studied tortures is a debt wee owe to graue philosophie that instruct's vs the flesh is but the clothing of the soule which growing out of fashion though it bee cast of or rent or torne like ours 'tis then being it selfe diuine in her best luster

though it is in thy will to grinde this earth as small as atomes they throwne in the sea to
they shall seeme recollected to thy sense and when the sandie building of thy greatnes shall with its owne weight totter looke to see me as i was yesterday in my perfect shape for i'll appeare in horror

and all was excellent
now heare him speake
that she is faire and that an epethite to foule to expresse her or descended nobly or rich or fortunate and certaine truthes in which poore iphis glories
but that these perfections in no other virgin found abus'd should nourish crueltie and pride in the diuinest anaxarete is to my loue sicke languishing soule a riddle and with more difficultie to be dissolu'd then that the monster sphinx from the steepie rocke offer'd to oedipus
imperious loue as at thy euer flaming altars iphis thy neuer tyred votarie hath presented with scalding teares whose hecatombes of sighes preferring thy power and thy paphian mothers before the thunderers neptunes or pluto's that after saturne did diuide the world and had the sway of things yet were compell'd by thy vneuitable shafts to yeeld and sight vnder thy ensignes be auspicious to this late tryall of my sacrifice of loue and seruice
do's he not act it rarely
obserue with what a feeling he deliuers his orisons to cupid i am rap'd with't

'tis i that am vnworthy but she all merit and may in iustice challenge from the assurance of her excellencies not loue but adoration
yet beare witnesse all knowing powers i bring along with me as faithfull aduocates to make intercession a loyall heart with pure and holy flames with the foule fires of lust neuer polluted
and as i touch her threshold which with teares my limbes benumb'd with cold i oft haue wash'd with my glad lips i kisse this earth growne proud with frequent fauours from her delicate feete

you obseru'd not as it appeares the violence of her passion when personating iphis he pretended for your contempt faire anaxerete to hang himselfe
yes yes i noted that but neuer could imagine it could worke her to such a strange intemperance of affection as to dote on him
by my hopes i thinke not that she respects though all heere saw and mark'd it presuming she can mould the emperours will into what forme she likes though we and all th'informers of the world conspir'd to crosse it
then with what eagernesse this morning vrging the want of health and rest she did intreate caesar to leaue her
who no sooner absent but she calls dwarfe so in her scorne she stiles me put on my pantofles fetch pen and paper i am to write and with distracted lookes in her smocke impatient of so short delay as but to haue a mantle throwne vpon her she seal'd i know not what but 'twas indorsed to my lou'd paris
adde to this i heard her sav when a page receiu'd it let him waite me and carefully in the walke cal'd our retreate where caesar in his feare to giue offence vnsent for neuer enters
this being certaine for these are more then iealous suppositions why doe not you that are so neere in bloud discouer it
alas you know wee dare not
'twill be receaued for a malicious practise to free vs from that slauerie which her pride imposes on vs
but if you would please to breake the ice on paine to be suncke euer we would auerre it
i would second you but that i am commanded with all speede to fetch in ascletario the chaldaean who in his absence is condemn'd of treason for calculating the natiuitie of caesar with all confidence fore telling in euerie circumstance when he shall die a violent death
yet if you could approue of my directions i would haue you speake as much to aretinus as you haue to me deliuer'd
he in his owne nature being a spie on weaker grounds no doubt will vndertake it not for goodnesse sake with which he neuer yet held correspondence but to endea're his vigilant obseruings of what concernes the emperour and a little to triumph in the ruines of this paris enter aretinus
that cros'd him in the senate house
here he comes his nose held vp he hath something in the winde or i much erre alreadie
my designes command me hence great ladies but i leaue my wishes with you
haue i caught your greatnes in the trap my proud augusta
what is't saps him
and my fine roman actor
no courser dish to take your wanton palate saue that which but the emperour none durst cast off
i needs must glory in this rare discouerie but the rewards of my intelligence bid me thinke even now by an edict from caesar i haue power to tread vpon the necke of slauish rome disposing offices and prouinces to my kinsmen friends and clients
this is more then vsuall with him iul
no more respect and reuerence tender'd to mee but aretinus
'tis confess'd that title when you were princesses and commanded all had beene a fauour but being as you are vassals to a proud woman the worst bondage you stand oblig'd with as much adoration to entertaine him that comes arm'd with strength to breake your fetters as tand gallie slaues pay such as doe redeeme them from the oare i come not to intrap you but aloud pronounce that you are manumiz'd and to make your libertie sweeter you shall see her fall this empresse this domitia what you will that triumph'd in your miseries
were you serious to proue your accusation i could lend some helpe
no atome to mee
my eyes and eares are euery where i know all to the line and action in the play that tooke her her quicke dissimulation to excuse her being transported with her morning passion i brib'd the boy that did conuey the letter and hauing perus'd it made it vp againe your griefes and angers are to me familiar that paris is brought to her and how farre he shall be tempted
this is aboue wonder
my gold can worke much stranger miracles then to corrupt poore waiters
heere ioyne with me 'tis a complaint to caesar
this is that shall ruine her and raise you
haue you set your hands to the accusation
and will iustifie what we haue subscrib'd to
i will deliuer it
leaue the rest to me then enter caesar with his guard
let our lieutenants bring vs victory while we enioy the fruites of peace at home and being secur'd from our intestiue foes far worse then forreine enemies doubts and feares though all the skie were hung with blazing meteors which fond astrologers giue out to be assur'd presages of the change of empires and deaths of monarchs wee vndaunted yet guarded with our owne thunder bid defiance to them and fate we being too strongly arm'd for them to wound vs

let not thy passions bee rebellious to thy reason

there's no veine of yours that rises high with rage but is an earthquake to vs

not that we repine to serue her are we her accusers
but that she's falne so low
which on sure proofes vve can make good
and show she is vnworthie of the least sparke of that diuiner fire you haue confer'd vpon her
and vnresolu'd what to determine of you
in this malicious violence you haue offer'd to the altar of her truth and purenesse to me you haue but fruitlesly labour'd to sullye a white robe of perfection black mouth'd enuie could belch no spot on
but i will put off the deitie you labour to take from me and argue out of probabilities with you as if i weare a man
can i beleeue that she that borrowes all her light from me and knowes to vse it would betray her darkness to your intelligence and make that apparent
which by her perturbations in a play vvas yesterday but doubted and find none but you that are her slaues and therefore hate her vvhose aydes she might imploy to make way for her
or aretinus whom long since she knew to be the cabinet counsailor nay the key of caesars secrets
could her beauty raise her to this vnequald height to make her fall the more remarkable
or must my desires to her and wrongs to lamia be reuengd by her and on herselfe that drewe on both
or she leaue our imperiall bed to court a publicke actor
who dares contradict these more then humain reasons that haue power to cloth base guilt in the most glorious shape of innocence
to wel she knew the strength and eloquence of her patron to defend her and thereupon presuming fell securely not fearing an accuser nor the truth produc'd against her which your loue and sauour will ne're discerne from falshood
i'll not heere a syllable more that may inuite a change in my opinion of her
you haue rais'd a fiercer war within me by this fable though with your liues you vowe to make it storie then if and at one instant all my legions reuolted from me and came arm'd against me
heere in this paper are the swords predestin'd for my destruction heere the fatall stars that threaten more then ruine this the deaths head that does assure me if she can proue false that i am mortall which a sudaine feauer would prompt me to beleeue and fayntly yeeld to
but now in my full confidence what she suffers in that from any witnesse but my selfe i nourish a suspition she's vntrue my toughnes returnes to me

we stand attentiue par
o dread caesar to hope for life or pleade in the defence of my ingratitude were againe to wrong you
i know i haue deseru'd death
and my suit is that you would hasten it yet that your highnes when i am dead as sure i will not liue may pardon me i'll onely vrge my frailtie her will and the temptation of that beautie which you could not resist
how would poore i then fly that which followd me and caesar su'd for
and now your sentence

but for this alas you cannot nay you must not sir nor let it to posteritie be recorded that caesar vnreueng'd sufferd a wrong which if a priuate man should sit downe with it cowards would baffell him
with such true feeling thou arguest against thy selfe that it workes more vpon me then if my minerua the grand protectresse of my life and empire on forfeite of her fauour cry'd aloud caesar show mercie
and i know not how i am inclinde to it
i'll promise nothing yet cleare thy cloudie feares and cherish hopes what we must doe we shall doe we remember a tragedie we oft haue seen with pleasure call'd the false seruant
such a one we haue sir
in which a great lord takes to his protection a man forlorne giuing him ample power to order and dispose of his estate in his absence he pretending then a iourney
but yet with this restraint that on no tearmes this lord suspecting his wiues constancie she hauing playd false to a former husband the seruant though sollicited should consent though she commanded him to quench her flames
that was indeed the argument
and what didst thou play in it

if you please to vse this and lay aside your owne sword
in iest nor earnest this parts neuer from me
we'l haue but one short sceane

in the name of wonder what's caesars purpose
there is no contending
and stood grim death now within my view and his vneuitable dart aim'd at my breast his cold embraces should not bring an ague to any of my faculties till his pleasures were seru'd and satisfied which done nestors yeeres to me would be vnwelcome
must we intreate that were borne to command or court a seruant that owes his foode and cloathing to our bountie for that which thou ambitiouslie shouldst kneele for
vrge not in thy excuse the fauours of thy absent lord or that thou standst ingag'd for thy life to his charitie nor thy feares of what may follow it being in my power to mould him any way
as you may me in what his reputation is not wounded nor i his creature in my thankefulnesse suffer
i know you are young and faire be vertuous too and loyall to his bed that hath aduanc'd you to th'height of happinesse
can my louesicke heart be cur'd with counsell
or durst reason euer offer to put in an exploded plea in the court of venus
my desires admit not the least delay
and therefore instantly giue me to vnderstand what i shall trust to
for if i am refus'd and not enioy those rauishing pleasures from thee i run mad for i'll sweare vnto my lord at his returne making what i deliuer good with teares that brutishly thou wouldst haue forc'd from me what i make suit for
and then but imagine what 'tis to dye with these words slaue and traytor with burning corrasiues writ vpon thy forehead and liue prepar'd fort

'tis apparent and then i am nothing

rather then fall vnder your indignation i will yeeld this kisse and this confirmes it
i must take them at it
yes sir be but perfect
i should talke now but i haue forgot my part
but i can doe thus thus and thus
oh i am slaine in earnest
'tis time and 'twas my purpose my good paris and yet before life leaue thee let the honour i haue done thee in thy death bring comfort to thee if it had beene within the power of caesar his dignitie preseru'd he had pardon'd thee
but crueltie of honour did deny it
yet to confirme i lou'd thee
'twas my study to make thy end more glorious to distinguish my paris from all others and in that haue showne my pittie
nor would i let thee fall by a centurions sword or haue thy limbes rent peece meale by the hangmans hooke howeuer thy crime deseru'd it but as thou didst liue romes brauest actor 'twas my plot that thou shouldst dye in action and to crowne it dye with an applause induring to all times by our imperiall hand

wauing their bloudie swordes aboue my head as at their deathes they threatned

howe're it spare the lawrell this proud wreath is no assurance

nor did we transgresse it in our want of will or care for being but men it could not be in vs to make resistance the gods fighting against vs
speake in what did they expresse their anger
wee will heere it but dare not say vndaunted
in briefe thus sir
the sentence giuen by your imperiall tongue for the astrologer ascletario's death with speede was put in execution
for his throate out his legs bound and his armes pinion'd behinde his backe the breathlesse truncke was with all scorne dragg'd to the field of mars and there a pile being rais'd of old dry wood smeer'd o're with oyle and brimstone or what else could helpe to feede or to increase the fire the carkasse was throwne on it but no sooner the stuffe that was most apt began to flame but sudainely to the amazement of the fearelesse souldier a sudaine flash of lightning breaking through the scatter'd cloudes with such a horrid violence forc'd its passage and as disdaining all heate but it selfe in a moment quench'd the artificiall fire
and before we could kindle it againe a clap of thunder follow'd with such noyse as if then ioue incens'd against mankind had in his secret purposes determin'd an vniuersall ruine to the world
this horror past not at deucalions floud such a stormie shower of raine and yet that word is to narrow to expresse it was e're seene imagine rather sir that with lesse furie the waues rush downe the cataracts of nile or that the sea spouted into the ayre by the angry orke endaungering tall ships but sayling neere it so falls downe againe yet heere the wonder ends not but begins for as in vaine we labour'd to consume the witches bodye all the dogs of rome howling and yelling like to famish'd wolues brake in vpon vs and though thousands were kild in th'attempt some did ascend the pile and with their eager fangs ceas'd on the carkasse
but haue they torne it
torne it and deuour'd it
i then am a dead man since all predictions assure me i am lost o my lou'd souldiers your emperour must leaue you yet howeuer i cannot grant my selfe a short reprieue i freely pardon you
the fatall houre steales fast vpon me
i must dye this morning by fiue my souldiers that's the latest houre you e're must see me liuing
ioue auert it in our swords lies your fate and we will guard it
o no it cannot be it is decreed aboue and by no strengths heere to be alterd

but then no trifling
we'l despatch him feare not a dead dog neuer bites
