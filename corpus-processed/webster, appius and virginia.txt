i did my lord and here he is at hand
enter appius his two cozens and clodius
appius my lords your pleasure
appius the senate greet you well and by us do signifie unto you that they have chosen you one of the decemviti
my lords far be it from the thoughts of so poor a plebeian as your unworthy servant appius to soar so high the dignity of so eminent a place would require a person of the best parts and blood in rome
my lords he that must steer at th' head of an empire ought to be the mirrour of the times for wisdome and for policie and therefore i would beseech the senate to elect one
worthy of the place and not to think of one so unfit as appius
my lord y lord▪ you ally with your wits
i have seen children oft eat sweet meats thus as fearfull to devoure them you are wise and play the odest right to make so many of our delight oppius
t yo must ow what e have once concluded cannot for any private mans affection be slighted take your choice then with best judgement of these two proffers either to accept the place prop 'd you or be b nished rome immediately lictors e wa we expe you peedy re olution

noble cozen you wrong your selfe extremely to refuse so eminent a place

or banis t rome
i pray forbear a little
how dost thou like my cunning
i protest i was be agued fearing le t the senate should have accepted at your fain'd refusall
see how your kindred and your friends are must r'd to warme them at your sun shine
were you now in prison or arraign'd before the senate for some suspect of treason all these swallowes would flie your stormy winter not one ing their musick is the summer and the spring
thou observe t shrewdly well e fit them ort
i must be one of the decemvir or banish't rome
banish laugh my trusty marcus i am inforc't to my ambition
i have heard of cunning footmen that have worne shooes made of lead some ten dayes fore a race to give them nimble and more active feet so great men should that eminent place load themselves with excuse and aint deny ll that they with more speed may performe the trial marke his humility saies one how far his dreames are from ambition▪ aies another he would not shew his eloquence lest that should draw him into office and a third is meditating on some thrifty suite to beg 'fore dinner

my lord your answer
to obey my lord and to know how to rule doe differ much to obey by nature comes but to command by long experience
never were great men in so eminent place without their shadowes
envy will attend on greatnesse till this generall frame takes end
'twixt these extreames of state and banishment my minde hath held long conflict and at last i thus returne my answer noble friends we now must part necessity of state compells it so
i must inhabit now a place unknowne you see't compels me leave you
to banishment my lord
i am given up to a long travell full of fear and danger to waste the day in sweat and the cold night in a most desolate contemplation banisht from all my kindred and my friends yea banisht from my selfe for i accept this honourable calling
worthy appius the gods conduct you hither lictors his robes
we are made for ever noble kinsman 'twas but to fright us
but my loving kinsmen mistake me not for what i spake was true bear witnesse all the gods i told you first i was to inhabit in a place unknown 'tis very certaine for this reverend seat receives me as a pupill rather gives ornament to the person then our person the least of grace to it
i shewed you next i am to travell 'tis a certaine truth look by how much the labour of the minde exceeds the bodies so far am i ound with paine and industry beyond the toyle of those that sweat in warre beyond the toyle of any artisan pale cheeks and sunk eyes a head with watching dizied and a haire turn'd white in youth all these at a dear rate
we purchase speedily that tend a state
i told you i must leave you 'tis most true
henceforth the face of a barbarian and yours shall be all one henceforth ile know you but only by your vertue brother or father in dishonest suite shall be to me as is the branded slave
justice should have no kindred friends nor foes nor hate nor love as free from passion as the gods above
i was your friend and kinsman now your judge and whilst i hold the scales a downy feather shall as soone turne them as a masse of pearle or diamonds
excellent excellent lapwing there's other stuffe closed in that subtle brest
he sings and beats his wings far from his nest
so gentlemen i take it here takes end your businesse my acquaintance fare you well

enter numitorius icilius virginia
welcome teach your selfe a older freedome here for by our love your suite to my faire neece doth parallell her kindreds wishes
there's not in all rome a man that is by honour more approv'd nor worthier were you poore to be belov'd
you give me noble lord that character which i cood never yet read in my selfe but from your censure shall i take much care to adorne it with the fairest ornaments of unambitious vertue here i hold my honorable patterne one whose minde appeares more like a ceremonious chappell full of sweet musick then a thronging presence
i am confirm'd the court doth make some shew fairer then else they would doe but her port being simple vertue beautifies the court virginia
it is a flattery my lord you breath upon me and it shewes much like the borrowed painting which some ladies use it is not to continue many dayes my wedding garments will outweare this praise
thus ladies still foretell the funerall of their lords kindnesse
but my lord what newes
enter a servant whispers icilius in the eare
virginius my lord your noble brother disguis'd in dust and sweat is new arriv'd within the city troopes of artisans follow his panting horse and with a strange confused noyse partly with joy to see him partly with fear for what his hast portends they shew as if a sudden mutiny orespread the city
cozen take your chamber
what businesse from the camp
sure sir it beares the forme of some great danger for his horse bloody with spurring shewes as if he came from forth a battel never did you see 'mongst quailes or cocks in fight a bloodier heele then that your brother strikes with
in this forme of orespent horseman having as it seemes with the distracting of his newes forgot house friends or change of raiment he is gone to th'senate house
now the gods bring us safety the face of this is cloudy let us haste to'th senate house and there enquire how neare the body moves of this our threatned fear
enter appius melancholly after clodius
my hand's as ready arm'd to work your peace as my tongue bold to inquire your diseontents
good my lord hear me
i am at much variance within my selfe there's discord in my blood my powers are all in combat i have nothing left but sedition in me
trust my bosom to be the closet of your private griefs
beleeve me i am uncranied
may i trust thee
as the firme centre to indure the burden of your light soot as you would trust the poles to bear on them this airy cannopy and not to fear their shrinking
i am strong fixt and unshaking
then thine ever i love
can this my ponderous secresie be in thine ear so light
seemes my disturbance worthy such scorne that thou deridest my griefs
beleeve me clodius i am not a twig that every gust can shake but 'tis a tempest that must be able to use violence on my grown branches
wherefore laugh'st thou then
not that y'are mov'd it makes me smile in scorne that wise men cannot understand themselves nor know their own prov'd greatnesse
clodius laughes not to think you love but that you are so hopelesse not to presume to injoy whom you affect
what's she in rome your greatnesse cannot awe or your rich purse purchase
promises and thr ats are statemens lictors to arrest such pleasures as they would bring within their strict commands why should my lord droop or deject his eye
can you command rome and not countermand a womans weaknesse
let your gr ce your purse and power on me
ask both and lavish them to purchase ie the rich fee simple of virginia's heart
i have already found an easie path which you may safely tread yet no man trace you
thou art my comforter
her father's busied in our forreign wars and there hath chief imployment all their pay must your discretion scantle keep it back restraine it in the common treasury
thus may a states man'gainst a souldier stand to keep his purse weak whil'st you arme his hand
her father thus kept low gifts and rewards will tempt the maide the sooner nay haply draw the father in to plead in your behalfe
but should these aile then siege her virgin tower with too prevailing engines feare and power
go then and prove a speeding advocate arme thee with all our bounty oratory variety of promise
appius the decemvirate intreat your voice in this dayes senate
old virginius craves audience from the camp with earnest suite for quick dispatch
we will attend the senate
enter spurius opius valerius numitor &c
we sent to you to assist us in this counsell touching the expeditions of our war
ours is a willing presence to the trouble of all state cares
admit him from the camp
speak the camps will
the camp wants money we have store of knocks and wounds gods pl nty but we have no pay this three moneths did we never house our heads but in yon great star chamber never bedded but in the cold field beds our vittaile failes us yet meet with no supply we're fairly promis'd but souldiers cannot feed on promises all our provant apparell's torne to rags and our munition fails us will you send us to fight for rome like beggars
noble gentlemen are you the high state of decemviri that have those things in mannage
pity us for we have need on't
let not your delays be cold to us whose bloods have oft been heated to gaine you fame and riches
prove not to us being our friends worse foes then we fight with let's not be starv'd in kindnesse
sleep you now upon the bench when your deaf ears should listen unto the wretchlesse clamours of the poor
then would i had my drums here they might rattle and rowse you to attendance
most grave fathers shew your selves worthy stewards to our mother fair rome to whom we are no bastard sons though we be souldiers
she hath in her store food to maintain life in the camp as wel as surfet for the city
do not save the foe a labour send us some supply lest ere they kill us we by famine die
shall i my lords give answer to this souldier
be you the cities voyce
virginius we would have you thus possess'd we sit not here to be prescib'd and taught nor to have any suter give us limit whose power admits no curb
next know virginius the camp's our servant and must be dispos'd controul'd and us'd by us that have the strength to knit it or dissolve it
when we please out of our princely grace and clemency to look upon your wants it may be then we shall redress them but till then it fits not that any petty fellow wag'd by us should have a tongue found here before a bench of such grave auditours
pray give me leave not here
pray appius is not this the judgment seat
where should a poor mans cause be heard but here
to you the statists of long flourishing rome to you i call if you have charity if you be humane and not quite giv'n ore to furs and metall if you be romans if you have any souldiers bloud at all flow in your veins help with your able arms to prop a sinking camp an infinite of fair rome's sons cold weak hungry and clothles would feed upon your surfet
will you save them or shall they perish
what we will we will be that your answer perhaps at further leasure we'l help you not your merit but our pleasure
i will not curse thee appius but i wish thou wert i'th' camp amongst the mutineers to tell my answers not to trouble me
make you us dogs yet not allow us bones
oh what are souldiers come too
the strength of all your peace and the iron wall that rings this pomp in from invasive steel shall that decay
then let the forrain fires climb o're these buildings let the sword and slaughter chase the gown'd senate through the streets of rome
to double dye their robes in scarlet let the enemies stript arm have his crimson'd brawns up to the elbowes in your traiterous bloud let ianus temple be devolv'd your treasures ript up to pay the common adversaryes with our due wages
do you look for lesse
the rottenness of this misgovern'd state must grow to some disease incurable save with a sack or slaughter
know you our extremities
and will not help them
when so many gallant spirits that yet may stand betwixt you and destruction are sunk in death
when disorder hath swallowed all our forces
we'l hear no more
peace fellow peace know the decemviri and their authority we shall commit you else
do so and i shall thank you be relieved and have a strong house o're me fear no alarmes given in the night by any quick perdue
your guilty in the city feeds more dainty then doth your generall
'tis a better office to be an under keeper then a captain the gods of rome amend it
break up the senate
and shall i have no answer
what slave would be a soldier to be censured by such as ne'er saw danger
to have out pay our worths and merits allano'd in the scale of base moth eaten peace
i have had wounds would have made all this bench faint and look pale but to behold them searcht
they lay their heads on their soft pillow pore upon then bags grow fat with laziness and resty
and us that stand betwixt them and disaster they will not spare a drachma
o my souldiers before you want i'l sell my smal possessions even to my skin to help you plate and jewels all shall be yours
men that are men indeed the earth shal find the sun and air must feed

virginia you are sirrah corbulo yes i am sirrah but not the party that is born to do that though i have no lorships yet i have so much manners to give my betters place
virginia whom mean you by your betters
corbulo i hope i have learnt to know the three degrees of compa∣rison for though i be bonus and you melior as well as mulier yet my lord icilius is optimus
virginia i see there's nothing in such private done but you must inquire after
corbulo and can you blame us madam to long for the merry day as you do for the merry night
will you be gone sir
oh yes to my lady
i remember my er vir
my father's wondrous and withall exit corbulo
with a supprest rage left his house displeas'd and so in post is hurried to the camp it sads me much to expell which melancholy i have sent for company
enter clodius and musicians
this opportunity was illy waited it is the best part of a politician when he would compasse ought to fame his industry wisely to waite the advantage of the houres his happie minutes are not alwayes present
expresse your greatest art virginia hears you song
oh i conceive the occasion of this harmony
icilius sent it i must thank his kindnesse
let not virginia wate her contemplation so high to call this visit an intrusion for when she understands i tooke my message from one that did compose it with affection i know she will not only extend pardon but grace it with her favour
you mediate excuse for courtesies as if i were so of civi y not to esteeme it worthy of my thanks assure your selfe i could be longer patient to hear my eares so feasted
ioyne all your voyces till you make the aire proud to usurpe your no s and to please her with a sweet eccho serve virginias pleasure
as you have been so full of gentlenesse to heare with patience what was brought to serve you so hearken with your usuall clemency o the relation of a lovers sufferings your figure still does revell in his dreames he banquets on your memory yet findes not thoughts enough to satisfie his wishes as if virginia had compos'd his heart and fills it with her beauty
i see he is a miser in his wishes and thinks he never has enough of that which onely he possesses but to give his wishes satisfaction let him know his heart and mine do so near together that hourely they converse and guard each other
is faire virginia confident she knowes her favour dwels with the same man i plead for
worthy faire one i would not wrong your worth so to employ my language for a man so much beneath the merit of your beauty he i plead for has power to make your beauty populous your frowne shall awe the world and in your smile great rome shall build her happinesse honour and wealth shall not be stil'd companions but servants to your pleasure
then shall icilius but a refin'd citizen boast your affection when lord appius loves you
blesse his great lordship i was much mistaken let thy lord know thou advocate of lust all the intentions of that youth are honourable whil'st his are fill'd with sensuality
and for a finall resolution know our hearts in love like twins alike shall grow
had i a wife or daughter that could please him i would devote her to him but i must shadow this scorne and sooth him still in lust
what newes yet of virginius returne
o the misery of souldiers
they doubly starve us with faire promises
we spread the earth like haile or new reapt corne in this fierce famine and yet patiently make our obedience the confined ile that starves us
souldiers let us draw our swords while we have strength to use them
'tis a motion which nature and necessity commands
y'are of virginius regiment
why doe you swarme in troopes thus
is our command growne idle
come i'le divide you this your conference is not without suspect of mutiny
souldiers shall i relate the grievances
of the whole regiment
then thus my lord
come i will not hear thee
sir you shall sound all the drums and trumpets in the camp to drowne my utterance yet above them all i'le rear our just complaint
stir not my lord i vow you are not safe if you but move a sinew till you heare us
well sir command us you are the generall
no my lord not i i am almost starved i wake in the wet trench loaded with more cold iron then a jaile would give a murderer while the generall sleeps in a field bed and to mock our hunger feeds us with scent of the most curious fare that makes his tables crack our pay detained by those that are our leaders and at once we in this sad and unprepared plight with the enemy and famine daily sight
doe you threaten us
sir you shall hear him out
you send us whips and iron manackles and shackles plenty but the devill a coine
would you would teach us that caniball trick my lord which some rich men 'ith' city oft doe use shall's one devoure another
will you hear me
o rome th'art growne a most unnaturall mother to those have held thee by the golden locks from sinking into ruine romulus was fed by a she wolfe but now our wolves instead of feeding us devoure our flesh carouse our blood yet are not drunk with it for three parts of 't is water
your captaine noble virginius is sent rome for ease of all your grievances
hee's stolne away from's never to returne and now his age will suffer him no more deale on the enemy belike hee'l rne an usurer and in the city aire cut poore mens throats at home sitting in's chaire
you wrong one of the honorablest commanders
i my lord there goes the thrist in victories the generall and commanders share all the honour as they share the spoile but in our overthrowes where lies the blame
the common souldiers fault ours is the shame
what is the reason that being so far distant from the affrighted enemy
wee lie 'ith' open field subject to the sick humors of heaven and earth unlesse you cood bestow two summers of us
shall i tell you truth you account the expence of ingines and of swords of horses and of armor dearer far then souldiers lives
now by the gods you doe
observe you not the ravens and the crowes have left the city surfet and with us they make full banquets
come you birds of death and fill your greedy croppes with humane flesh then to the city flie disgorge it there before the senate and from thence arise a plague to choake all rome
and all the suburbs▪ minut
upon a souldiers word bold gentlemen i expect every houre virginius to bring fresh comfort
now by the gods if ever he returne wee'le drag him to the slaughter by his locks turned white with riot and incontinence and leave a president to all the world how captaines use their souldiers
see hee's returned▪ virginius you are not safe retire your troopes are mutinous we are begirt with enemies more daring and more fierce then is the common foe
my troopes my lord
your life is threatned by these desperate men betake you to your horse
my noble lord i never yet p oiest to teach the art of ying
out troopes grown mutinous
he dares not look on me with half a that spread this wildfire
where is our lieutenant
sirrah order our companies
what do you mean my lord
take air a little they have heated me
sirrah i'st you will mutiny
is your gall burst you traitor
the gods defend sir
or is your stomack sea sick doth it rise
i'l make a passage for it
noble captain i'l dye beneath your foot
you rough porcupine ha
do you bristle do you shoot your quils you rogue
they have no points to hurt you noble captain
wast you my nimble shaver that would whet your sword 'gainst your commanders throat you sirrah
my lord i never dream't on't
slaves and cowards what are you cholerick now
by the gods the way to purge it were to let you blood
i am i'th' center of you and i'l make the proudest of you teach the aspen leaf to tremble when i breath
see noble lord these are no mutineers these are obedient souldiers civil men you shal command these if your lordship please to fil a ditch up with their slaughtered bodies that with more ease you may assault some town
so now lay down your arms
villains and traitors i here cashier you
hence from me my poison not worthy of our discipline go beg go beg you mutinous rogues brag of the service you ne'er durst look on it were charity to hang you for my mind gives y'are reserv'd to rob poor market women
i do beseech you to confirm my sentence as you respect me
i will stand my self for the whole regiment and safer far in mine owne single valour then begirt with cowards and with traitors
o my lord you are too severe
now by the gods my lord you know no discipline to pitie them
no sooner my back turn'd but presently to mutinie
refuse me if such traiterous rogues would not confound an army
when doe you march
when doe you march gentlemen
my lord wee'l starve first wee'le hang first by the gods doe any thing ere wee'le forsake you
good virginius limit your passion
sir you may take my place not my just anger from me these are they have bred a dearth i'th' campe i'le wish our foes no greater plague then to have their company show but among them all so many scars as stick upon this flesh i'le pardon them
how now my lord breathlesse
mischiefs confound me if i could not wish my youth renewed againe with all her sollies onely to'ave breath enough to raile against these'tis too short
see gentlemen what strange distraction your falling off from duty hath begot in this most noble souldier you may live the meanest of you to command a troope and then in others youle correct those faults which in your selves you cherisht every captain beares in his private government that forme which kings should ore their subjects and to them should be the like obedient
we confesse you have been distrest but can you justly challenge any commander that hath surfeted while that your food was limited
my lord i have shared with them an equall for▪ hunger and cold marcht thorough watery fens tune borne as great burdens as the pioneer when scarce the ground would bear me
good my lord give us leave to proceed the punishment your captaine hath inflicted is not sufficient for it cannot bring any example to succeeding of pennance worth your faulting happily it may in you beget a certaine shame but it will in others a strong hope of the like lenity
yet gentlemen you have in one thing given me such a taste of your obedience when the fire was raised of fierce sedition and the cheeke was swolne to sound the fatall trumpet then the sight of this your worthy captaine did disperse all those unfruitfull humours and even then convert you from feirce tigers to stayed men we therefore pardon you and doe restore your captaine to you you unto your captaine
the gods requite you noble generall
my lord my lord omnes
your pardon noble captaine
well you are the generall and the fault is quit a souldiers teares an elder brothers wit have little falt in them nor doe they season things worth observing for their want of reason
take up your armes and use them doe i pray ere long youle take your to run away
and what supply from rome
good store of corne
most honourable especially by the lord appius
there is great hope that appius will grow the souldiers patron with what vehemency he urg'd our wants and with what expedition he hasted the supplies it is almost i redible
there's promis'd to the souldier besides their corne a bounteous donative a shout
but 'tis not certaine yet when't shall be paid
how for your owne particular
my lord i was not enter d fully two pikes length into the senate but they all stood bare and each man offer'd me his seat the businesse for which i went dispatcht what guifts what favours were done me your good lordship shall not hear for you would wonder at them onely this 'twould make a man fight up to'th' neck in blood to think how nobly he shall be received when he returnes to'th' city
'tis well give order the provision be divided and sent to every quarter
thus men must flight their wrongs or else conceal them when generall safety wills us not reveale them
enter two petitioners at one doore at the other clodius
pray is your lord at leasure
what is your suite
to accept this poore petition which makes knowne my many wrongs in which i crave his justice and upright sentence to support my cause which else is trod downe by oppression
my lords hand is the prop of innocence and if your cause be worthy his supportance it cannot fall
the gods of rome protect him
what is your paper too petitionary
it leanes upon the justice of the judge your noble lord the very stay of rome
and surer basis for a poore mans cause she cannot yeeld
your papers i'le deliver and when my lord ascends the judgement seate you shall find gracious comfort
faire virginia's late betroth'd
your eares i hope you have not forfeited that you returne no answer
i desire admittance to him
please you attend i'le know his lordships pleasure
i pray heaven she have not blab'd
a petty lawyer t'other day glad of a fee but cal'd to eminent place even to his betters now the word's attend
this gowned office what a breadth it bears
how many tempests waite upon his frowne
all the petitioners withdraw
appius must have this place more private▪ as a favour reserv'd for you icilius
enter appius with lictors afors him
be gone this place is only spar'd for us and you icilius
may i speak it freely
we have suffering ears a heart the sof est downe may penetrate
we are private pray your courtefie
leave that to th' publick eye of rome and of romes people
place me a second chaire that done remove your self
so now your absence clodius
icilius sit this grace we make not common unto the noblest romane but to you our love affords it freely
it is you would be kind unto the camp
wherein icilius doth the camp touch thee
thus old virginius now my father in law kept from the publick pay consumes himself sels his revenues turnes his plate to coyn to wage his souldiers and supply the camp wasting that useful substance which indeed should rise to me as my virginia's dowry
we meet that opposition thus icilius
the camps supplies doth not consist in us but those that keep the common treasury speak or intreat we may but not command
but sir i wonder you so brave a youth son to a thrifty romane should ally you and knit your strong armes to such falling branches which rather in their ruine will bear down your strength then you support their rottenness
be swayed by me fly from that ruinous house
whose fall may crush you and contract with mine whose bases are of marble deeply fixt to uger all gusts and impending stormes
ca off that beggars daughter poor virginia whose dowry and beauty i'l see trebled both in one lly'd to me
my lord my lord think you i can imagine your close and sparing hand can be profuse to give that man a palace whom you late deny'd a cottage
will you from your own coffers grant me a treble dowry yet interpose me a poor third from the common treasury
you must move me by possibilities for i have brains give first your hand and seal that old virginius shall receive his pay both for himself and souldiers and that done i shall perhaps be soon induc'd to think that you who with such willingness did that app
is my love mispriz'd
yes virginia lustful lord
i did but trace your cunning all this while
you would bestow me on some appian trull and for that dross to cheat me of my gold for this the camp pines and the city smarts
all rome fares worse for thy incontinence
this hand hath intercepted thy letters and perus'd thy tempting guests these ears have heard thy amorous passions wretch these eyes beheld thy treacherous name subscrib'd
a judg a divel
come hear no more
sit still or by the powerful gods of rome i'l nail thee to the chair
but suffer me i'l offend nothing but thine ears
tempt not a lovers fury if thou dost now by my vow insculpt in heaven i'l send thee
you see i am patient
hope not of any grace or the least favour i am so covetous of virginia's love i cannot spare thee the least look glance touch
divide one bare imaginary thought into a thousand thousand parts and that i'l not afford thee
nay i will not
hadst thou a judges place above those judges that judg all souls having power to sentence me i would not bribe thee no not with one hair from her fair temples
nay i would not
think not her beauty shall have leave to crown thy lustfull hopes with the least spark of blisse or have thine ears charm'd with the ravishing sound even of her harshest phrase
nay thou shalt not
shee's mine my soul is crownd in her desire to her i'ld travell through a land of fire
now have you done
i have spoke my thoughts
then will thy fury give me leave to speak
i pray say on
icilius i must chide you and withall tell you your rashnesse hath made forfeiture even of your precious life which wee esteeme too deer to call in question
i i wisht you of my allyance graft into my blood condemn you me for that
oh see the rashnesse and blind misprision of youth
as for the maid virginia wee are far even in least thought from her and for those letters tokens and presents wee acknowledg none
alas though great in place wee are not gods
if any false impostor hath usurpt our hand or greatnesse in his own behoof can wee help that
icilius there's our hand your rashnesse we remit let's have hereafter your love and best opinion
for your suit repair to us at both our better leisures wee'l breathe in it new life
i crave your don
granted ere crav'd my good icilius
it is no more indeed
if any of our servants wait without command them in
our secretary we have use for him
icilius send him hither
go to thy death thy life is doom'd and cast
appius be circumspect and be not rash in blood as th'art in lust be murderous stil but when thou strik'st with unseen weapons kill
who hath stirr'd up this tempest in your brow
all you panthean gods confound me if my soul be accessary to your distractions
to send a ruffian higher even to my closet first to brave my greatness play with my beard revile me taunt me hisse me nay after all these deep disparagements threat me with steel and menace me unarm'd to nail me to my seat if i but mov'd all these are slight slight toyes
ruffian icilius he that in the front of a smooth citizen bears the rugged soul of a most base bandetto
he shall die for't
be not too rash
were there no more men to support great rome even falling rome should perish ere he stand i'l after him and kill him
stay i charge thee
lend me a patient ear to right our wrongs we must not menace with a publick hand we stand in the worlds eye and shall be taxt of the least violence where we revenge we should smile smoothest where our hate's most deep and when our spleen's broad waking seem to sleep
let the young man play still upon the bit till we have brought and train'd him to our lure great men should strike but once and then strike sure
love you virginia still
do i still live
then she's your own
virginius is you say still in the camp
now in his absence will i claim virginia to be the daughter of a bond woman and slave to me to prove which i'l produce firme proofs notes probable sound witnesses then having with your lictors summond her i'l bring the cause before your judgement seat where upon my infallid evidence you may pronounce the sentence on my side and she become your strumpet not your bride
thou hast a copius brain but how in this shall we dispose icilius
if he spurne clap him up close there's wayes to charm his spleen
by this no scandal can redound to you the cause is mine you but the sentencer upon that evidence which i shall bring
the business is to 'ave warrants by arrest
to answer such things at the judgment bar as can be laid against her ere her friends can be assembled ere her self can study her answer or scarce know her cause of summons to descant on the matter appius may examine try and doom virginia
but all this must be sudden
thou art born to mount me high above icilius scorn
i'l leave it to thy manage
enter nurse and the clown
what was that you said nurse
why i did say thou must bestir thy selfe
i warrant you i can bestir my stumps as soon as ano∣ther if fit occasion be offered but why do you come upon me in such haste
is it because nurse i should come over you at leisure
come over me thou knave
what dost thou mean by that
only this if you will come off i will come on
my lord hath strangers to night you must make ready the parlour a table and lights nay when i say
me thinks you should rather wish for a bed then for a board for darkness then for lights yet i must confess you have been a light woman in your time but now
what now you knave
but now i'l go fetch the table and some lights presently
enter numitorius horatio valerius icilius numit
some lights to usher in these gentlemen clear all the roomes without there
none interrupt our conference
nurse my mostchild if it please you
fair virginia you are welcome
the rest forbear us till we call
sweet cozen our business and the cause of our discourse admits you to this councel
ieilius we are private now proceed
then thus lord appius doth intend me wrong and under his smooth calmnesse cloaks a tempest that will ere long break out in violence on me and on my fortunes
my good cozen you are young and youth breeds rashness
can i think lord appius will do wrong who is all justice the most austere and upright censurer that ever sate upon the awful bench
icilius you are neer to me in blood and i esteem your safety as mine owne
if you will needs wage eminence and state chuse out a weaker opposite not one that in his arm bears all the strength of rome
besides icilius know you the danger what it is to scandal one of his place and sway
i know it kinsmen yet this popular greatness can be no bug bear to affright mine innocence
no his smooth crest hath cast a palped film over romes eyes
he juggles a plain juggler
lord appius is no lesse
nay then cozen you are too harsh and i must hear no more
it ill becomes my place and gravity to lend a face to such reproachful terms 'gainst one of his high presence
to see me draw his picture 'fore your eyes to make this man seem monstrous and this god rome so adores a divel a plain divel
this lord this judg this appius that professeth to all the world a vestal chastity is an incontinent loose leacher growne
daily and hourely he tempts this blushing virgin with large promises with melting words and presents of high rate to be the stale to his unchaste desires
'tis actual truth i pray but ask your neece
most true i am extremely tyr'd and wearied with messages and tokens of his love no answer no repulse will satisfie the tediousness of his importunate suit
and whilst i could with modesty and honour without the danger of reproach and shame i kept it secret from icilius but when i saw their boldness found no limit and they from fair intreaty grew to threats i told him all
true understanding which to him i went
to that gyant the high colossus that bestrides us all i went to him
how did you bear your self
like appius at the first dissemblingly but when i saw the coast clear all withdrawn and none but we two in the lobby then i drew my poinyard took him by the throat and when he would have clamor'd threatned death unlesse he would with pa ence hear me out
i made him that he durst not squeake not move an eye not draw a breath too loud nor stir a fingar
keep fast the door there sweet couz not too loud
why i told him all gave him his due call'd him lascivious judge a thousand things which i have now forgot shewd him his hand a witnesse 'gainst himself and every thing with such known circumstance that he might well excuse but not deny
why friends in outward shew
but i perceiv'd his heart that hypocrite was born to gull rome and deceive us all
he swore to me quite to abjure her love yet ere my self could reach virginia's chamber one was before me with regreets from him i know his hand
th' intent of this our meeting was to intreat your counsell and advice the good old man her father is from home i think it good that she now in his absence should lodg in secret with some private friend where appius nor his lictors those blood hounds can hunt her out
you are her unkle sir i pray counsell the best
to oppose our selves now in this heat against so great a man might in my judgment to our selves bring danger and to my neece no safety
if we fall she cannot stand lets then preserve our selves until her father be discharg'd the camp
and good icilius for your private ends and the dear safety of your friends and kindred against that statist spare to use your spleen
i will be sway'd by you
my lords 'tis late and time to break up conference
noble uncle i am your growing debtor
i will conduct virginia to her lodging
good night to all at once
the gods of rome protect you all and then we need not fear the envious rage of men
enter clodius with foure lictors
and lictors bestow your selves in some close shops about the forum till you have the sight of faire virginia for i understand this present morning shee'l come forth to buy some necessaries at the sempsters shops how ere accompanied be it your care to sease her at our action
good my friends disperse your selves and keep a carefull watch
'tis strange that ladies will not pay their debts
'it were strange indeed if that our romane knights
would give them good example and pay theirs
the calender that we lictors goe by is all dog dayes
right our common hunt is still to dog unthrifts
and whats your book of common prayer

i know no man more valiant then we are for wee back knights and gentlemen daily
right we have them by the back hourely your french flye ap∣plied to the nape of the neck for the french rheume is not so sore a drawer as a lictor
some say that if a little timbred fellow would just e a great lo∣gerhead let him be sure to lay him i'th' kennell but when we shoulder a knight or a knights fellow we make him more sure for we ken∣nell him i'th' counter
come lets about our businesse

ignoble villaine i am as free as the best king or consull since romulus
what dost thou meane
give notice to my uncle and icilius what violence is offer'd me▪ clod
doe you presse women for diers or do you beg women instead of other commodities to keep your hands in e
by this light if thou hast any eares on thy head as it is a question i'le make my lord pull you out by th' eares though you take a castle
come will you goe along
whither should she goe sir
here's pulling and haling a poore gentlewoman
hold you your prating reverence the whip shall cease on you for your smooth cozenage
are not you servant to lord appius
how ere i am your lord and will approve it 'fore all the senate
thou wilt prove thy selfe the cursed pander for anothers lust and this your plot shall burst about your ears like thunderbo ts
hold you that confidence first i will you by co of l and then i'le alke with you
enter icilius and numitorius
how now faire icilius
what's the offence of faire virginia you bend your weapons on us
sir stand back we fear a rescue
there's no need of feare where there's no cause of rescue what's the matter
your incredulity hath quite undone me i am now no more virginius daughter so this villaine urges but publish't for his bond woman
'tis true my lord and i will take my right by course of law
villaines set her free or by the power of all our romane gods i'le give that just revenge unto my rage which should be given to justice
sir we doe not come to fight wee'le deale enter appius
by course of law
my lord we fear a rescue
never fear't here's none in presence but civill men
my lord i am glad to see you
noble icilius we shall ever love you
now gentlemen reach your petitions
my lord my lord
worthy icilius if you have any businesse defer't untill tomorrow or the afternoone i shall be proud to pleasure you
the fox is earth't my lord you cannot winde him yet
stooles for my noble friends
i pray you sit clodius
may it please your lordship
have i not beg'd for bearance of my best and dearest friends and must you trouble me
my lord i must be heard and will be heard were all the gods in parliament i'de burst their silence with my importunity but they should heare me
the fellow's mad we have no leasure now to heare you sir
hast now no leasure to heare just complaints
resigne thy place o appius that some other may doe me justice then
wee'l hear't to morrow
o my lord deny me justice absolutely rather them feed me with delayes
good my lord hear him and wonder when you heare him that a case so full of vile imposture should desire to be unfoulded
i my lord 'tis true the imposture is on their parts
hold your prating away with him to prison clamorous fellow
suspect you our uprightnesse
no my lord but i have mighty enemies my lord will overflow my cause
see here i hold my bondwoman that brags her selfe to be descended of a noble family
my purse is too scant to wage law with them i am infor 't be mine own advocate not one will pleade for me
now if your lordship will doe me justice so if not then know high hills are safe when seas poore dales or▪ eflow
sirra i think it fit to let you know e're you proceed in this your subtle suite what penalty and danger you acrne if you be found to double
here's a virgin famous by birth by education noble and she forsooth haply but to draw some piece of money from her worthy father must needs be challeng'd for a bondwoman
sirra take heed and well bethink your selfe i'le make you a president to all the world if i but finde you tripping
and view on that condition these just proofes
is that the virgins nurse
he milc nurse my lord i had a sore hand with her for a year and a quarter i have had somewhat to doe with her since too for the poore gentlewoman hath been so troubled with the green sicknesse
i pray thee nurse intreat sertorius to come and speak with me
here is strange circumstance view it my lord if he should prove this it would make virginius think he were wronged
there is a devilish cunning exprest in this black forgerie
icilius and virginia pray come near compound with this base fellow
you were better disburse some trifle then to undergo the question of her freedome
she were not worth a handfull of a bride if she did need a bribe
nay take your course i onely give you my opinion i aske no fee for't
do you know this fellow
yes my lord he's your servant
y'are i'th' right but will you truly know his character
he was at first a pettie notary a fellow that being trusted with large summes of honest citizens to be imploy'd i'th' trade of usury this gentleman couching his credit like a tilting staffe most cunningly it brake and at one course he ran away with thirty thousand pound returning to the city seven year after having compounded with his creditors for the third moity he buyes an office belonging to our place depends on us in which the oppression and vile injuries he hath done poore suters they have cause to rue and i to pity he hath sold his smiles for silver but his promises for gold his delayes have undone men
the plague that in some foulded cloud remaines the bright sun soone disperseth but observe when black infection in some dunghill lies there's worke for bells and graves if it doe rise
he was an ill prop to your house my lord
tis true my lord but we that have such servants are like to cuccolds that have riotous wives we are the last that know it this is it makes noblemen suspected to have done ill when the oppression lies in their proud followers
my lord it was some soothing sicophant some base detracting rascal that hath spread this falsehood in your ears
peace impudence did i not yester day no longer since surprize thee in thy study counterfeiting
'tis true my lord
being subscribed unto a letter fill'd with amorous stuff unto this lady
i have askt your pardon and gave you reason why i was so bold to use that forgery
did you receive it
i did my lord and i can shew your lordship a packet of such letters
now by the gods i'l make you rue it
i beseech you sir show them the reason mov'd you counterfeit our letter
sir i had no other colour
to come to speak with her
did you until this hour acquaint the lady with your intended suit
at several times and would have drawn her by some private course to have compounded for her liberty
now by a virgins honour and true birth 'tis false my lord i never had a dream so terrible as is this monstrous divel
well sir referring my particular wrong to a particular censure i would know what is your suit
my lord a speedy tryal
you shall obtain't with all severity i will not give you longer time to dream upon new slights to cloak your forgery observe you this camelion my lords
ile make him change his colour presently
my lord although th' uprightness of our cause needs no delayes yet for the satisfaction of old virginius let him be present when we shall crave a tryal
sir it needs not who stands for father of the innocent if not the judg
ile save the poor old man that needless travel
with your favour sir we must intreat some respit in a business so needful of his presence
i do protest you wrong your selves thus to importune it
well let it be to morrow i'l not sleep till i have made this thicket a smooth plain and giv'n you your true honor back again
my lord the distance 'twixt the camp and us cannot be measured in so short a time
let us have four dayes respit
you are unwise rumor by that time will have fully spred the scandal which being ended in one hour will turn to air to morrow is the tryal in the mean time let all contented thoughts attend you
my lord you deal unjustly thus to dismiss her this is that they seek for before to morrow they'l convey her hence where my claim shall not seise her
cunning knave you would have bond for her appearance
i think the motions honest
icilius shall engage his honoured word for her appearance
as you please my lord but it were fitting her old uucle there were jointly bound with him
well sir your pleasure shall have satiety
you'l take our word for her appearance will you not sir i pray
most willingly my lord
then sir you have it and i'th' mean time i'l take the honoured lady into my guardianship and by my life i'l use her in all kindness as my wife
now by the gods you shall not
not use her as your wife sir
o my lord i spake it from my heart
she is a virgin sir and must not lye under a mans forth coming do you mark
not under your forth coming leacherous appius
mistake me not my lord our secretary take bonds for the appearance of this lady
and now to you sir you that were my servant i here casheire you never shalt thou shrowde thy villanies under our noble roofe nor scape the whip or the fell hangmans book by warrant of our favour
so my lord i am more free to serve the gods i hope now i have lost your service
harke you sirra who shall give bonds for your appearance ha
to justifie your claim
i have none my lord
away commit him prisoner to his chamber i'le keep you safe from starting
away i wil not hear you
a judges heart here in the midst must stand and move not a haires bredth to either hand
o were thy heart but of the self same piece thy tongue is appius how blest were rome
post to the campe sertorius thou hast heard th'effect of all relate it to virginius
i pray thee use thy ablest horsemanship for it concerns us near
i goe my lord
sure all this is damn'd cunning
o my lord seamen in tempests shun the flattering shore to bear full sails upon't were danger more
so men o're born with greatness stil hold dread false seeming friends that on their bosomes spread for this is a safe truth which never varies he that strikes all his sailes seldome miscarries
must we be slaves both to a tyrants will and confounding ignorance at once
where are we in a mist or is this hell
i have seen as great as the proud judge have fell the bending willow yeilding to each wind shall keep his rooting firme when the proud oak
braving the storme presuming on his root shall have his body rent from head to foote let us expect the worst that may befal and with a noble confidence beare all
enter appius clodius and a servant
here bear this packet to minutius and privately deliver't make as much speed as if thy father were deceas'di'th' camp and that thou went'st to take th'administration of what he left thee
i go my lord
o my trusty clodius
my dear lord let me adore your divine policy
you have poison'd them with sweet meats you have my lord
but what contain those letters
minutius is commanded by that packet to hold virginius prisoner in the camp on some suspect of treason
but my lord how will you answer this
tush any fault or shadow of a crime will be sufficient for his committing thus when he is absent we shall in a more calm and friendly sea sail to our purpose
mercury himself could not direct more safely
o my clodius observe this rule one ill must cure another as aconi um a strong poison brings a present cure against all serpents stings
in high attempts the soul hath infinite eyes and 'tis necessity makes men most wise
should i miscarry in this desperate plot this of my fate in after times be spoken i'l break that with my weight on which i am broken
enter two serving men at one door at the other corbulo the clowne melancholy
why how now corbulo
thou wast not wont to be of this sad temper
what's the matter now
times change and seasons alter some men are born to the bench and some to the halter
what do you think now that i am
i think thee to be virginia's man and corbulo
no no such matter ghess again tell me but what i am or what manner of fellow you imagine me to be
i take thee to be an honest good fellow
wide of the ow hand stil corbulo is no such man
what art thou then
listen and i'l describe my self to you i am something better then a knave and yet come shor of being an honest man and though i can sing a ble yet m accounted b one of the base being indeed and a the ca stands with me at this present in∣feriour to a rogue and three degrees worse then a rascal
how comes this to passe
only by my services successe
take heed whom you serve
oh you serving creatures for this is all i have got by serving my lady virginia
why what of her
she is not the woman you take hee to be for though she have borrowed no money yet she entered into bonds and though you may think her a woman not sufficient yet 'tis very like her bond will be taken
the truth challenged to be a bond woman now if she be a bond woman and a slave and i her servant and vassal what did you take me to be
i am an a a coat a worm a wood∣cock amongst birds a hodmond d amongst flies amongst cu s a trindle tale and amongst fishes a poor ipèr but amongst serving men worse worse then the mans man to the under yeomen few ∣rer
but is it possible thy lady is challenged to be a slave
what witness have they
witness these fountains these flood gates these well∣springs the poor gentlewoman was arrested in the open market i offered i offered to bail her though she was i could not be taken
the grief hath gone so ar my heart that i be made free i shall never be mine own man
the lord appius hath com∣mitted her to ward and it is thought she shall neither lye on the knight side not in the troping ward for if he may have his will of her he means to put in the hole
his warrant hath be out for her but how the case stands with him or how matters will be taken up with her s yet uncertain
when shall the tryal be
i take it to be as soon as the morning is brought a bed of a new son and serving
and vvhen is that▪ corb
to every morning you knovv brings forth a nevv n b they short liv'd for every night shee drovvns them in the western ea
but hese as too high for your d ll app
shall you at the tryal to morrow
by lp e there
and i if i li ▪ corb
and i if i dye for here's my hand i'l meet you
it is thought my old master will be there at the bar for though all the timber of his house yet stand yet my lord numitorius hath sent one of his posts to the camp to bid him spur cut and come to the sen∣tence
oh we have a house at home as heavy as if it were covered with lead
but you will remember to be there
and not to fail
if i chance to meet you there and that the case go against us i will give you a quart not of wine but of tears for instead of a new role i purpose to break my fast with sops of sorrow
enter virginius like a slave numitorius icilius valerius horatio virginia like a slave julla calphurina nurse
thanks to my noble friends itnow appears that you have rather lov'd me then my fortune for that's near shipwrackt chance you see still ranges and this short dance of life is full of changes
how hollow that name founds how dreadful
it is a question whether the proud leacher will view us to our merit for they say his memory to vertue and good men is still carousing leth
o the gods not with more terror do the souls in hell appear before the seat of rhadamant then the poor clyent yonder
why do you wear this habit
it ill fits your noble person or this reverend place
thats true old man but it well fits the case thats now in question
if with form and shew they prove her slaved all freedome i'le forgo
noble virginius put out a bold and confident defence search the imposture like a cunning tryer false me als bear the touch but brook not fire their brittleness betrayes them let your breath discover as much shame in them as death did ever draw from offenders
let your truth nobly supported void of fear or art welcome what ever comes with a great heart
now by the gods i thank thee noble youth
i never fear'd in a besieged town mines or great engines like you lawyers gown
o my dear lord and father once you gave me a noble freedom do not see it lost without a forfeit take the life you gave me and sacrifice it rather to the gods then to a villains lust
happy the wretch who born in bondage lives and dies a slave and sees no lustful projects bent upon her and neither knowes the life nor death of honor
icil we have neither justice no nor violence which should reform corruption sufficient to cross their black premeditated doom
appius will seize her all the fire in hell is leapt into his bosom
o you gods extinguish it with your compassionate tears although you make a second deluge spread and swell more high then tenerif 's high head
have not the wars heapt snow sufficient upon this aged head but they will stil pile winter upon winter

pray pardon it app
where is your advocate

truth needs no advocate the unjust cause buyes up the tongues that travel with applause in these your thronged courts
i want not any and count him the most wretched that needs many
may it please your reverend lordships
what are you sir
of counsel with my clyent marcus clodius
my lord i undertake a desperate combat to cope with this most eloquent lawyer i have no skill i'th' weapon good my lord i mean i am not travell'd in your lawes
my suit is therefore by your special goodness they be not wrested against me
o virginius the gods defend they should
your humble servant shall ever pray for you
thus shall your glory be above your place or those high titles which you hold in court for they dy blest that dy in good report
now sir i stand you
then have at you sir
may it please your lordships here is such a case so full of subtilty and as it were so far benighted in an ignorant mist that though my reading be sufficient my practice more i never was intangled in the like pursenet
here is one that claimes this woman for his daughter
heres another affirms she is his bond slave
now the question with favour of the bench i shall make plain in two words only without circumstance
fall to your proofs
where are our papers
i vow y'are the most tedious clyent
now we come to't my lord
thus stands the case the law is clear on our sides
that honourable lord virginius having been married about fifteen year and issuless this virgins politick mother seeing the land was likely to descend to numitorius
i pray sir listen
you my lord numitorius attend we are on your side
old virginius imployed in forraign wars she se him she was with child observe it i beseech you and note the trick of a deceitful woman she in the mean time fai the passions of a great b llyed woman counter s their passions and their and verily all rome held this for no posterous stuff
what's to be done now
heres a rumor spread of a young heir gods bless it and belly bumbasted with a cushion but their wants what wants there
nothing but a pretty babe bought with some piece of mony where it skils not to furnish this supposed lying in
nurse i protest my lord the fellow i'th' night cap hath not spoke one true word yet
app hold you your prating woman til you are call'd
from this mans bond woman the mony paid
what was the sum of mony
good a thousand drachmas
where is that bond woman
she's dead my lord
o dead that makes your cause suspicious
but here's her deposition on her death bed with other testimony to confirm what we have said is true
wilt please your lordship take pains to view these writings
here my lord we shall not need to hold your lordships long we'l make short work on't
if that your claim be just how happens it that you have discontinued it the space of fourteen years
i shall resolve your lordship
i vow this is a practis'd dialogue comes it not rarely off
peace give them leave
'tis very true this gentleman at first thought to conceal this accident and did so only reveal'd his knowledg to the mother of this fair bond woman who bought his silence during her life time with great sums of coyn
where are your proofs of that
here my good lord with depositions likewi
for your question of discontinuance
put case my slave run away from me dwell in some near city the space of twenty years and there grow rich it is in my discretion by your favor to seize him when i please
cast not your nobler beams you reverend judges on such a putrified dunghil
by your favour you shall be heard anon
my lords believe not this spruce orator
had i but fee'd him first he would have told as smooth a tale on our side
he deals in formal glosses cunning showes and cares not greatly which way the case goes examine i beseech you this old woman who is the truest witness of her birth
soft you is she your only witness
she is my lord
why is it possible such a great lady in her time of child birth should have no other witness but a nurse
for ought i know the rest are dead my lord
no my lord belike they were of counsel with your deceased lady and so sham'd twice to give colour to so vile an act
thou nurse observe me thy offence already doth merit punishment beyond our censure pull not more whips upon thee
i defie your whips my lord
command her silence lictors
you frown away my witness is this law
have you viewed the writings
this is a trick to make our slaves our heirs beyond prevention
appius wilt thou hear me
you have standred a sweet lady that now sleeps in a most noble monument
observe me i would have ta'ne her simple word to gage before his soul or thine
that makes thee wretched
old man i am sorry for thee that thy love by custome is growne natural which by nature should be an absolute loathing
note the sparrow that having hatch'd a cucko when it sees her brood a monster to her proper kind forsakes it and with more fear shuns the nest then she had care i'th' spring to have it drest
cast thy affection then behind thy back and think
be wise take counsel of your friends
you have many souldiers in their time of service father strange children
true and pleaders too when they are sent to visit provinces
you my most neat and cunning orator whose tongue is quick silver pray thee good janus look not so many several wayes at once but go to th' point
i will and keep you out at points end though i am no souldier
first the oath of the deceased bond woman
a very vertuous matron
join'd with the testimony of clodius
a most approved honest gentleman
besides six other honest gentlemen
all knights and there's no question but their oaths will go for currant
see my reverend lords and wonder at a case so evident
my lord i knew it
observe my lord how their own policy confounds them
had your lordship yesterday proceeded as 'twas fit to a just sentence the aparrel and the jewels that she wore more worth then all her tribe had then been due unto our client now to cosen him of such a forfeit see they bring the maid in her most proper habit bond slave like and they will save by th' hand too
please your lordships i crave a sentence
now by the gods here's juggling
who cannot counterfeit a dead mans hand
or hire some villain to swear forge ies
clodius was brought up in your house my lord and that's suspicious
how is't probable that our wife being present at the child birth whom this did nearest concern should nere reveal it
or if ours dealt thus cunningly how haps it her policy as you term it did not rather provide an issue male to chear the father
i'l answer each particular
it needs not heres witness most sufficient witness
think you my lord our lawes are writ in snow and that your breath can melt them
no my lord we have not such hot livers mark you that
remember yet the gods o appius who have no part in this
thy violent lust shall like the biting of the invenom'd aspick steal thee to hell
so subtil are thy evils in life they'l seem good angels in death divels
observe you not this scandal
i'l show thy letters full of violent lust sent to this lady
wilt thou breath a lye 'fore such a reverend audience
that place is sanctuary to thee
see here they are
my lords these are but dilatory shifts
sirrah i know you to the very heart and i'l observe you
do but do it with justice
clear thy self first o appius ere thou judg our imperfections rashly for we wot the office of a justice is perverted quite when one thief hangs another
you are too bold
lictors take charge of him▪ icil
will no man view these papers
jove thou hast found a rival upon earth his nod strikes all men dumb
my duty to you
the ass that carried sis on his back thought that the superstitious people kneel'd to give his dulnesse humble reverence
if thou thinkst so proud judg i let thee see i bend low to thy gown but not to thee
there's one in hold already
noble youth fetters grace one being worn for speaking truth i'l lye with thee i swear though in a dungeon the injuries you do us we shall pardon but it is just the wrongs which we forgive the gods are charg'd therewith to see revenged
come y'are a proud pleb ian
proud in the glory of my ancestors who have continued these eight hundred years the heralds have not knowne you these eight months
your madness wrongs you by my soul i love you
o thy opinion old pythagoras whither o whither should thy black soul fly into what ravenous bird or beast most vile
only into a weeping crocodile
thou loy'st me appius as the earth loves rain thou fain wouldst swallow me
know you the place you speak in
good men too much trusting their innocence do not betake them to that just defence which gods and nature gave them but even wink in the black tempest and so fondly sink
let us proceed to sentence
ere you speak one parting farwel let me borrow of you to take of my virginia
now my lords we shall have fair confession of the truth
pray take your course
farewel my sweet virginia never never shall i taste fruit of the most blessed hope i had in thee
let me forget the thought of thy most pretty infancy when first returning from the wars i took delight to rock thee in my target when my girl would kiss her father in his burganet of glittering steel hung'bout his armed neck and viewing the bright mettal smile to see another fair virginia smile on thee
when i first taught thee how to go to speak and when my wounds have smarted i have sung with an unskilful yet a willing voice to bring my girl asleep
o my virginia when we begun to be begun our woes increasing still as dying life still growes
this tediousness doth much offend the court
silence attend her sentence
hold without sentence i'l resign her freely since you will prove her to be none of mine
see see how evidently truth appears
thus i surrender her into the court kills her
of all the gods
and see proud appius see although not justly i have made her free
and if thy lust with this act be not fed bury her in thy bowels now shee's dead
lay hand upon the murderer
oh for a ring of pikes to circle me
have i stood the brunt of thousand enemies here to be slain by hang men
i'l fly to safety in the camp
some pursue the villain others take up the body
madness and rage are still th' attendants of old doting age
is our hut swept clean
as i can make it
'tis betwixt us two but how many think'st thou bred of roman blood did lodg with us last night
more i think then the camp hath enemies they are not to be numbred
comrague i fear appius will doom us to acteons death to be worried by the cattel that we feed
how goes the day
my stomack has struck twelve
come see what provant our knapsack yeilds
this is our store our garner
a smal pit ance
feeds appius thus is this a city feast
this crust doth taste like date stones and this thing if i knew what to call it
i can tell you cheese struck in years
i do not think but this same crust was bak'd and this cheese frighted out of milk and whey before we two were souldiers though it be old i see 't can crawl what living things be these that walk so freely 'tween the ind and pith
for here's no sap left
they call them gentles
therefore 'tis thought fit that souldiers by profession gentlemen should thus be fed with gentles
i am stomack sick i must have some strong water
where will you hav't
in you green ditch a place which none can pass but he must stop his nose thou know'st it well there where the two dead dogs lye
and see the cat that lyes a distance off be flead for supper
though we dine to day as dutch men feed their souldiers we will sup bravely like roman leaguerers
wee'l give him place but tell none of our dainties lest we have too many guests to supper
enter minutius with his souldiers reading a letter
most sure 'tis so it cannot otherwise be either virginius is degenerate from the ancient vertues he was wont to boast or in some strange displeasure with the senate why should these letters else from appius confine him a close prisoner to the camp
and which confirmes his guilt why should he fly
needs then must i incur some high displeasure for negligence to let him thus escape which to excuse and that it may appear i have no band with him but am of faction oppos'd in all things to the least mildeed i will casheir him and his tribuneship bestow upon some noble gentleman belonging to the camp
souldiers and friends you that beneath virginius colours march by strict command from the decemvirat we take you from the charge of him late and his authority command and honour we give this worthy roman
know his colours and prove his faithful souldiers
warlike general my courage and my forwardnesse in battel shal plead how well i can deserve the title to bee a roman tribune
enter the first mutinous souldier in haste
virginius in a strange shape of distraction enters the campe and at his heels a legion of all estates growths ages and degrees with breathlesse paces dog his frighted steps
it seemes half roo 's unpeopled with a traine that either for some mischiefe done pursue him or to attend some uncouth novelty
some wonder our fear promises
worthy souldiers martial your selves and entertaine this novel within a ring of steele wall in this portent with men and harnesse be it ne're so dreadful
hee's entred by the clamour of the camp that entertaines him with these ecchoing showts
affection that in souldiers hearts is bred survives the wounded and out lives the dead
enter virginius with his knife that and his arms stript up to the elbowes all bloudy coming into the midst of the soul∣diers he makes a stand
have i in all this populous assembly of souldiers that have prov'd virginius valour one friend
let him come thrill his partisan against this brest that through a large wide wound my mighty soule might rush out of this prison to flie more freely to yon christal pallace where honour sits inthronis'd
can this great multitude then yeild an enemy that hates my life
here let him seise it freely
what no man strike
am i so wel beloved
minutius then to thee
if in this camp there lives one man so just to punish sin so charitable to redeem from torments a wretched souldier at his worthy hand a death
o if the generals heart be so obdu to an old begging souldier have i here no honest legionary of mine own troo at whose bold hand and sword if not
i may command a death
virginius you have no command at all your companies are elsewhere now bestowed
besides we have a charge to you here
and make you the camps prisoner
for thou hast done as much with one harsh word as i beg'd from their weapons
thou hast kill'd me but with a living death
besides i charge you to speak what means this ugly face of blood you put on your distractions
whats the reason all rome pursues you covering those high as if they dog'd you for some damned act
what have you done
i have plaid the pa cide kill'd mine own child minut
these rude hands ript her and her innocent blood flow'd above my elbowes
willingly with advice premeditation and settled purpose and see still i wear her crimson colours and these withered armes are dy'd in her heart blood
i lov'd her life
lend me amongst you one speaking organ to discourse her death it is too harsh an imposition to lay upon a father
love her and murder her
yes give me but a little leave to a few red tears for souldiers should weep blood and i'l agree them well
alas might i have kept her chaste and free this life so oft ingag'd for ingrateful rome lay in her bosom
but when i saw her pull'd by appius lictors to be claim'd a sl ve and drag'd unto a publick sessions house divorc'd from her fore spousals with icilius a noble youth and made a bond woman inforc'd by violence from her fathers armes to be a prostiture and permour to the rude twinings of a leacherous judge then then o loving souldiers i'l not deny it for 'twas mine honor my pa ernal pity and the sole act for which i love my life
then lustful appius he that swayes the land slew poor virginia by this fathers hand
to you i appeal you are my sentencers did appius right or poor virginius wrong
sentence my fact with a free general tongue
appius is the parricide
virginins guiltless of his daughters death
it this be true virginius as the moan of all the roman fry that followes you confirmes at large this cause is to be pityed and should not dy revengelesse
noble minutius thou hast a daughter thou hast a wife too so most of yôu have souldiers
why might not this have hapned you
which of you all deer friends but now even now may have your wives deflowred your daughters slav'd and made a lictors prey
think them not safe in rome for mine lived there
it is a common cause
appius shall dy for't
lets make virginius general
a general a general lets make virginius general
it shall be so
virginius take my charge the wrongs are thine so violent and so weighty that none but he that lost fo a child knowes how to punish
by the gods of rome virginius shall succeed my full command
what's honor unto me a weak old man weary of life and covetous of a grave
i am a dead man now virginia lives not the self same hand that dar'd to save from shame a child dares in the father the ill himself
stay noble general minut
you much for nge virginias
who if you dye will take your ause in hand and proscribe appius should you p ish thus
soldiers so ought you
i'm out of fear my noble wife's expir'd my daughter of blest memory the object of appius lust lives the ely an vestals my house yeilds none fit for his lictors spoil
you that have wives lodg'd in you prison rome have lands unri ed houses yet your freeborn daughters yet unstrumpeted prevent these mischiefs yet while you have time
we will by you our noble general
he that was destin'd to preserve great rome
i accept your ch ▪ in hope to guard you all from my inhumane sufferings
be my pride that i have bred a daughter whose chast blood was spilt for you and for romes la ing good
v enter opius a senator and the advocate
how will you bear you in this turbule state
you are a member of that wretched faction
i wonder how you scape imprisonment
let me alone i have learnt with the wi hed og
to stop my cave that way the pest drives
never did bear whelp bling down a hill with more art shrink his head betwixt his clawes then i will work my safety appius is in the sand already up to th' chin and shal i hazard landing on that shelf
hee's a wise friend that first himself
what is your course of
marry this virginius with his troops is entering rome and it is like that in the market place my icilius and himself shall meet
now to encounter these two such great armies where lies my court of guard
why in your heels
there are strange dogs uncoupled
you are deceiv'd i have studied a most eloquent oration that shall applaud their fortune and distaste the cruelty of appius
it seems then you will rail upon your lord your late good benefactor
by the way sir
protest virginia was no bond woman and read her noble pedigree
by the way sir
could you not by the way too find occasion to beg lord appius lands
and by the way perchance i will
for i will gull them all most palbably
indeed you have the art of flattery
of rhetorick you would say
and i'l begin my smooth oration thus most learned captains
fie fie thats horrible most of your captains
yet i assure you most of them know arithmatick so well that in a muster to preserve dead payes they i make twelve stand for twenty
then i proceed i do applaud your fortunes and commend in this your observation noble shake rags
the helmet shall no more harbour the spider but it shall serve to carowse sack and sider
the rest within i'l study
farewel proteus and i shall wish thy eloquent bravado may sh ild thee from the whip and eastinado
now in this furious tempest let us glide with foulded sails at pleasure of the tyde
enter icilius horatio valerius numitorius at o door with souldiers virginius minutius and others at the other doore
a p rly with virginius
we wil not trust our general 'twixt the armies but upon terms of hostage
nor we our general who for the leaguer
minutius and numi∣torius meet embrace sa∣lute the generals
who for the city
how is it with your sorrow noble brother
i am forsaken of the gods old man
preach not that wretched doctrine to your self it wil beget despaire
what doe you call a burning feaver
is not that a divel
it shakes me like an earthquake
wilt a wilt a give me some wine
o it is hurtful for you
are all things that the appetite of man doth covet in his perfect'st health what ever art or nature have invented to make the boundlesse wish of man contented are all his poison
give me the wine there
do you grudge me a poor cup of drink
now by the gods i'll leave enough behind me to pay my debts and for the rest no matter who scrambles for't
here my noble brother i alas your hand shakes
i will guide it to you
'tis true it trembles
welcome thou just palsie 'twere pity this should doe me longer service now it hath slain my daughter
so i thank you now i have lost all comforts in the world it seems i must a little longer live bee't but to serve my belly
o my lord this violent feaver took him late last night since when the cruelty of the disease hath drawn him into sundry passions beyond his wonted temper
'tis the gods have powred their justice on him
you are sadly met my lord
would we had met in a cold grave together two months since i should not then have curst you
old man thou hast shewed thy self a noble roman but an unnatural father thou hast turned my bridal to a funeral
what divel did arme thy fury with the lions paw the dragons taile with the bulls double horne the cormorants beak the cockatrices eyes the scorpions teeth
and all these by a father to be imployed upon his innocent child
young man i love thy true description i am happy now that one beside my selfe doth teach me for this act
yet were i pleased i cou'd approve the deed most just and noble and sure posterity which truely renders to each man his desert shal praise me for't
come 'twas unnatural and damnable
you need not interrupt me
here's a fury wil doe it for you
you are a roman knight
what was your oath when you receiv'd your knighthood
a parcel of it is as i rememember rather to die with honour then to live in servitude
had my poor girle been ravish'd in her dishonour and in my sad griefe your love and pity quickly had ta'ne end
great mens misfortunes thus have ever stood they touch none neerly but their neerest blood
what do you meane to do
it seems my lord now you have caught the sword within your hand like a madman you'le draw it to offend those that best love you and perhaps the counsel of some loose unthrifts and vile male contents hearten you to't goe to take your course my faction shal not give the least advantage to murtherers to banquerouts or theeves to fleece the common wealth
do you term us so
shal i reprove your rage or is't your malice
he that would tame a lion doth not use the goad or wierd whip but a sweet voice a fearful stroaking and with food in hand must ply his wanton hunger
virg want of sleep wil do it better then all these my lord
i would not have you wake for others ruine lest you turn mad with watching
you are now a general learn to know your place and use your noble calling modestly
better had appius been an upright judg and yet an evil man then honest man and yet a dissolute judg for all disgrace lights lesse upon the person then the place
you are i'th' city now where if you raise but the least uproare even your fathers house shal not be free from ransack
piteous fires that chance in towrs of stone are not so feared as those that light in flax shops for there's food for eminent ruin
o my noble lord
let not your passion bring a fatal end to such a good beginning
all the world shal honour that deed in him which first grew to a reconcilement
come my lord i love your friendship yes in sooth i do but wil not seale it with that bloody hand
joine we our armies
no phantastick copy or borrowed president wil i assume in my revenge
there's hope yet you may live to outwear this sorrow
a minutes joy to me would quite crosse nature as those that long have dwelt in noisome rooms swoun presently if they but scent perfumes
come no more of this sad tale for such a tel tale may we term our grief and doth as 'twere so listen to her own words envious of others sleep because shee wakes
i ever would converse with a griev'd person in a longe journey to beguile the day or winter evening to passe time away
march on and let proud appius in our view like a tree rotted fall that way he grew
enter appius and marcus clodius in prison fett red and gyved
the world is chang'd now
all damnations seize on the hydra headed multitude that only gape for innovation
o who would trust a people
nay who would not rather then one rear'd on a popular suffrage whose station's built on avees and applause
there's no firm structure on these airy bases
o fie upon such greatness
the same ands that yesterday to hear me conscionate
and orarorize rung shril plaudits forth in sign of grace now in contempt and scorn hurry me to this place of darkness
could not their poisons rather spend themselves on th' judges folly but must it needs stretch to me his servant and sweep me along
curse on the inconstant rabble
grieves it thee to impart my sad disaster
thou shared'st a fortune with me in my greatness i ha 'd thee after when i climb my state and shrink'st thou at my ruine
i loved your greatness and would have trac'd you in the golden path of sweet promotion but this your decline sowrs all these hoped sweets
'tis the world right
such gratitude a great man still shall have that trusts unto a temporizing slave
which of us two in our dejection is basest
i am most sure your loathsome dungeon is as dark as mine your conscience for a thousand sentences wrongly denounc'd much more opprest then mine
then which is the most slave▪ app
o double baseness to hear a drudg thus with his lord compare
great men disgrac'd slaves to their servants are
enter virginius icilius minutius numitoriut horatio valerius opius with souldiers
souldiers keep a strong guard whilst we survey our sentenc'd prisoners and from this deep dungeon keep off that great concourse whose violent hands would ruine this stone building and drag hence this impious judg peice▪ meal to tear his limbs before the law convince him
see these monsters whose fronts the fair virginias innocent blood hath visarded with such black ugliness that they are loathsome to all good mens souls
speak damn'd judg how canst thou purge thy self from lust and blood
i do confess my self guilty of both yet hear me noble romans virginius thou dost but supply my place i thine
fortune hath lift thee to my chair and thrown me headlong to thy pleading bar
if in mine eminence i was stern to thee shunning my rigor likewise shun my fall
and being mild where i shewed cruelty establish still thy greatness
make some use of this my bondage
with indifference survey me and comp e my yesterday with this sad hour my heighth with my decline and give them equal ballance
u certain fate but yesterday his breath 'd rome and his least ved frown was death i cannot chuse but pity and lament so high a rise should have such low discent
he's ready to forget his injury
oh too relenting age
thinks not virginius if he should pardon appius this black deed and set him once more in the ivory chair he would be wary to avoid the like become a new man a more upright judge and deserve better of the common weal
'tis like he would
nay if you thus begin i'l fetch that shall anatomize his
virginius you are oo to deeds of this nature
you must fashion now your actions to your place not to your passion severity to such acts is as necessary as pity to the tears of innocence
he speaks but law and justice
make good the streets with your best men at arms valerius and horatio know the reason of this loud uproar and confused noise
although my heart be melting at the fall of men in place and office we'l be just to punish murdrous acts and censure lust
enter valerius and horatio
icilius worthy lord bears through the street the body of virginia towards this prison which when it was discovered to the people mov'd such a mournful clamour that their cryes pierc'd heaven and forc'd tears from their sorrowing eyes
enter icilius with the body of virginia
where was thy pity when thou slewest this maid thou wouldst extend to appius
see her wounds still bleeding at the horrid presence of you stern murderer till she find revenge nor will these drops stench or these springs be dry till theirs be set a bleeding shall her soul whose essence some suppose lives in the blood still labour without rest
will old virginius murder her once again in this delay
this sight hath stiffned all my operant powers ic'd all my blood benum'd my motion quite
i'l powre my soul into my daughters belly and with a soldiers tears imbalm her wounds
my only dear virginia
leave this passion proceed to your just sentence
give me two sword
appius grasp this you clodius that
you shall be your own hang men do justice on your selves
uce his own blood lodg'd in his daughters brest which your own hands shall act upon your selves
if you be romans and retain their spirits redeem a base life with a noble death and through your yo ath
virginius is a noble justicer had i my crooked paths levell'd by thine
i had not swayed the ballance
think not lords but he that had the s it to oppose the gods dares likewise suffer what their powers inflict i have not dreaded famine fire no strage their common vengeance poison in my cup nor dagger in my bosom the revenge of private men for private injuries nay more then these not fe 'd to commit evil and shall i tremble at the punishment
now with as much resolved constancy as i offended will i pay the mulct and this black stain laid on my family then which a nobler hath not place in rome wash with my blood away
learn of me clodius i'l teach thee what thou never studiest yet thats bravely how to dy
judges are term'd the gods on earth and such as are corrupt read me in this my ruine
those that succeed me that so offend thus punish
this the sum of all appius that in'd by appius hand shall fall
he dyed as boldly as he basely err'd and so should every true bred roman do
and he whose lise was odious thus expiring in his death forceth pity
clodius thou wast follower of his fortunes in his being therefore in his not being imitate his fair example
death is terrible unto a conscience that's opprest with guilt
they say there is elizium and hel the first i have forfeited the latter fear
my skin is not sword proof
why dost thou pawse
for mercy mercy i intreat you all
is't not sufficient for virginia slain that appius suffered one of noble blood and eminence in place for a plebian
besides he was my lord and might command me if i did ought 'twas by compulsion lords and therefore i crave mercy
shall i doom him
then i sentence thus thou hadst a mercy most unme riting slave of which thy base birth was not capable which we take off by taking thence thy sword
and note the difference 'twixt a noble strain and one bred from the rabble both alike da 'd to transgresse but see their odds in death appius dy'd like a roman gentleman and a man both wayes knowing but this slave is only sensible of vitious living not apprehensive of a noble death
therefore as a base malefactor we and timerous slave give him as he deserves unto the common hangman
stop's mouth away with him the life of the decemviri expires in them
rome thou at length art free restored unto thine ancient liberty
of consu which bold iunius brutus first begun in tarquins fall
virginius you and young icilius shall his place succeed so by the peoples suffrage 'tis decreed
we martial then our souldiers in that name of consuls honoured with these golden bayes
two fair but ladies most infortunate have in their ruins rais'd declining rome lucretia and virginia both renown'd▪ for chastity
souldiers and noble romans to grace her death whose life hath freed great rome march with her course to her sad funeral tomb
