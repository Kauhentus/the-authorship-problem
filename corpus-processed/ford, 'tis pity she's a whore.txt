dispute no more in this for know young man these are no school points nice philosophy may tolerate unlikely arguments but heaven admits no jest wits that presumed on wit too much by striving how to prove there was no god with foolish grounds of art discover'd first the nearest way to hell and fill'd the world with devilish atheism
such questions youth are fond far better 'tis to bless the sun than reason why it shines yet he thou talk'st of is above the sun
i may not hear it
gentle father to you i have unclasp'd my burden'd soul emptied the storehouse of my thoughts and heart made myself poor of secrets have not left another word untold which hath not spoke all what i ever durst or think or know and yet is here the comfort i shall have
must i not do what all men else may love
yes you may love fair son
must i not praise that beauty which if fram'd anew the gods would make a god of if they had it there and kneel to it as i do kneel to them
shall a peevish sound a customary form from man to man of brother and of sister be a bar 'twixt my perpetual happiness and me
say that we had one father say one womb curse to my joys
gave both us life and birth are we not therefore each to other bound so much the more by nature
by the links of blood of reason
nay if you will have it even of religion to be ever one one soul one flesh one love one heart one all
have done unhappy youth
for thou art lost
shall then for that i am her brother born my joys be ever banished from her bed
no father in your eyes i see the change of pity and compassion from your age as from a sacred oracle distils the life of counsel tell me holy man what cure shall give me ease in these extremes
repentance son and sorrow for this sin for thou hast mov'd a majesty above with thy unranged almost blasphemy
oh do not speak of that dear confessor
art thou my son that miracle of wit who once within these three months wert esteem'd a wonder of thine age throughout bononia
how did the university applaud thy government behaviour learning speech sweetness and all that could make up a man
i was proud of my tutelage and chose rather to leave my books than part with thee i did so but the fruits of all my hopes are lost in thee as thou art in thyself
hast thou left the schools of knowledge to converse with lust and death
for death waits on thy lust
look through the world and thou shalt see a thousand faces shine more glorious than this idol thou ador'st leave her and take thy choice 'tis much less sin though in such games as those they lose that win
it were more easy to stop the ocean from floats and ebbs than to dissuade my vows
then i have done and in thy wilful flames already see thy ruin heaven is just
yet hear my counsel
as a voice of life
hie to thy father's house there lock thee fast alone within thy chamber then fall down on both thy knees and grovel on the ground cry to thy heart wash every word thou utter'st in tears and if 't be possible of blood beg heaven to cleanse the leprosy of lust that rots thy soul acknowledge what thou art a wretch a worm a nothing weep sigh pray three times a day and three times every night for seven days space do this then if thou find'st no change in thy desires return to me i'll think on remedy
pray for thyself at home whilst i pray for thee here
my blessing with thee
we have need to pray
all this i'll do to free me from the rod of vengeance else i'll swear my fate's my god
enter grimaldi and vasques with their swords drawn
come sir stand to your tackling if you prove craven i'll make you run quickly
thou art no equal match for me
indeed i never went to the wars to bring home news nor i cannot play the mountebank for a meal's meat and swear i got my wounds in the field
see you these grey hairs
they'll not flinch for a bloody nose
wilt thou to this gear
why slave think'st thou i'll balance my reputation with a cast− suit
call thy master he shall know that i dare scold like a cot−quean that's your profession
thou poor shadow of a soldier i will make thee know my master keeps servants thy betters in quality and performance
com'st thou to fight or prate
i am a roman and a gentleman one that have got mine honour with expense of blood
you are a lying coward and a fool
fight or by these hilts i'll kill thee brave my lord
provoke me not for if thou dost have at you
they fight grimaldi is worsted
enter florio donado and soranzo from opposite sides
what mean these sudden broils so near my doors
have you not other places but my house to vent the spleen of your disorder'd bloods
must i be haunted still with such unrest as not to eat or sleep in peace at home
is this your love grimaldi
and vasques i may tell thee 'tis not well to broach these quarrels you are ever forward in seconding contentions
enter above annabella and putana
that with your patience signiors i'll resolve this gentleman whom fame reports a soldier for else i know not rivals me in love to signior florio's daughter to whose ears he still prefers his suit to my disgrace thinking the way to recommend himself is to disparage me in his report
but know grimaldi though maybe thou art my equal in thy blood yet this betrays a lowness in thy mind which wert thou noble thou would'st as much disdain as i do thee for this unworthiness and on this ground i will'd my servant to correct his tongue holding a man so base no match for me
and had not your sudden coming prevented us i had let my gentleman blood under the gills i should have worm'd you sir for running mad
i'll be reveng'd soranzo
on a dish of warm broth to stay your stomach do honest innocence do
spoon−meat is a wholesomer diet than a spanish blade
i fear thee not grimaldi
my lord soranzo this is strange to me why you should storm having my word engaged owing her heart what need you doubt her ear
losers may talk by law of any game
yet the villainy of words signior florio may be such as would make any unspleened dove choleric
blame not my lord in this
be you more silent i would not for my wealth my daughter's love should cause the spilling of one drop of blood
vasques put up let's end this fray in wine
how like you this child
here's threatening challenging quarrelling and fighting on every side and all is for your sake you had need look to yourself charge you'll be stolen away sleeping else shortly
but tutoress such a life gives no content to me my thoughts are fix'd on other ends
would you would leave me
no marvel else leave me no leaving charge this is love outright
indeed i blame you not you have choice fit for the best lady in italy
pray do not talk so much
take the worst with the best there's grimaldi the soldier a very well−timber'd fellow
they say he's a roman nephew to the duke montferrato they say he did good service in the wars against the milanese but 'faith charge i do not like him an 't be for nothing but for being a soldier not one amongst twenty of your skirmishing captains but have some privy maim or other that mars their standing upright
i like him the worse he crinkles so much in the hams though he might serve if there were no more men yet he's not the man i would choose
fie how thou prat'st
as i am a very woman i like signior soranzo well he is wise and what is more rich and what is more than that kind and what is more than all this a nobleman such a one were i the fair annabella myself i would wish and pray for
then he is bountiful besides he is handsome and by my troth i think wholesome and that's news in a gallant of three−and− twenty liberal that i know loving that you know and a man sure else he could never have purchased such a good name with hippolita the lusty widow in her husband's lifetime
an 'twere but for that report sweetheart would he were thine
commend a man for his qualities but take a husband as he is a plain sufficient naked man such a one is for your bed and such a one is signior soranzo my life for 't
sure the woman took her morning's draught too soon
enter bergetto and poggio
but look sweetheart look what thing comes now
here's another of your ciphers to fill up the number oh brave old ape in a silken coat
didst thou think poggio that i would spoil my new clothes and leave my dinner to fight
no sir i did not take you for so arrant a baby
i am wiser than so for i hope poggio thou never heard'st of an elder brother that was a coxcomb didst poggio
never indeed sir as long as they had either land or money left them to inherit
is it possible poggio
why i'll undertake with a handful of silver to buy a headful of wit at any time but sirrah i have another purchase in hand i shall have the wench mine uncle says
i will but wash my face and shift socks and then have at her i' faith
mark my pace poggio
passes over the stage
sir i have seen an ass and a mule trot the spanish pavin with a better grace i know not how often
aside and following him
this idiot haunts me too
ay ay he needs no description
the rich magnifico that is below with your father charge signior donado his uncle for that he means to make this his cousin a golden calf thinks that you will be a right israelite and fall down to him presently but i hope i have tutored you better
they say a fool's bauble is a lady's play−fellow yet you having wealth enough you need not cast upon the dearth of flesh at any rate
giovanni passes over the stage
but see putana see
what blessed shape of some celestial creature now appears
what man is he that with such sad aspect walks careless of himself
oh 'tis your brother sweet
sure 'tis not he this is some woeful thing wrapp'd up in grief some shadow of a man
he beats his breast and wipes his eyes drown'd all in tears methinks i hear him sigh let's down putana and partake the cause
i know my brother in the love he bears me will not deny me partage in his sadness my soul is full of heaviness and fear
my fates have doom'd my death the more i strive i love the more i love the less i hope i see my ruin certain
what judgment or endeavours could apply to my incurable and restless wounds i thoroughly have examined but in vain
oh that it were not in religion sin to make our love a god and worship it
i have even wearied heaven with pray'rs dried up the spring of my continual tears even starv'd my veins with daily fasts what wit or art could counsel i have practised but alas
i find all these but dreams and old men's tales to fright unsteady youth i am still the same or i must speak or burst
'tis not i know my lust but 'tis my fate that leads me on
keep fear and low faint−hearted shame with slaves
i'll tell her that i love her though my heart were rated at the price of that attempt
enter annabella and putana
if such a thing as courage dwell in men ye heavenly powers now double all that virtue in my tongue
why brother will you not speak to me
yes how do you sister
howe'er i am methinks you are not well
why are you so sad sir
let me entreat you leave us a while putana
sister i would be private with you
−aside if this were any other company for her i should think my absence an office of some credit but i will leave them together
come sister lend your hand let's walk together i hope you need not blush to walk with me here's none but you and how's this
i ' faith i mean no harm
how is it with thee
i trust he be not frantic
aloud i am very well brother
trust me but i am sick i fear so sick 'twill cost my life
'tis not so i hope
i think you love me sister
yes you know i do
i know it indeed you are very fair
nay then i see you have a merry sickness
that's as it proves
the poets feign i read that juno for her forehead did exceed all other goddesses but i durst swear your forehead exceeds hers as hers did theirs
'troth this is pretty
such a pair of stars as are thine eyes would like promethean fire if gently glanced give life to senseless stones
the lily and the rose most sweetly strange upon your dimple cheeks do strive for change such lips would tempt a saint such hands as those would make an anchorite lascivious
do you mock me or flatter me
if you would see a beauty more exact than art can counterfeit or nature frame look in your glass and there behold your own
oh you are a trim youth
offers his dagger to her
and here's my breast strike home
rip up my bosom there thou shalt behold a heart in which is writ the truth i speak why stand you
my tortured soul hath felt affliction in the heat of death
oh annabella i am quite undone
the love of thee my sister and the view of thy immortal beauty have untuned all harmony both of my rest and life
why do you not strike
forbid it my just fears
if this be true 'twere fitter i were dead
annabella 'tis no time to jest
i have too long suppressed my hidden flames that almost have consum'd me i have spent many a silent night in sighs and groans ran over all my thoughts despised my fate reason'd against the reasons of my love done all that smooth−cheek'd virtue could advise but found all bootless 'tis my destiny that you must either love or i must die
comes this in sadness from you
let some mischief befall me soon if i dissemble aught
you are my brother giovanni
you my sister annabella i know this
and could afford you instance why to love so much the more for this to which intent wise nature first in your creation meant to make you mine else 't had been sin and foul to share one beauty to a double soul
nearness in birth and blood doth but persuade a nearer nearness in affection
i have ask'd counsel of the holy church who tells me i may love you and 'tis just that since i may i should and will yes will must i now live or die
live thou hast won the field and never fought what thou hast urged my captive heart had long ago resolv'd
i blush to tell thee but i'll tell thee now for every sigh that thou hast spent for me i have sigh'd ten for every tear shed twenty and not so much for that i loved as that i durst not say i loved nor scarcely think it
let not this music be a dream ye gods for pity's sake i beg you
on my knees she kneels
brother even by our mother's dust i charge you do not betray me to your mirth or hate love me or kill me brother
on my knees he kneels
sister even by my mother's dust i charge you do not betray me to your mirth or hate love me or kill me sister
you mean good sooth then
in good troth i do and so do you i hope say i'm in earnest
i'll swear it and i and by this kiss kisses her
once more yet once more now let's rise they rise by this i would not change this minute for elysium
what must we now do
come then after so many tears as we have wept let's learn to court in smiles to kiss and sleep
enter florio and donado
signior donado you have said enough i understand you but would have you know i will not force my daughter 'gainst her will
you see i have but two a son and her and he is so devoted to his book as i must tell you true i doubt his health should he miscarry all my hopes rely upon my girl
as for worldly fortune i am i thank my stars bless'd with enough
my care is how to match her to her liking i would not have her marry wealth but love and if she like your nephew let him have her here's all that i can say
sir you say well like a true father and for my part i if the young folks can like 'twixt you and me will promise to assure my nephew presently three thousand florins yearly during life
and after i am dead my whole estate
'tis a fair proffer sir meantime your nephew shall have free passage to commence his suit if he can thrive he shall have my consent so for this time i'll leave you signior
well here's hope yet if my nephew would have wit but he is such another dunce i fear he'll never win the wench
when i was young i could have done 't i' faith and so shall he if he will learn of me and in good time he comes himself
enter bergetto and poggio
how now bergetto whither away so fast
i have heard the strangest news that ever came out of the mint have i not poggio
why look ye uncle my barber told me just now that there is a fellow come to town who undertakes to make a mill go without the mortal help of any water or wind only with sandbags and this fellow hath a strange horse a most excellent beast i'll assure you uncle my barber says whose head to the wonder of all christian people stands just behind where his tail is
is 't not true poggio
so the barber swore forsooth
and you are running thither
wilt thou be a fool still
come sir you shall not go you have more mind of a puppet−play than on the business i told you why thou great baby wilt never have wit
wilt make thyself a may−game to all the world
answer for yourself master
why uncle should i sit at home still and not go abroad to see fashions like other gallants
what wise talk i pray had you with annabella when you were at signior florio's house
uds sa'me uncle i tickled her with a rare speech that i made her almost burst her belly with laughing
nay i think so and what speech was 't
what did i say poggio
forsooth my master said that he loved her almost as well as he loved parmasent and swore i'll be sworn for him that she wanted but such a nose as his was to be as pretty a young woman as any was in parma
nay uncle then she ask'd me whether my father had more children than myself
and i said no 'twere better he should have had his brains knock'd out first
then said she will signior donado your uncle leave you all his wealth
that was good did she harp upon that string
did she harp upon that string
ay that she did
i answered leave me all his wealth
why woman he hath no other wit if he had he should hear on 't to his everlasting glory and confusion i know" quoth i i am his white boy and will not be gull'd and with that she fell into a great smile and went away
nay i did fit her
ah sirrah then i see there's no changing of nature
well bergetto i fear thou wilt be a very ass still
i should be sorry for that uncle
come come you home with me since you are no better a speaker i'll have you write to her after some courtly manner and enclose some rich jewel in the letter
ay marry that will be excellent
once in my time i'll set my wits to school if all fail 'tis but the fortune of a fool
poggio 'twill do poggio
act enter giovanni and annabella
come annabella no more sister now but love a name more gracious do not blush beauty's sweet wonder but be proud to know that yielding thou hast conquer'd and inflamed a heart whose tribute is thy brother's life
and mine is his
oh how these stolen contents would print a modest crimson on my cheeks had any but my heart's delight prevail'd
i marvel why the chaster of your sex should think this pretty toy call'd maidenhead so strange a loss when being lost 'tis nothing and you are still the same
'tis well for you now you can talk
music as well consists in th' ear as in the playing
oh you are wanton
tell on 't you were best do
thou wilt chide me then
thus hung jove on leda's neck and suck'd divine ambrosia from her lips
i envy not the mightiest man alive but hold myself in being king of thee more great than were i king of all the world but i shall lose you sweetheart
but you shall not
you must be married mistress
some one must have you
now prithee do not speak so without jesting you'll make me weep in earnest
what you will not
but tell me sweet canst thou be dared to swear that thou wilt live to me and to no other
by both our loves i dare for didst thou know my giovanni how all suitors seem to my eyes hateful thou wouldst trust me then
enough i take thy word sweet we must part remember what thou vow'st keep well my heart
will you be gone
go where thou wilt in mind i'll keep thee here and where thou art i know i shall be there
child how is 't child
well thank heav'n ha
oh guardian what a paradise of joy have i passed over
nay what a paradise of joy have you passed under
why now i commend thee charge
fear nothing sweetheart what though he be your brother
your brother's a man i hope and i say still if a young wench feel the fit upon her let her take anybody father or brother all is one
i would not have it known for all the world
nor i indeed for the speech of the people else 'twere nothing
my father here sir reach my work
what are you doing
so let him come now
enter florio followed by richardetto as a doctor of physic and philotis with a lute
so hard at work
that's well you lose no time
look i have brought you company here's one a learned doctor lately come from padua much skill'd in physic and for that i see you have of late been sickly i entreated this reverend man to visit you some time
you are very welcome sir
i thank you mistress loud fame in large report hath spoke your praise as well for virtue as perfection for which i have been bold to bring with me a kinswoman of mine a maid for song and music one perhaps will give content please you to know her
they are parts i love and she for them most welcome
sir now you know my house pray make not strange and if you find my daughter need your art i'll be your paymaster
sir what i am she shall command
you shall bind me to you
daughter i must have conference with you about some matters that concern us both
good master doctor please you but walk in we'll crave a little of your cousin's cunning i think my girl hath not quite forgot to touch an instrument she could have done 't we'll hear them both
i'll wait upon you sir
enter soranzo with a book
love's measure is extreme the comfort pain the life unrest and the reward disdain
look 't o'er again
'tis so so writes this smooth licentious poet in his rhymes but sannazar thou ly'st for had thy bosom felt such oppression as is laid on mine thou wouldst have kiss'd the rod that made thee smart
to work then happy muse and contradict what sannazar hath in his envy writ
love's measure is the mean sweet his annoys his pleasures life and his reward all joys
had annabella liv'd when sannazar did in his brief encomium celebrate venice that queen of cities he had left that verse which gain'd him such a sum of gold and for one only look from annabel had writ of her and her diviner cheeks
oh how my thoughts are within
pray forbear in rules of civility let me give notice on 't i shall be tax'd of my neglect of duty and service
what rude intrusion interrupts my peace
can i be nowhere private
troth you wrong your modesty
what's the matter vasques
enter hippolita and vasques
'tis i do you know me now
look perjur'd man on her whom thou and thy distracted lust have wrong'd
thy sensual rage of blood hath made my youth a scorn to men and angels and shall i be now a foil to thy unsated change
thou know'st false wanton when my modest fame stood free from stain or scandal all the charms of hell or sorcery could not prevail against the honour of my chaster bosom
thine eyes did plead in tears thy tongue in oaths such and so many that a heart of steel would have been wrought to pity as was mine and shall the conquest of my lawful bed my husband's death urg'd on by his disgrace my loss of womanhood be ill−rewarded with hatred and contempt
no know soranzo i have a spirit doth as much distaste the slavery of fearing thee as thou dost loathe the memory of what hath passed
nay dear hippolita call me not dear nor think with supple words to smooth the grossness of my abuses 'tis not your new mistress your goodly madam−merchant shall triumph on my dejection tell her thus from me my birth was nobler and by much more free
you are too violent
you are too double in your dissimulation
seest thou this this habit these black mourning weeds of care
'tis thou art cause of this and hast divorced my husband from his life and me from him and made me widow in my widowhood
will you yet hear
more of thy perjuries
thy soul is drown'd too deeply in those sins thou need'st not add to th' number
then i'll leave you you are past all rules of sense
and thou of grace
fie mistress you are not near the limits of reason if my lord had a resolution as noble as virtue itself you take the course to unedge it all
sir i beseech you do not perplex her griefs alas will have a vent i dare undertake madam hippolita will now freely hear you
talk to a woman frantic
are these the fruits of your love
they are the fruits of thy untruth false man
didst thou not swear whilst yet my husband liv'd that thou wouldst wish no happiness on earth more than to call me wife
didst thou not vow when he should die to marry me
for which the devil in my blood and thy protests caus'd me to counsel him to undertake a voyage to ligorne for that we heard his brother there was dead and left a daughter young and unfriended whom with much ado i wish'd him to bring hither he did so and went and as thou know'st died on the way
unhappy man to buy his death so dear with my advice
yet thou for whom i did it forget'st thy vows and leav'st me to my shame
who could help this
thou couldst if thou hadst faith or love
you are deceived the vows i made if you remember well were wicked and unlawful 'twere more sin to keep them than to break them as for me i cannot mask my penitence
think thou how much thou hast digress'd from honest shame in bringing of a gentleman to death who was thy husband such a one as he so noble in his quality condition learning behaviour entertainment love as parma could not show a braver man
you do not well this was not your promise
i care not let her know her monstrous life
ere i'll be servile to so black a sin i'll be a curse
woman come here no more learn to repent and die for by my honour i hate thee and thy lust you have been too foul
this part has been scurvily play'd
how foolishly this beast contemns his fate and shuns the use of that which i more scorn than i once lov'd his love
but let him go my vengeance shall give comfort to his woe
mistress mistress madam hippolita pray a word or two
with you if you please
i know you are infinitely moved now and you think you have cause some i confess you have but sure not so much as you imagine
oh you were miserably bitter which you followed even to the last syllable 'faith you were somewhat too shrewd by my life you could not have took my lord in a worse time since i first knew him tomorrow you shall find him a new man
well i shall wait his leisure
fie this is not a hearty patience it comes sourly from you 'troth let me persuade you for once
i have it and it shall be so thanks opportunity
visit him in some milder temper
oh if you could but master a little your female spleen how might you win him
he will never love me
vasques thou hast been a too trusty servant to such a master and i believe thy reward in the end will fall out like mine
resolve thyself it will
had i one so true so truly honest so secret to my counsels as thou hast been to him and his i should think it a slight acquittance not only to make him master of all i have but even of myself
oh you are a noble gentlewoman
wilt thou feed always upon hopes
well i know thou art wise and seest the reward of an old servant daily what it is
true but vasques wert thou mine and wouldst be private to me and my designs i here protest myself and all what i can else call mine should be at thy dispose
work you that way old mole
then i have the wind of you
i were not worthy of it by any desert that could lie within my compass if i could what then
i should then hope to live in these my old years with rest and security
give me thy hand now promise but thy silence and help to bring to pass a plot i have and here in sight of heaven that being done i make thee lord of me and mine estate
come you are merry this is such a happiness that i can neither think nor believe
promise thy secrecy and 'tis confirm'd
then here i call our good genii for witnesses whatsoever your designs are or against whomsoever i will not only be a special actor therein but never disclose it till it be effected
i take thy word and with that thee for mine come then let's more confer of this anon
aside on this delicious bane my thought shall banquet revenge shall sweeten what my griefs have tasted
enter richardetto and philotis
thou seest my lovely niece these strange mishaps how all my fortunes turn to my disgrace wherein i am but as a looker−on whilst others act my shame and i am silent
but uncle wherein can this borrow'd shape give you content
i'll tell thee gentle niece thy wanton aunt in her lascivious riots lives now secure thinks i am surely dead in my late journey to ligorne for you as i have caus'd it to be rumour'd out
now would i see with what an impudence she gives scope to her loose adultery and how the common voice allows hereof thus far i have prevail'd
alas i fear you mean some strange revenge
oh be not troubled your ignorance shall plead for you in all but to our business
you learn'd for certain how signior florio means to give his daughter in marriage to soranzo
but how find you young annabella's love inclined to him
for aught i could perceive she neither fancies him nor any else
there's mystery in that which time must show
she us'd you kindly
and crav'd your company
'tis well it goes as i could wish
i am the doctor now and as for you none knows you if all fail not we shall thrive
but who comes here
i know him 'tis grimaldi a roman and a soldier near allied unto the duke of montferrato one attending on the nuncio of the pope that now resides in parma by which means he hopes to get the love of annabella
i have heard of your approved skill which through the city is freely talk'd of and would crave your aid
marry sir for this but i would speak in private
i love fair annabella and would know whether in arts there may not be receipts to move affection
sir perhaps there may but these will nothing profit you
unless i be mistook you are a man greatly in favour with the cardinal
in duty to his grace i will be bold to tell you if you seek to marry florio's daughter you must first remove a bar 'twixt you and her
soranzo is the man that hath her heart and while he lives be sure you cannot speed
is he your enemy
the man i hate worse than confusion i will tell him straight
nay then take my advice even for his grace's sake the cardinal i'll find a time when he and she do meet of which i'll give you notice and to be sure he shall not 'scape you i'll provide a poison to dip your rapier's point in if he had as many heads as hydra had he dies
but shall i trust thee doctor
as yourself doubt not in aught
thus shall the fates decree by me soranzo falls that ruin'd me
enter donado with a letter bergetto and poggio
well sir i must be content to be both your secretary and your messenger myself
i cannot tell what this letter may work but as sure as i am alive if thou come once to talk with her i fear thou wilt mar whatsoever i make
why am not i big enough to carry mine own letter i pray
ay ay carry a fool's head of thy own
why thou dunce wouldst thou write a letter and carry it thyself
yes that i would and read it to her with mine own mouth for you must think if she will not believe me myself when she hears me speak she will not believe another's handwriting
oh you think i am a blockhead uncle
no sir poggio knows i have indited a letter myself so i have
yes truly sir i have it in my pocket
a sweet one no doubt pray let's see it
i cannot read my own hand very well poggio read it poggio
most dainty and honey−sweet mistress i could call you fair and lie as fast as any that loves you but my uncle being the elder man i leave it to him as more fit for his age and the colour of his beard
i am wise enough to tell you i can board where i see occasion or if you like my uncle's wit better than mine you shall marry me if you like mine better than his i will marry you in spite of your teeth
so commending my best parts to you i rest yours upwards and downwards or you may choose
here's stuff indeed to shame us all
pray whose advice did you take in this learned letter
none upon my word but mine own
and mine uncle believe it nobody's else 'twas mine own brain i thank a good wit for 't
get you home sir and look you keep within doors till i return
that were a jest indeed
i scorn it i' faith
judge me but i do now
indeed sir 'tis very unhealthy
well sir if i hear any of your apish running to motions and fopperies till i come back you were as good not look to 't
poggio shall's steal to see this horse with the head in's tail
ay but you must take heed of whipping
dost take me for a child poggio
enter friar and giovanni
thou hast told a tale whose every word threatens eternal slaughter to the soul i'm sorry i have heard it would mine ears had been one minute deaf before the hour that thou cam'st to me
oh young man castaway by the religious number of mine order i day and night have wak'd my aged eyes above my strength to weep on thy behalf but heaven is angry and be thou resolv'd thou art a man remark'd to taste a mischief
look for 't though it come late it will come sure
father in this you are uncharitable what i have done i'll prove both fit and good
it is a principle which you have taught when i was yet your scholar that the frame and composition of the mind doth follow the frame and composition of the body
so where the body's furniture is beauty the mind's must needs be virtue which allow'd virtue itself is reason but refined and love the quintessence of that this proves my sister's beauty being rarely fair is rarely virtuous chiefly in her love and chiefly in that love her love to me if hers to me then so is mine to her since in like causes are effects alike
oh ignorance in knowledge
long ago how often have i warn'd thee this before
indeed if we were sure there were no deity nor heaven nor hell then to be led alone by nature's light as were philosophers of elder times might instance some defence
but 'tis not so then madman thou wilt find that nature is in heaven's positions blind
your age o'errules you had you youth like mine you'd make her love your heaven and her divine
nay then i see thou 'rt too far sold to hell it lies not in the compass of my prayers to call thee back yet let me counsel thee persuade thy sister to some marriage
why that's to damn her that's to prove her greedy of variety of lust
if thou wilt not give me leave to shrive her lest she should die unabsolved
at your best leisure father then she'll tell you how dearly she doth prize my matchless love then you will know what pity 'twere we two should have been sunder'd from each other's arms
view well her face and in that little round you may observe a world's variety for colour lips for sweet perfumes her breath for jewels eyes for threads of purest gold hair for delicious choice of flowers cheeks
wonder in every portion of that throne
hear her but speak and you will swear the spheres make music to the citizens in heaven
but father what is else for pleasure fram'd lest i offend your ears shall go unnam'd
the more i hear i pity thee the more that one so excellent should give those parts all to a second death
what i can do is but to pray and yet i could advise thee wouldst thou be ruled
why leave her yet the throne of mercy is above your trespass yet time is left you both to embrace each other else let all time be struck quite out of number she is like me and i like her resolv'd
i'll visit her this grieves me most things being thus a pair of souls are lost
enter florio donado annabella and putana
newly walk'd abroad and as i heard him say gone to the friar his reverend tutor

but 'twere better you had tickled her in another place
sirrah sweetheart i'll tell thee a good jest and riddle what it is
you say you'll tell me
as i was walking just now in the street i met a swaggering fellow would needs take the wall of me and because he did thrust me i very valiantly call'd him rogue he hereupon bade me draw i told him i had more wit than so but when he saw that i would not he did so maul me with the hilts of his rapier that my head sung whilst my feet caper'd in the kennel
was ever the like ass seen
and what did you all this while
laugh at him for a gull till i saw the blood run about mine ears and then i could not choose but find in my heart to cry till a fellow with a broad beard they say he is a new−come doctor call'd me into his house and gave me a plaster look you here 'tis and sir there was a young wench wash'd my face and hands most excellently i' faith i shall love her as long as i live for it did she not poggio
yes and kiss'd him too
why la now you think i tell a lie uncle i warrant
would he that beat thy blood out of thy head had beaten some wit into it
for i fear thou never wilt have any
oh uncle but there was a wench would have done a man's heart good to have look'd on her
by this light she had a face methinks worth twenty of you mistress annabella

i am glad she liked you sir
by my troth i thank you forsooth
sure it was the doctor's niece that was last day with us here
'twas she 'twas she

why does he not say so
if i should have said no i should have given him the lie uncle and so have deserv'd a dry beating again i'll none of that

indeed she is if i have any judgment
well sir now you are free you need not care for sending letters now you are dismiss'd your mistress here will none of you

of those i'm regent now
what mean you sweet
to live and die a maid
here's one can say that's but a woman's note
did you but see my heart then would you swear that you were dead
that's true or somewhat near it
see you these true love's tears
they plead to you for grace
oh grant my suit
to let me live take it
that is not mine to give
one such another word would kill his hopes
mistress to leave those fruitless strifes of wit know i have lov'd you long and lov'd you truly not hope of what you have but what you are hath drawn me on then let me not in vain still feel the rigour of your chaste disdain i'm sick and sick to the heart
why i thought you had been sick
do you mock my love
there sir she was too nimble
'tis plain she laughs at me
these scornful taunts neither become your modesty nor years
you are no looking−glass or if you were i would dress my language by you
to put you out of doubt my lord methinks your common sense should make you understand that if i lov'd you or desired your love some way i should have given you better taste but since you are a nobleman and one i would not wish should spend his youth in hopes let me advise you to forbear your suit and think i wish you well i tell you this
is 't you speak this
yes i myself yet know thus far i give you comfort if mine eyes could have pick'd out a man amongst all those that sued to me to make a husband of you should have been that man let this surfice be noble in your secrecy and wise
why now i see she loves me
as ever virtue liv'd within your mind as ever noble courses were your guide as ever you would have me know you lov'd me let not my father know hereof by you if i hereafter find that i must marry it shall be you or none
i take that promise

you know what you have done heaven forgive you
'tis too late to repent now heaven help us
how dost thou know 't
how do i know 't
am i at these years ignorant what the meanings of qualms and water−pangs be
of changing of colours queasiness of stomachs pukings and another thing that i could name
do not for her and your credit's sake spend the time in asking how and which way 'tis so she is quick upon my word if you let a physician see her water you are undone
but in what case is she
prettily amended 'twas but a fit which i soon espied and she must look for often henceforward
commend me to her bid her take no care let not the doctor visit her i charge you make some excuse till i return
i have a world of business in my head
do not discomfort her how do these news perplex me
if my father come to her tell him she's recover'd well say 'twas but some ill diet d' ye hear woman
look you to 't
enter florio and richardetto
and how do you find her sir
indifferent well i see no danger scarce perceive she's sick but that she told me she had lately eaten melons and as she thought those disagreed with her young stomach
did you give her aught
an easy surfeit water nothing else you need not doubt her health i rather think her sickness is a fullness of her blood you understand me
i do you counsel well and once within these few days will so order it she shall be married ere she know the time
yet let not haste sir make unworthy choice that were dishonour
master doctor no i will not do so neither in plain words my lord soranzo is the man i mean
a noble and a virtuous gentleman

good peace be here and love
welcome religious friar you are one that still bring blessing to the place you come to
sir with what speed i could i did my best to draw this holy man from forth his cell to visit my sick sister that with words of ghostly comfort in this time of need he might absolve her whether she live or die
'twas well done giovanni thou herein hast show'd a christian's care a brother's love come father i'll conduct you to her chamber and one thing would entreat you
i have a father's dear impression and wish before i fall into my grave that i might see her married as 'tis fit a word from you grave man will win her more than all our best persuasions
gentle sir all this i'll say that heaven may prosper her
now if the doctor keep his word soranzo twenty to one you miss your bride
i know 'tis an unnoble act and not becomes a soldier's valour but in terms of love where merit cannot sway policy must i am resolv'd if this physician play not on both hands then soranzo falls
you are come as i could wish this very night soranzo 'tis ordain'd must be affied to annabella and for aught i know married
yet your patience the place 'tis friar bonaventure's cell

ay you are wretched miserably wretched almost condemn'd alive
there is a place list daughter
in a black and hollow vault where day is never seen there shines no sun but flaming horror of consuming fires a lightless sulphur chok'd with smoky fogs of an infected darkness in this place dwell many thousand thousand sundry sorts of never−dying deaths there damned souls roar without pity there are gluttons fed with toads and adders there is burning oil pour'd down the drunkard's throat the usurer is forced to sup whole draughts of molten gold there is the murderer for ever stabb'd yet can he never die there lies the wanton on racks of burning steel whilst in his soul he feels the torment of his raging lust
there stand these wretched things who have dream'd out whole years in lawless sheets and secret incests cursing one another then you will wish each kiss your brother gave had been a dagger's point then you shall hear how he will cry oh would my wicked sister had first been damn'd when she did yield to lust
but soft methinks i see repentance work new motions in your heart say how is 't with you
is there no way left to redeem my miseries
there is despair not heaven is merciful and offers grace even now
'tis thus agreed first for your honour's safety that you marry my lord soranzo next to save your soul leave off this life and henceforth live to him

why man i would but wish two hours to send him to his last and lasting sleep and vasques thou shalt see i'll do it bravely
i do not doubt your wisdom nor i trust you my secrecy i am infinitely yours
i will be thine in spite of my disgrace
i durst be sworn he'd laugh to see me weep
and that's a villainous fault in him
no let him laugh i am arm'd in my resolves be thou still true
i should get little by treachery against so hopeful a preferment as i am like to climb to even to my bosom vasques
let my youth revel in these new pleasures if we thrive he now hath but a pair of days to live
enter florio donado richardetto poggio and officers
'tis bootless now to show yourself a child
signior donado what is done is done spend not the time in tears but seek for justice
i must confess somewhat i was in fault that had not first acquainted you what love passed 'twixt him and my niece but as i live his fortune grieves me as it were mine own
alas poor creature he meant no man harm that i am sure of
i believe that too
but stay my masters are you sure you saw the murderer pass here
officer an it please you sir we are sure we saw a ruffian with a naked weapon in his hand all bloody get into my lord cardinal's grace's gate that we are sure of but for fear of his grace bless us
we durst go no farther
know you what manner of man he was
officer yes sure i know the man they say he is a soldier he that lov'd your daughter sir an 't please ye 'twas he for certain

officer ay ay the same
the cardinal is noble he no doubt will give true justice
knock someone at the gate
we require speech with the lord cardinal about some present business pray inform his grace that we are here
enter cardinal followed by grimaldi
cardinal why how now friends
what saucy mates are you that know nor duty nor civility
are we a person fit to be your host or is our house become your common inn to beat our doors at pleasure
what such haste is yours as that it cannot wait fit times
are you the masters of this commonwealth and know no more discretion
oh your news is here before you you have lost a nephew donado last night by grimaldi slain is that your business
well sir we have knowledge on 't let that suffice
in presence of your grace in thought i never meant bergetto harm but florio you can tell with how much scorn soranzo back'd with his confederates hath often wrong'd me i to be reveng'd for that i could not win him else to fight had thought by way of ambush to have kill'd him but was unluckily therein mistook else he had felt what late bergetto did and though my fault to him were merely chance kneeling
yet humbly i submit me to your grace to do with me as you please
cardinal rise up grimaldi
you citizens of parma if you seek for justice know as nuncio from the pope for this offence i here receive grimaldi into his holiness' protection he is no common man but nobly born of princes' blood though you sir florio thought him too mean a husband for your daughter
if more you seek for you must go to rome for he shall thither learn more wit for shame
bury your dead away grimaldi leave 'em
exeunt cardinal and grimaldi
is this a churchman's voice
justice is fled to heaven and comes no nearer
was 't for him
had he the face to speak it and not blush
come come donado there's no help in this when cardinals think murder's not amiss great men may do their wills we must obey but heaven will judge them for 't another day
act enter the friar giovanni annabella philotis soranzo donado florio richardetto putana and vasques these holy rites perform'd now take your times to spend the remnant of the day in feast such fit repasts are pleasing to the saints who are your guests though not with mortal eyes to be beheld
long prosper in this day you happy couple to each other's joy
father your prayer is heard the hand of goodness hath been a shield for me against my death and more to bless me hath enrich'd my life with this most precious jewel such a prize as earth hath not another like to this
cheer up my love and gentlemen my friends rejoice with me in mirth this day we'll crown with lusty cups to annabella's health
were the marriage yet undone ere i'd endure this sight to see my love clipped by another i would dare confusion and stand the horror of ten thousand deaths
are you not well sir
prithee fellow wait i need not thy officious diligence
signior donado come you must forget your late mishaps and drown your cares in wine
reach me that weighty bowl
here brother giovanni here's to you your turn comes next though now a bachelor here's to your sister's happiness and mine
drinks and offers him the bowl
'twill indeed offend me
pray do not urge him if he be not willing
what noise is this
oh sir i had forgot to tell you certain young maidens of parma in honour to madam annabella's marriage have sent their loves to her in a masque for which they humbly crave your patience and silence
we are much bound to them so much the more as it comes unexpected guide them in
enter hippolita followed by ladies in white robes with garlands of willows all masked
music and a dance
now might we but know to whom we have been beholding for this love we shall acknowledge it
yes you shall know unmasks
what think you now
'tis she be not amaz'd nor blush young lovely bride i come not to defraud you of your man 'tis now no time to reckon up the talk what parma long hath rumour'd of us both let rash report run on
the breath that vents it will like a bubble break itself at last
but now to you sweet creature lend your hand perhaps it hath been said that i would claim some interest in soranzo now your lord what i have right to do his soul knows best but in my duty to your noble worth sweet annabella and my care of you here take soranzo take this hand from me i'll once more join what by the holy church is finished and allow'd
have i done well
you have too much engaged us
that you may know my single charity freely i here remit all interest i e'er could claim and give you back your vows and to confirm 't reach me a cup of wine vasques gives her a poisoned cup
my lord soranzo in this draught i drink long rest t' ye
look to it vasques
fear nothing hippolita i thank you and will pledge this happy union as another life
you shall have none neither shall you pledge her
know now mistress she−devil your own mischievous treachery hath kill'd you i must not marry you
omnes what's the matter
foolish woman thou art now like a firebrand that hath kindled others and burnt thyself troppo sperar inganna thy vain hope hath deceived thee thou art but dead if thou hast any grace pray
die in charity for shame
this thing of malice this woman hath privately corrupted me with promise of marriage under this politic reconciliation to poison my lord whilst she might laugh at his confusion on his marriage−day
i promised her fair but i knew what my reward should have been and would willingly have spared her life but that i was acquainted with the danger of her disposition and now have fitted her a just payment in her own coin there she is she hath yet and end thy days in peace vile woman as for life there's no hope think not on 't
heaven thou art righteous
oh 'tis true i feel my minute coming
had that slave kept promise oh my torment
thou this hour hadst died soranzo heat above hell−fire
yet ere i pass away cruel cruel flames
take here my curse amongst you may thy bed of marriage be a rack unto thy heart burn blood and boil in vengeance oh my heart my flame's intolerable may'st thou live to father bastards may her womb bring forth monsters and die together in your sins hated scorn'd and unpitied
was e'er so vile a creature
here's the end of lust and pride
it is a fearful sight
vasques i know thee now a trusty servant and never will forget thee
come my love we'll home and thank the heavens for this escape
father and friends we must break up this mirth it is too sad a feast
bear hence the body
here's an ominous change
mark this my giovanni and take heed
i fear the event that marriage seldom's good where the bride−banquet so begins in blood
enter richardetto and philotis
my wretched wife more wretched in her shame than in her wrongs to me hath paid too soon the forfeit of her modesty and life
and i am sure my niece though vengeance hover keeping aloof yet from soranzo's fall yet he will fall and sink with his own weight
i need not now my heart persuades me so to further his confusion there is one above begins to work for as i hear debates already 'twixt his wife and him thicken and run to head she as 'tis said slightens his love and he abandons hers much talk i hear
since things go thus my niece in tender love and pity of your youth my counsel is that you should free your years from hazard of these woes by flying hence to fair cremona there to vow your soul in holiness a holy votaress leave me to see the end of these extremes
all human worldly courses are uneven no life is blessed but the way to heaven
uncle shall i resolve to be a nun
ay gentle niece and in your hourly prayers remember me your poor unhappy uncle
hie to cremona now as fortune leads your home your cloister your best friends your beads your chaste and single life shall crown your birth who dies a virgin lives a saint on earth
then farewell world and worldly thoughts adieu
welcome chaste vows myself i yield to you
enter soranzo unbraced and dragging in annabella
come strumpet famous whore
were every drop of blood that runs in thy adulterous veins a life this sword dost see't
should in one blow confound them all
harlot rare notable harlot that with thy brazen face maintain'st thy sin was there no man in parma to be bawd to your loose cunning whoredom else but must your hot itch and pleurisy of lust the heyday of your luxury be fed up to a surfeit and could none but i be pick'd out to be cloak to your close tricks your belly−sports
now i must be the dad to all that gallimaufry that is stuff'd in thy corrupted bastard−bearing womb
why must beastly man
i sued not to thee for but that i thought your over−loving lordship would have run mad on denial had you lent me time i would have told you in what case i was but you would needs be doing
darest thou tell me this
oh yes why not
you were deceived in me 'twas not for love i chose you but for honour yet know this would you be patient yet and hide your shame i'd see whether i could love you
why art thou not with child
what needs all this when 'tis superfluous
i confess i am
tell me by whom
soft 'twas not in my bargain
yet somewhat sir to stay your longing stomach i am content t' acquaint you with man the more than man that got this sprightly boy for 'tis a boy and therefore glory sir your heir shall be a son damnable monster
nay an you will not hear i'll speak no more
yes speak and speak thy last
a match a match
this noble creature was in every part so angel−like so glorious that a woman who had not been but human as was i would have kneel'd to him and have begg'd for love
why you are not worthy once to name his name without true worship or indeed unless you kneel'd to hear another name him
what was he call'd
we are not come to that let it suffice that you shall have the glory to father what so brave a father got
in brief had not this chance fall'n out as it doth i never had been troubled with a thought that you had been a creature but for marriage i scarce dream yet of that
tell me his name
alas alas there's all
you shall never know
never if you do let me be curs'd
not know it strumpet
i'll rip up thy heart and find it there
and with my teeth tear the prodigious lecher joint by joint
come whore tell me your lover or by truth i'll hew thy flesh to shreds who is 't
che morte piu dolce che morire per amore
thus will i pull thy hair and thus i'll drag thy lust beleper'd body through the dust hales her up and down
yet tell his name
morendo in grazia dee morire senza dolore
the treasure of the earth shall not redeem thee were there kneeling kings did beg thy life or angels did come down to plead in tears yet should not all prevail against my rage dost thou not tremble yet
no be a gallant hangman i dare thee to the worst strike and strike home i leave revenge behind and thou shalt feel it
yet tell me ere thou diest and tell me truly knows thy old father this
no by my life
wilt thou confess and i will spare thy life
i will not buy my life so dear
i will not slack my vengeance
what do you mean sir
forbear vasques such a damned whore deserves no pity
now the gods forefend
and would you be her executioner and kill her in your rage too
oh 'twere most unmanlike she is your wife what faults have been done by her before she married you were not against you alas
poor lady what hath she committed which any lady in italy in the like case would not
sir you must be ruled by your reason and not by your fury that were inhuman and beastly
she shall not live
come she must you would have her confess the authors of her present misfortunes i warrant you 'tis an unconscionable demand and she should lose the estimation that i for my part hold of her worth if she had done it why sir you ought not of all men living to know it
good sir be reconciled alas good gentlewoman
pish do not beg for me i prize my life as nothing if the man will needs be mad why let him take it
vasques hear'st thou this
yes and commend her for it in this she shows the nobleness of a gallant spirit and beshrew my heart but it becomes her rarely
sir in any case smother your revenge leave the scenting out your wrongs to me be ruled as you respect your honour or you mar all
sir if ever my service were of any credit with you be not so violent in your distractions you are married now what a triumph might the report of this give to other neglected suitors
'tis as manlike to bear extremities as godlike to forgive
oh vasques vasques in this piece of flesh this faithless face of hers had i laid up the treasure of my heart
hadst thou been virtuous fair wicked woman not the matchless joys of life itself had made me wish to live with any saint but thee deceitful creature how hast thou mock'd my hopes and in the shame of thy lewd womb even buried me alive
i did too dearly love thee
this is well follow this temper with some passion be brief and moving 'tis for the purpose
be witness to my words thy soul and thoughts and tell me didst not think that in my heart i did too superstitiously adore thee
i must confess i know you lov'd me well
and wouldst thou use me thus
be thou assured whoe'er the villain was that thus hath tempted thee to this disgrace well he might lust but never loved like me
he doted on the picture that hung out upon thy cheeks to please his humorous eye for on the part i lov'd which was thy heart and as i thought thy virtues
these words wound deeper than your sword could do
let me not ever take comfort but i begin to weep myself so much i pity him why madam i knew when his rage was overpast what it would come to
forgive me annabella though thy youth hath tempted thee above thy strength to folly yet will i not forget what i should be and what i am a husband in that name is hid divinity if i do find that thou wilt yet be true here i remit all former faults and take thee to my bosom
by my troth and that's a point of noble charity
sir on my knees rise up you shall not kneel
get you to your chamber see you make no show of alteration i'll be with you straight my reason tells me now that 'tis as common to err in frailty as to be a woman
go to your chamber
this was somewhat to the matter what do you think of your heaven of happiness now sir
i carry hell about me all my blood is fired in swift revenge
that may be but know you how or on whom
to marry a great woman being made great in the stock to your hand is a usual sport in these days but to know what ferret it was that hunted your coney−burrow there is the cunning
i'll make her tell herself or or what
you must not do so let me yet persuade your sufferance a little while go to her use her mildly win her if it be possible to a voluntary to a weeping tune for the rest if all hit i will not miss my mark
pray sir go in the next news i tell you shall be wonders
delay in vengeance gives a heavier blow
ah sirrah here's work for the nonce
i had a suspicion of a bad matter in my head a pretty while ago but after my madam's scurvy looks here at home her waspish perverseness and loud fault−finding then i remembered the proverb that where hens crow and cocks hold their peace there are sorry houses
'sfoot if the lower parts of a she−tailor's cunning can cover such a swelling in the stomach i'll never blame a false stitch in a shoe whilst i live again
up and up so quick
and so quickly too
'twere a fine policy to learn by whom this must be known and i have thought on 't enter putana in tears
here's the way or none
what crying old mistress
alas alas i cannot blame you we have a lord heaven help us is so mad as the devil himself the more shame for him
oh vasques that ever i was born to see this day
doth he use thee so too sometimes vasques
why he makes a dog of me but if some were of my mind i know what we would do
as sure as i am an honest man he will go near to kill my lady with unkindness say she be with child is that such a matter for a young woman of her years to be blamed for
alas good heart it is against her will full sore
i durst be sworn all his madness is for that she will not confess whose 'tis which he will know and when he doth know it i am so well acquainted with his humour that he will forget all strait well i could wish she would in plain terms tell all for that's the way indeed
do you think so
foh i know it provided that he did not win her to it by force
he was once in a mind that you could tell and meant to have wrung it out of you but i somewhat pacified him from that yet sure you know a great deal
heaven forgive us all
i know a little vasques
why should you not
upon my conscience she loves you dearly and you would not betray her to any affliction for the world
not for all the world by my faith and troth vasques
'twere pity of your life if you should but in this you should both relieve her present discomforts pacify my lord and gain yourself everlasting love and preferment
dost think so vasques
nay i know it sure it was some near and entire friend
'twas a dear friend indeed but but what
fear not to name him my life between you and danger 'faith i think it was no base fellow
thou wilt stand between me and harm
'uds pity what else
you shall be rewarded too trust me
'twas even no worse than her own brother
her brother giovanni i warrant you
even he vasques as brave a gentleman as ever kiss'd fair lady
oh they love most perpetually
a brave gentleman indeed
why therein i commend her choice better and better aloud
you are sure 'twas he
sure and you shall see he will not be long from her too
he were to blame if he would but may i believe thee
why dost think i am a turk or a jew
no vasques i have known their dealings too long to belie them now
how now what are these
you shall know presently
come sirs take me this old damnable hag gag her instantly and put out her eyes quickly quickly
gag her i say 'sfoot do you suffer her to prate
what do you fumble about
let me come to her
i'll help your old gums you toad−bellied bitch
sirs carry her closely into the coal−house and put out her eyes instantly if she roars slit her nose do you hear be speedy and sure
exeunt banditti with putana
why this is excellent and above expectation her own brother
to what a height of liberty in damnation hath the devil trained our age
there's yet but a beginning i must to my lord and tutor him better in his points of vengeance now i see how a smooth tale goes beyond a smooth tail but soft what thing comes next
as i could wish my belief is strengthened 'tis as firm as winter and summer
troubled with a new sickness my lord she's somewhat ill
took too much of the flesh i believe
troth sir and you i think have even hit it but my virtuous lady where is she
in her chamber please you visit her she is alone
giovanni gives him money
your liberality hath doubly made me your servant and ever shall ever exit giovanni re−enter soranzo
sir i am made a man i have plied my cue with cunning and success i beseech you let us be private
my lady's brother's come now he'll know all
let him know it i have made some of them fast enough
how have you dealt with my lady
gently as thou hast counsell'd oh my soul runs circular in sorrow for revenge but vasques thou shalt know nay i will know no more for now comes your turn to know i would not talk so openly with you let my young master take time enough and go at pleasure he is sold to death and the devil shall not ransom him
sir i beseech you your privacy
no conquest can gain glory of my fear
act annabella appears at a window above
pleasures farewell and all ye thriftless minutes wherein false joys have spun a weary life
to these my fortunes now i take my leave
thou precious time that swiftly rid'st in post over the world to finish up the race of my last fate here stay thy restless course and bear to ages that are yet unborn a wretched woeful woman's tragedy
my conscience now stands up against my lust with depositions character'd in guilt enter friar below
and tells me i am lost now i confess beauty that clothes the outside of the face is cursed if it be not cloth'd with grace
here like a turtle mew'd up in a cage unmated i converse with air and walls and descant on my vile unhappiness
that hast had the spoil of thine own virtues and my modest fame would thou hadst been less subject to those stars that luckless reign'd at my nativity
oh would the scourge due to my black offence might pass from thee that i alone might feel the torment of an uncontrolled flame
what's this i hear
that man that blessed friar who join'd in ceremonial knot my hand to him whose wife i now am told me oft i trod the path to death and show'd me how
but they who sleep in lethargies of lust hug their confusion making heaven unjust and so did here's music to the soul
forgive me my good genius and this once be helpful to my ends let some good man pass this way to whose trust i may commit this paper double lined with tears and blood which being granted here i sadly vow repentance and a leaving of that life i long have died in
lady heaven hath heard you and hath by providence ordain'd that i should be his minister for your behoof
ha what are you
your brother's friend the friar glad in my soul that i have liv'd to hear this free confession 'twixt your peace and you what would you or to whom
fear not to speak
is heaven so bountiful
then i have found more favour than i hoped here holy man throws down a letter
commend me to my brother give him that that letter bid him read it and repent
tell him that i imprison'd in my chamber barr'd of all company even of my guardian which gives me cause of much suspect have time to blush at what hath passed bid him be wise and not believe the friendship of my lord i fear much more than i can speak good father the place is dangerous and spies are busy
i must break off
be sure i will and fly with speed my blessing ever rest with thee my daughter live to die more blest
thanks to the heavens who have prolong'd my breath to this good use
now i can welcome death
withdraws from the window
enter soranzo and vasques
am i to be believed now
first marry a strumpet that cast herself away upon you but to laugh at your horns
to feast on your disgrace riot in your vexations cuckold you in your bride−bed waste your estate upon panders and bawds
no more i say no more
a cuckold is a goodly tame beast my lord
i am resolv'd urge not another word my thoughts are great and all as resolute as thunder in meantime i'll cause our lady to deck herself in all her bridal robes kiss her and fold her gently in my arms
begone yet hear you are the banditti ready to wait in ambush
good sir trouble not yourself about other business than your own resolution remember that time lost cannot be recalled
with all the cunning words thou canst invite the states of parma to my birthday's feast haste to my brother−rival and his father entreat them gently bid them not to fail be speedy and return
let not your pity betray you till my coming back think upon incest and cuckoldry
revenge is all the ambition i aspire to that i'll climb or fall my blood's on fire
busy opinion is an idle fool that as a school−rod keeps a child in awe frights th' unexperienced temper of the mind so did it me who ere my precious sister was married thought all taste of love would die in such a contract but i find no change of pleasure in this formal law of sports
she is still one to me and every kiss as sweet and as delicious as the first i reap'd when yet the privilege of youth entitled her a virgin
oh the glory of two united hearts like hers and mine
let poring bookmen dream of other worlds my world and all of happiness is here and i'd not change it for the best to come a life of pleasure is elysium
father you enter on the jubilee of my retired delights now i can tell you the hell you oft have prompted is nought else but slavish and fond superstitious fear and i could prove it too thy blindness slays thee look there 'tis writ to thee
gives him the letter
unrip the seals and see the blood's yet seething hot that will anon be frozen harder than congealed coral
why d' ye change colour son
'fore heaven you make some petty devil factor 'twixt my love and your religion−masked sorceries
where had you this
thy conscience youth is sear'd else thou wouldst stoop to warning
'tis her hand i know 't and 'tis all written in her blood
she writes i know not what
i'll not fear an armed thunderbolt aim'd at my heart
she writes we are discover'd pox on dreams of low faint−hearted cowardice
the devil we are
which way is 't possible
are we grown traitors to our own delights
confusion take such dotage
'tis but forged this is your peevish chattering weak old man
now sir what news bring you
my lord according to his yearly custom keeping this day a feast in honour of his birthday by me invites you thither
your worthy father with the pope's reverend nuncio and other magnificoes of parma have promised their presence will 't please you to be of the number
yes tell him i dare come
so i said and tell him more i will come
these words are strange to me
say i will come
you will not miss
so i'll say my service to you
you will not go i trust
oh do not go this feast i'll gage my life is but a plot to train you to your ruin be ruled you shall not go
stood death threatening his armies of confounding plagues with hosts of dangers hot as blazing stars i would be there not go
yes and resolve to strike as deep in slaughter as they all for i will go
go where thou wilt i see the wildness of thy fate draws to an end to a bad fearful end i must not stay to know thy fall back to bononia i with speed will haste and shun this coming blow
parma farewell would i had never known thee or aught of thine
well young man since no prayer can make thee safe i leave thee to despair
despair or tortures of a thousand hells all's one to me i have set up my rest
now now work serious thoughts on baneful plots be all a man my soul let not the curse of old prescription rend from me the gall of courage which enrolls a glorious death if i must totter like a well−grown oak some under−shrubs shall in my weighty fall be crush'd to splits with me they all shall perish
enter soranzo vasques with masques and banditti
you will not fail or shrink in the attempt
i will undertake for their parts be sure my masters to be bloody enough and as unmerciful as if you were preying upon a rich booty on the very mountains of liguria for your pardons trust to my lord but for reward you shall trust none but your own pockets
we'll make a murder
here's gold gives them money
here's more want nothing what you do is noble and an act of brave revenge i'll make you rich banditti and all free
hold take every man a vizard when you are withdrawn keep as much silence as you can possibly
you know the watchword till which be spoken move not but when you hear that rush in like a stormy flood i need not instruct you in your own profession
omnes no no no
in then your ends are profit and preferment
the guests will all come vasques
and now let me a little edge your resolution you see nothing is unready to this great work but a great mind in you call to your remembrance your disgraces your loss of honour hippolita's blood and arm your courage in your own wrongs so shall you best right those wrongs in vengeance which you may truly call your own
'tis well the less i speak the more i burn and blood shall quench that flame
now you begin to turn italian
this beside when my young incest− monger comes he will be sharp set on his old bit give him time enough let him have your chamber and bed at liberty let my hot hare have law ere he be hunted to his death that if it be possible he post to hell in the very act of his damnation
it shall be so and see as we would wish he comes himself first enter giovanni
welcome my much−lov'd brother now i perceive you honour me you are welcome but where's my father
with the other states attending on the nuncio of the pope to wait upon him hither
like a good housewife scarcely ready yet you were best walk to her chamber
i must expect my honourable friends good brother get her forth
you are busy sir
even as the great devil himself would have it
let him go and glut himself in his own destruction flourish
hark the nuncio is at hand good sir be ready to receive him
enter cardinal florio donado richardetto and attendants
most reverend lord this grace hath made me proud that you vouchsafe my house i ever rest your humble servant for this noble favour
cardinal you are our friend my lord his holiness shall understand how zealously you honour saint peter's vicar in his substitute our special love to you
signiors to you my welcome and my ever best of thanks for this so memorable courtesy
pleaseth your grace walk near
cardinal my lord we come to celebrate your feast with civil mirth as ancient custom teacheth we will go
attend his grace there
signiors keep your way
annabella richly dressed and giovanni
what chang'd so soon
hath your new sprightly lord found out a trick in night−games more than we could know in our simplicity
or does the fit come on you to prove treacherous to your past vows and oaths
why should you jest at my calamity without all sense of the approaching dangers you are in
what dangers half so great as thy revolt
thou art a faithless sister else thou know'st malice or any treachery beside would stoop to my bent brows why i hold fate clasp'd in my fist and could command the course of time's eternal motion hadst thou been one thought more steady than an ebbing sea
you'll now be honest that's resolv'd
brother dear brother know what i have been and know that now there's but a dining−time 'twixt us and our confusion let's not waste these precious hours in vain and useless speech
these gay attires were not put on but to some end this sudden solemn feast was not ordain'd to riot in expense i that have now been chamber'd here alone barr'd of my guardian or of any else am not for nothing at an instant freed to fresh access
be not deceiv'd my brother this banquet is an harbinger of death to you and me resolve yourself it is and be prepared to welcome it
well then the schoolmen teach that all this globe of earth shall be consumed to ashes in a minute
so i have read too
but 'twere somewhat strange to see the waters burn could i believe this might be true i could believe as well there might be hell or heaven
a dream a dream
else in this other world we should know one another
have you heard so
but do you think that i shall see you there
you look on me
may we kiss one another prate or laugh or do as we do here
i know not that but brother for the present what d' ye mean to free yourself from danger
some way think how to escape i'm sure the guests are come
look up look here what see you in my face
distraction and a troubled conscience
death and a swift repining wrath yet look what see you in mine eyes
i do indeed these are the funeral tears shed on your grave these furrow'd up my cheeks when first i lov'd and knew not how to woo
fair annabella should i here repeat the story of my life we might lose time
be record all the spirits of the air and all things else that are that day and night early and late the tribute which my heart hath paid to annabella's sacred love hath been these tears which are her mourners now
never till now did nature do her best to show a matchless beauty to the world which in an instant ere it scarce was seen the jealous destinies required again
since we must part go thou white in thy soul to fill a throne of innocence and sanctity in heaven
pray pray my sister
then i see your drift ye blessed angels guard me
so say i kiss me
if ever aftertimes should hear of our fast−knit affections though perhaps the laws of conscience and of civil use may justly blame us yet when they but know our loves that love will wipe away that rigour which would in other incests be abhorr'd
give me your hand how sweetly life doth run in these well−colour'd veins
how constantly these palms do promise health
but i could chide with nature for this cunning flattery kiss me again forgive me
will you be gone
be dark bright sun and make this midday night that thy gilt rays may not behold a deed will turn their splendour more sooty than the poets feign their styx
one other kiss my sister
to save thy fame and kill thee in a kiss
thus die and die by me and by my hand
revenge is mine honour doth love command
oh brother by your hand
when thou art dead i'll give my reasons for 't for to dispute with thy even in thy death most lovely beauty would make me stagger to perform this act which i most glory in
forgive him heaven and me my sins
farewell brother unkindunkind mercy great heaven oh oh
she's dead alas good soul
the hapless fruit that in her womb received its life from me hath had from me a cradle and a grave
i must not dally this sad marriage−bed in all her best bore her alive and dead
soranzo thou hast miss'd thy aim in this
i have prevented now thy reaching plots and kill'd a love for whose each drop of blood i would have pawn'd my heart
fair annabella how over−glorious art thou in thy wounds triumphing over infamy and hate
shrink not courageous hand stand up my heart and boldly act my last and greater part
enter the cardinal florio donaldo sorarizo richardetto vasquces and attendants
apart to soranza remember sir what you have to do be wise and resolute
enough my heart is fix'd
pleaseth your grace to taste these coarse confections though the use of such set entertainments more consists in custom than in cause yet reverend sir i am still made your servant by your presence
cardinal and we your friend
but where's my brother giovanni
enter giovanni with a heart upon his dagger
trimm'd in reeling blood that triumphs over death
proud in the spoil of love and vengeance
fate or all the powers that guide the motions of immortal souls could not prevent me
cardinal what means this
shall i be forestall'd
be not amazed if your misgiving hearts shrink at an idle sight what bloodless fear of coward passion would have seiz'd your senses had you beheld the rape of life and beauty which i have acted
my sister oh my sister
the glory of my deed darken'd the midday sun made noon as night
you came to feast my lords with dainty fare i came to feast too but i digg'd for food in a much richer mine than gold or stone of any value balanced 'tis a heart a heart my lords in which is mine entomb'd look well upon 't do you know it
what strange riddle's this
'tis annabella's heart 'tis why do you startle
i vow 'tis hers this dagger's point plough'd up her fruitful womb and left to me the fame of a most glorious executioner
why madman art thyself
yes father and that times to come may know how as my fate i honour'd my revenge list father to your ears i will yield up how much i have deserv'd to be your son
what is 't thou say'st
nine moons have had their changes since i first thoroughly view'd and truly lov'd your daughter and my sister
alas my lords he is a frantic madman
for nine months space in secret i enjoy'd sweet annabella's sheets nine months i lived a happy monarch of her heart and her soranzo thou know'st this thy paler cheek bears the confounding print of thy disgrace for her too fruitful womb too soon betray'd the happy passage of our stolen delights and made her mother to a child unborn
oh his rage belies him
it does not 'tis the oracle of truth i vow it is so
i shall burst with fury bring the strumpet forth
do sir have you all no faith to credit yet my triumphs
here i swear by all that you call sacred by the love i bore my annabella whilst she lived these hands have from her bosom ripp'd this heart
is 't true or no sir
'tis most strangely true
cursed man have i lived to dies
cardinal hold up florio
see what thou hast done broke thy old father's heart
is none of you dares venture on him
oh my father how well his death becomes him in his griefs
why this was done with courage now survives none of our house but i gilt in the blood of a fair sister and a hapless father
inhuman scorn of men hast thou a thought outlive thy murders
yes i tell thee yes for in my fists i bear the twists of life
soranzo see this heart which was thy wife's thus i exchange it royally for thine
and thus and thus
now brave revenge is mine
i cannot hold any longer
you sir are you grown insolent in your butcheries
come i am arm'd to meet thee
will it not be yet
if this will not another shall
i shall fit you anon the banditti rush in
come more of you whate'er you be i dare your worst they surround and wound him
oh i can stand no longer feeble arms have you so soon lost strength
now you are welcome sir
away my masters all is done shift for yourselves your reward is your own shift for yourselves
how do you my lord
dead but in death well pleas'd that i have liv'd to see my wrongs reveng'd on that black devil
oh vasques to thy bosom let me give my last of breath let not that lecher live oh
the reward of peace and rest be with you my ever dearest lord and master
whose hand gave me this wound
mine sir i was your first man have you enough
i thank thee thou hast done for me but what i would have else done on myself
art sure thy lord is dead
as sure as i am sure to see thee die
cardinal think on thy life and end and call for mercy
why i have found it in this justice
cardinal strive yet to cry to heaven
oh i bleed fast
death thou 'rt a guest long look'd for i embrace thee and thy wounds oh my last minute comes
where'er i go let me enjoy this grace freely to view my annabella's face
strange miracle of justice
cardinal raise up the city we shall be murder'd all
you need not fear you shall not this strange task being ended i have paid the duty to the son which i have vowed to the father
cardinal speak wretched villain what incarnate fiend hath led thee on to this
honesty and pity of my master's wrongs for know my lord i am by birth a spaniard brought forth my country in my youth by lord soranzo's father whom whilst he lived i served faithfully since whose death i have been to this man as i was to him
what i have done was duty and i repent nothing but that the loss of my life had not ransomed his
cardinal say fellow know'st thou any yet unnam'd of council in this incest
yes an old woman sometime guardian to this murder'd lady
cardinal and what's become of her
within this room she is whose eyes after her confession i caused to be put out but kept alive to confirm what from giovanni's own mouth you have heard
now my lord what i have done you may judge of and let your own wisdom be a judge in your own reason
first this woman chief in these effects my sentence is that forthwith she be ta'en out of the city for example's sake there to be burnt to ashes
cardinal be it your charge donado see it done
if death 'tis welcome i have been honest to the son as i was to the father
cardinal fellow for thee since what thou didst was done not for thyself being no italian we banish thee for ever to depart within three days in this we do dispense with grounds of reason not of thine offence
'tis well this conquest is mine and i rejoice that a spaniard outwent an italian in revenge
cardinal take up these slaughter'd bodies see them buried and all the gold and jewels or whatsoever confiscate by the canons of the church we seize upon to the pope's proper use
your grace's pardon thus long i liv'd disguised to see the effect of pride and lust at once brought both to shameful ends
richardetto whom we thought for dead
sir was it you your friend
cardinal we shall have time to talk at large of all but never yet incest and murder have so strangely met
of one so young so rich in nature's store who could not say 'tis pity she's a whore
