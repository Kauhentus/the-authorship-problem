the first and second acts in milan during part of the third in the imperial camp near pavia the rest of the play in milan and its neighbourhood
an outer room in the castle
enter graccho julio and giovanni with flaggons
take every man his flaggon give the oath to all you meet i am this day the state drunkard i am sure against my will and if you find a man at ten that's sober he's a traitor and in my name arrest him
very good sir but say he be a sexton
if the bells ring out of tune as if the street were burning and he cry 'tis rare music
bid him sleep 'tis a sign he has ta'en his liquor and if you meet an officer preaching of sobriety unless he read it in geneva print lay him by the heels
but think you 'tis a fault to be found sober
it is capital treason or if you mitigate it let such pay forty crowns to the poor but give a pension to all the magistrates you find singing catches or their wives dancing for the courtiers reeling and the duke himself i dare not say distempered but kind and in his tottering chair carousing they do the country service if you meet one that eats bread a child of ignorance and bred up in the darkness of no drinking against his will you may initiate him in the true posture though he die in the taking his drench it skills not what's a private man for the public honour
we've nought else to think on
and so dear friends copartners in my travails drink hard and let the health run through the city until it reel again and with me cry "long live the duchess
" enter tiberio and stephano
here are two lords − what think you
shall we give the oath to them
no i know them you need not swear them your lord by his patent stands bound to take his rouse
long live the duchess
exeunt graccho julio and giovanni
the cause of this
but yesterday the court wore the sad livery of distrust and fear no smile not in a buffoon to be seen or common jester the great duke himself had sorrow in his face
which waited on by his mother sister and his fairest duchess dispersed a silent mourning through all milan as if some great blow had been given the state or were at least expected
stephano i know as you are noble you are honest and capable of secrets of more weight than now i shall deliver
if that sforza the present duke though his whole life hath been but one continued pilgrimage through dangers affrights and horrors which his fortune guided by his strong judgment still hath overcome appears now shaken it deserves no wonder all that his youth hath laboured for the harvest sown by his industry ready to be reaped too being now at stake and all his hopes confirmed or lost for ever
i know no such hazard his guards are strong and sure his coffers full the people well affected and so wisely his provident care hath wrought that though war rages in most parts of our western world there is no enemy near us
dangers that we see to threaten ruin are with ease prevented but those strike deadly that come unexpected the lightning is far off yet soon as seen we may behold the terrible effects that it produceth
but i'll help your knowledge and make his cause of fear familiar to you
the wars so long continuéd between the emperor charles and francis the french king have interessed in either's cause the most of the italian princes among which sforza as one of greatest power was sought by both but with assurance having one his friend the other lived his enemy
'tis true and 'twas a doubtful choice
but he well knowing and hating too it seems the spanish pride lent his assistance to the king of france which hath so far incensed the emperor that all his hopes and honours are embarked with his great patron's fortune
which stands fair for aught i yet can hear
but should it change the duke's undone
they have drawn to the field two royal armies full of fiery youth of equal spirit to dare and power to do so near intrenched that 'tis beyond all hope of human counsel they can e'er be severed until it be determined by the sword who hath the better cause for the success concludes the victor innocent and the vanquished most miserably guilty
how uncertain the fortune of the war is children know and it being in suspense on whose fair tent winged victory will make her glorious stand you cannot blame the duke though he appear perplexed and troubled
but why then in such a time when every knee should bend for the success and safety of his person are these loud triumphs
in my weak opinion they are unseasonable
i judge so too but only in the cause to be excused
it is the duchess’ birthday once a year solemnized with all pomp and ceremony in which the duke is not his own but hers nay every day indeed he is her creature for never man so doted − but to tell the tenth part of his fondness to a stranger would argue me of fiction
she's indeed a lady of most exquisite form
she knows it and how to prize it
i ne'er heard her tainted in any point of honour
on my life she's constant to his bed and well deserves his largest favours
but when beauty is stamped on great women great in birth and fortune and blown by flatterers greater than it is 'tis seldom unaccompanied with pride nor is she that way free presuming on the duke's affection and her own desert she bears herself with such a majesty looking with scorn on all as things beneath her that sforza's mother that would lose no part of what was once her own nor his fair sister a lady too acquainted with her worth will brook it well and howsoe'er their hate is smothered for a time 'tis more than feared it will at length break out
he in whose power it is turn all to the best
come let us to the court we there shall see all bravery and cost that art can boast of
i'll bear you company
i another room in the same
enter francisco isabella and mariana
i will not go i scorn to be a spot in her proud train
shall i that am his mother be so indulgent as to wait on her that owes me duty
'tis done to the duke and not to her and my sweet wife remember and madam if you please receive my counsel as sforza is your son you may command him and as a sister you may challenge from him a brother's love and favour but this granted consider he's the prince and you his subjects and not to question or contend with her whom he is pleased to honour
private men prefer their wives and shall he being a prince and blest with one that is the paradise of sweetness and of beauty to whose charge the stock of women's goodness is given up not use her like herself
you are ever forward to sing her praises
others are as fair i am sure as noble
i detract from none in giving her what's due were she deformed yet being the duchess i stand bound to serve her but as she is to admire her
never wife met with a purer heat her husband's fervour a happy pair one in the other blest
she confident in herself he's wholly hers and cannot seek for change and he secure that 'tis not in the power of man to tempt her
and therefore to contest with her that is the stronger and the better part of him is more than folly you know him of a nature not to be played with and should you forget to obey him as your prince he'll not remember the duty that he owes you
'tis but truth come clear our brows and let us to the banquet but not to serve his idol
i shall do what may become the sister of a prince but will not stoop beneath it
yet be wise soar not too high to fall but stoop to rise
i a state room in the same
enter three gentlemen setting forth a banquet
quick quick for love's sake
let the court put on her choicest outside cost and bravery be only thought of
all that may be had to please the eye the ear taste touch or smell are carefully provided
there's a masque have you heard what's the invention
no matter it is intended for the duchess' honour and if it give her glorious attributes as the most fair most virtuous and the rest twill please the duke
all is in order
enter tiberio stephano francisco sforza marcelia isabella mariana and attendants
you are the mistress of the feast − sit here o my soul's comfort
and when sforza bows thus low to do you honour let none think the meanest service they can pay my love but as a fair addition to those titles they stand possessed of
let me glory in my happiness and mighty kings look pale with envy while i triumph in mine own
o mother look on her
and since this present age yields not a woman worthy to be her second borrow of times past and let imagination help of those canónized ladies sparta boasts of and in her greatness rome was proud to owe to fashion one yet still you must confess the phoenix of perfection ne'er was seen but in my fair marcelia
she's indeed the wonder of all times
your excellence though i confess you give her but her own forces her modesty to the defence of a sweet blush
it need not my marcelia when most i strive to praise thee i appear a poor detractor for thou art indeed so absolute in body and in mind that but to speak the least part to the height would ask an angel's tongue and yet then end in silent admiration
you still court her as if she were a mistress not your wife
she is more to me and every day deserves more to be sued to
such as are cloyed with those they have embraced may think their wooing done no night to me but is a bridal one where hymen lights his torches fresh and new and those delights which are not to be clothed in airy sounds enjoyed beget desires as full of heat and jovial fervour as when first i tasted her virgin fruit
and be it numbered amongst those happy ones in which a blessing was by the full consent of all the stars conferred upon mankind
the only object i behold with pleasure − my pride my glory in a word my all
bear witness heaven that i esteem myself in nothing worthy of the meanest praise you can bestow unless it be in this that in my heart i love and honour you
and but that it would smell of arrogance to speak my strong desire and zeal to serve you i then could say these eyes yet never saw the rising sun but that my vows and prayers were sent to heaven for the prosperity and safety of my lord nor have i ever had other study but how to appear worthy your favour and that my embraces might yield a fruitful harvest of content for all your noble travail in the purchase of her that's still your servant
by these lips which pardon me that i presume to kiss − sfor
o swear forever swear
i ne'er will seek delight but in your pleasure and desire when you are sated with all earthly glories and age and honours make you fit for heaven that one grave may receive us
‘tis believed believed my blest one
how she winds herself into his soul
− let others feed on those gross cates while sforza banquets with immortal viands ta'en in at his eyes
i could live ever thus
− command the eunuch to sing the ditty that i last composed in praise of my marceliá
from pavia my dread lord
speak is all lost
the letter will inform you
how his hand shakes as he receives it
this is some allay to his hot passion
though it bring death i'll read it may it please your excellence to understand that the very hour i wrote this heard a bold defiance delivered by a herald from the emperor which was cheerfully received by the king of france
the battailes being ready to join and the vanguard committed to my charge enforces me to end abruptly
your highness's humble servant
aside ready to join
− by this then i am nothing
or my estate secure
aside to doubt is worse than to have lost and to despair is but to antedate those miseries that must fall on us all my hopes depending upon this battle's fortune
in my soul methinks there should be that imperious power by supernatural not usual means to inform me what i am
− the cause considered why should i fear
the french are bold and strong their numbers full and in their councils wise but then the haughty spaniard is all fire hot in his executions fortunate in his attempts married to victory − ay there it is that shakes me
excellent lady this day was dedicated to your honour one gale of your sweet breath will easily disperse these clouds and but yourself there's none that dare speak to him
i will run the hazard
− pardon me marcelia i am troubled and stand uncertain whether i am master of aught that's worth the owning
i am yours sir and i have heard you swear i being safe there was no loss could move you
this day sir is by your gift made mine
can you revoke a grant made to marcelia
− for whose love nay whose honour gentle sir all deep designs and state affairs deferred be as you purposed merry
out of my sight
throws away the letter
and all thoughts that may strangle mirth forsake me
fall what can fall i dare the worst of fate though the foundation of the earth should shrink the glorious eye of heavèn lose his splendour supported thus i'll stand upon the ruins and seek for new life here
− why are you sad
by heaven he's not my friend that wears one furrow in his face
i was told there was a masque
they wait your highness' pleasure and when you please to have it − sfor
bid them enter come make me happy once again
i am rapt − 'tis not to day to morrow or the next but all my days and years shall be employed to do thee honour
and my life to serve you
go hang him hang him i say i will not interrupt my present pleasures although his message should import my head hang him i say
nay good sir i am pleased to grant a little intermission to you who knows but he brings news we wish to hear to heighten our delights
as wise as fair
that was my lord
with the delivery of this and prayers to guard your excellency from certain dangers he ceased to be a man
all that my fears could fashion to me or my enemies wish is fallen upon me
− silence that harsh music tis now unseasonable a tolling bell as a sad harbinger to tell me that this pampered lump of flesh must feast the worms is fitter for me − i am sick
sick to the death marceliá
remove these signs of mirth they were ominous and but ushered sorrow and ruin
what sudden change is this
all leave the room i'll bear alone the burden of my grief and must admit no partner
i am yet your prince where's your obedience
− stay marcelia i cannot be so greedy of a sorrow in which you must not share
exeunt tiberio stephano francisco isabella mariana and attendants
and cheerfully i will sustain my part
why look you pale
where is that wonted constancy and courage that dared the worst of fortune
where is sforza to whom all dangers that fright common men appeared but panic terrors
why do you eye me with such fixed looks
love counsel duty service may flow from me not danger
it is for thee i fear for thee thy sforza shakes like a coward for myself unmoved i could have heard my troops were cut in pieces my general slain and he on whom my hopes of rule of state of life had their dependence the king of france my greatest friend made prisoner to so proud enemies
then you have just cause to shew you are a man
all this were nothing though i add to it that i am assured for giving aid to this unfortunate king the emperor incensed lays his command on his victorious army fleshed with spoil and bold of conquest to march up against me and seize on my estates suppose that done too the city ta'en the kennels running blood the ransacked temples falling on their saints my mother in my sight tossed on their pikes and sister ravished and myself bound fast in chains to grace their triumph or what else an enemy's insolence could load me with i would be sforza still
but when i think that my marceliá to whom all these are but as atoms to the greatest hill must suffer in my cause and for me suffer
all earthly torments nay even those the damned howl for in hell are gentle strokes compared to what i feel marcelia
good sir have patience i can as well partake your adverse fortune as i thus long have had an ample share in your prosperity
'tis not in the power of fate to alter me for while i am in spite of it i'm yours
but should that will to be so be forced marcelia and i live to see those eyes i prize above my own dart favours though compelled upon another or those sweet lips yielding immortal nectar be gently touched by any but myself think think marcelia what a cursèd thing i were beyond expression
do not feed those jealous thoughts the only blessing that heaven hath bestowed on us more than on beasts is that 'tis in our pleasure when to die
besides were i now in another's power there are so many ways to let out life i would not live for one short minute his i was born only yours and i will die so
angels reward the goodness of this woman
all i can pay is nothing
− why uncalled for
it is of weight sir that makes me thus press upon your privacies
your constant friend the marquis of pescara tired with haste hath business that concerns your life and fortunes and with speed to impart
wait on him hither
and dearest to thy closet
let thy prayers assist my councils
to spare imprecations against myself without you i am nothing
the marquis of pescara
a great soldier and though he served upon the adverse party ever my constant friend
re enter francisco with pescara
yonder he walks full of sad thoughts
blame him not good francisco he hath much cause to grieve would i might end so and not add this − to fear
my dear pescara a miracle in these times
a friend and happy cleaves to a falling fortune
if it were as well in my weak power in act to raise it as 'tis to bear a part of sorrow with you you then should have just cause to say pescara looked not upon your state but on your virtues when he made suit to be writ in the list of those you favoured
− but my haste forbids all compliment thus then sir to the purpose the cause that unattended brought me hither was not to tell you of your loss or danger for fame hath many wings to bring ill tidings and i presume you've heard it but to give you such friendly counsel as perhaps may make your sad disaster less
you are all goodness and i give up myself to be disposed of as in your wisdom you think fit
thus then sir to hope you can hold out against the emperor were flattery in yourself to your undoing therefore the safest course that you can take is to give up yourself to his discretion before you be compelled for rest assured a voluntary yielding may find grace and will admit defence at least excuse but should you linger doubtful till his powers have seized your person and estates perforce you must expect extremes
i understand you and i will put your counsel into act and speedily
i only will take order for some domestical affairs that do concern me nearly and with the next sun ride with you in the mean time my best friend pray take your rest
indeed i have travelled hard and will embrace your counsel
with all care attend my noble friend
− stay you francisco
you see how things stand with me
to my grief and if the loss of my poor life could be a sacrifice to restore them as they were i willingly would lay it down
i think so for i have ever found you true and thankful which makes me love the building i have raised in your advancement and repent no grace i have conferred upon you
and believe me though now i should repeat my favours to you the titles i have given you and the means suitable to your honours that i thought you worthy my sister and my family and in my dukedom made you next myself it is not to upbraid you but to tell you i find you are worthy of them in your love and service to me
sir i am your creature and any shape that you would have me wear i gladly will put on
thus then francisco i now am to deliver to your trust a weighty secret of so strange a nature and 'twill i know appear so monstrous to you that you will tremble in the execution as much as i am tortured to command it for 'tis a deed so horrid that but to hear it would strike into a ruffian fleshed in murders or an obdurate hangman soft compassion and yet francisco of all men the dearest and from me most deserving such my state and strange condition is that thou alone must know the fatal service and perform it
these preparations sir to work a stranger or to one unacquainted with your bounties might appear useful but to me they are needless impertinencies for i dare do whate'er you dare command
but you must swear it and put into the oath all joys or torments that fright the wicked or confirm the good not to conceal it only that is nothing but whensoe'er my will shall speak "strike now
" to fall upon't like thunder
minister the oath in any way or form you please i stand resolved to take it
thou must do then what no malevolent star will dare to look on it is so wicked for which men will curse thee for being the instrument and the blest angels forsake me at my need for being the author for 'tis a deed of night of night francisco
in which the memory of all good actions we can pretend to shall be buried quick or if we be remembered it shall be to fright posterity by our example that have outgone all precedents of villains that were before us and such as succeed though taught in hell's black school shall ne'er come near us
− art thou not shaken yet
i grant you move me but to a man confirmed − sfor
i'll try your temper what think you of my wife
as a thing sacred to whose fair name and memory i pay gladly these signs of duty
is she not the abstract of all that's rare or to be wished in woman
it were a kind of blasphemy to dispute it but to the purpose sir
add too her goodness her tenderness of me her care to please me
her unsuspected chastity ne'er equaled her innocence her honour − o i am lost in the ocean of her virtues and her graces when i think of them
now i find the end of all your conjurations there's some service to be done for this sweet lady
if she have enemies that she would have removed − sfor
francisco her greatest enemy is her greatest lover yet in that hatred her idolater
one smile of hers would make a savage tame one accent of that tongue would calm the seas though all the winds at once strove there for empire
yet i for whom she thinks all this too little should i miscarry in this present journey from whence it is all number to a cipher i ne'er return with honour by thy hand must have her murdered
− she that loves so and so deserves to be beloved again
and i who sometimes you were pleased to favour picked out the instrument
do not fly off what is decreed can never be recalled 'tis more than love to her that marks her out a wished companion to me in both fortunes and strong assurance of thy zealous faith that gives up to thy trust a secret that racks should not have forced from me
there is no heaven without her nor a hell where she resides
i ask from her but justice
and what i would have paid to her had sickness or any other accident divorced her purer soul from her unspotted body
the slavish indian princes when they die are cheerfully attended to the fire by the wife and slave that living they loved best to do them service in another world nor will i be less honoured that love more
and therefore trifle not but in thy looks express a ready purpose to perform what i command or by marcelia's soul this is thy latest minute
'tis not fear of death but love to you makes me embrace it but for mine own security when 'tis done what warrant have if you please to sign one i shall though with unwillingness and horror perform your dreadful charge
i will francisco but still remember that a prince's secrets are balm concealed but poison if discovered
i may come back then this is but a trial to purchase thee if it were possible a nearer place in my affection − but i know thee honest
'tis a character i will not part with
i may live to reward it
an open space before the castle
enter tiberio and stephano
without guard or retinue fitting a prince
no enemy near to force him to leave his own strengths yet deliver up himself as 'twere in bonds to the discretion of him that hates him
you never heard the motives that induced him to this strange course
no those are cabinet councils and not to be communicated but to such as are his own and sure
we fill up empty places and in public are taught to give our suffrages to that which was before determined and are safe so
signior francisco upon whom alone his absolute power is with all strength conferred during his absence can with ease resolve you to me they are riddles
well he shall not be my oedipus i'll rather dwell in darkness
but my good lord tiberio this francisco is on the sudden strangely raised
o sir he took the thriving course he had a sister a fair one too with whom as it is rumoured the duke was too familiar but she cast off what promises soever passed between them upon the sight of this forsook the court and since was never seen
to smother this as honours never fail to purchase silence francisco first was graced and step by step is raised up to this height
but how is his absence borne
sadly it seems by the duchess for since he left the court for the most part she hath kept her private chamber no visitants admitted
in the church she hath been seen to pay her pure devotions seasoned with tears and sure her sorrow's true or deeply counterfeited pomp and state and bravery cast off and she that lately rivalled poppaea in her varied shapes or the egyptian queen now widow like in sable colours as her husband's dangers strangled in her the use of any pleasure mourns for his absence
it becomes her virtue and does confirm what was reported of her
you take it right but on the other side
the darling of his mother mariana as there were an antipathy between her and the duchess' passions and as she'd no dependence on her brother's fortune she ne'er appeared so full of mirth
enter graccho with fiddlers
her favourite and accompanied to your report
you shall scrape and i will sing a scurvy ditty to a scurvy tune repine who dares
but if we should offend the duchess having silenced us and these lords stand by to hear us − grac
they in name are lords but i am one in power and for the duchess but yesterday we were merry for her pleasure we now'll be for my lady's
a poor man sir a servant to the princess but you great lords and counsellors of state whom i stand bound to reverence
come we know you are a man in grace
no i grant i bear my fortunes patiently − serve the princess and have access at all times to her closet such is my impudence
when your grave lordships are masters of the modesty to attend three hours nay sometimes four and then bid wait upon her the next morning
pray you what news is stirring
i've no intelligence at home nor abroad i only sometimes guess the change of the times i should ask of your lordships who are to keep their honours who to lose them who the duchess smiled on last or on whom frowned you only can resolve me we poor waiters deal as you see in mirth and foolish fiddles it is our element and − could you tell me what point of state 'tis that i am commanded to muster up this music on mine honesty you should much befriend me
sirrah you grow saucy
and would be laid by the heels
not by your lordships without a special warrant look to your own stakes were i committed here come those would bail me perhaps we might change places too
enter isabella and mariana graccho whispers the latter
we must be patient
there is no contending
see the informing rogue
that we should stoop to such a mushroom
thou dost mistake they durst not use the least word of scorn although provoked to anything of mine
− go get you home and to your servants friends and flatterers number how many descents you're noble − look to your wives too the smooth chinned courtiers are abroad
no way to be a freeman
exeunt tiberio and stephano
your excellence hath the best gift to dispatch these arras pictures of nobility i ever read of
i can speak sometimes
and cover so your bitter pills with sweetness of princely language to forbid reply they are greedily swallowed
but the purpose daughter that brings us hither
is it to bestow a visit on this woman that because she only would be thought truly to grieve the absence and the dangers of my son proclaims a general sadness
if to vex her may be interpreted to do her honour she shall have many of them
i’ll make use of my short reign my lord now governs all and she shall know that her idolater my brother being not by now to protect her i am her equal
aside of a little thing it is so full of gall
a devil of this size should they run for a wager to be spiteful gets not a horse head of her
on her birthday we were forced to be merry and now she's musty we must be sad on pain of her displeasure we will we will
this is her private chamber where like an hypocrite not a true turtle she seems to mourn her absent mate her servants attending her like mutes but i'll speak to her and in a high key too
− play anything that's light and loud enough but to torment her and we will have rare sport
music and a song
marcelia appears at a window above in black
she frowns as if her looks could fright us
may it please your greatness we heard that your late physic hath not worked and that breeds melancholy as your doctor tells us to purge which we that are born your highness' vassals and are to play the fool to do you service present you with a fit of mirth
what think you of a new antic
'twould shew rare in ladies
being intended for so sweet a creature were she but pleased to grace it
she will be it ne'er so mean she's made of courtesy
the mistress of all hearts
one smile i pray you on your poor servants or a fiddler's fee coming from those fair hands though but a ducat we will enshrine it as a holy relic
'tis wormwood and it works
if i lay by my fears and griefs in which you should be sharers if doting age could let you but remember you have a son − or frontless impudence you are a sister and in making answer to what was most unfit for you to speak or me to hear borrow of my just anger − isab
a set speech on my life
penned by her chaplain
yes it can speak without instruction speak and tell your want of manners that you are rude and saucily rude too
now the game begins
you durst not else on any hire or hope remembering what i am and whose i am put on the desperate boldness to disturb the least of my retirements
for both shall understand though the one presume upon the privilege due to a mother the duke stands now on his own legs and needs no nurse to lead him
a dry one and useless too − but i am merciful and dotage signs your pardon
i defy thee thee and thy pardons proud one
for you puppet − mari
what of me pine tree
little you are i grant and have as little worth but much less wit you durst not else the duke being wholly mine his power and honour mine and the allegiance you owe him as a subject due to me − mari
to me and therefore as a vassal from this hour learn to serve me or you'll feel i must make use of my authority and as a princess punish it
i had rather be a slave unto a moor than know thee for my equal
proud of a white face
let her but remember the issue in her leg
the charge she puts the state to for perfumes
and howsoe'er she seems when she's made up as she's herself she stinks above the ground
o that i could reach you
the little one you scorn so with her nails would tear your painted face and scratch those eyes out
do but come down
were there no other way but leaping on thy neck to break my own rather than be outbraved thus − she retires
aside forty ducats upon the little hen she's of the kind and will not leave the pit
that it were lawful to meet her with a poniard and a pistol
but these weak hands shall shew my spleen − re enter marcelia below
where are you you modicum you dwarf
enter francisco tiberio stephano and guards
a tumult in the court
let her come on
what wind hath raised this tempest
sever them i command you
i am out of breath but we shall meet we shall − and do you hear sir
or right me on this monster she's three feet too high for a woman or ne'er look to have a quiet hour with me
if my son were here and would endure this may a mother's curse pursue and overtake him
o forbear in me he's present both in power and will − to marcelia and madam i much grieve that in his absence there should arise the least distaste to move you it being his principal nay only charge to have you in his absence served and honoured as when himself performed the willing office
this is fine i' faith
i would i were well off
and therefore i beseech you madam frown not till most unwittingly he hath deserved it on your poor servant to your excellence i ever was and will be such and lay the duke's authority trusted to me with willingness at your feet
we are like to have an equal judge
but should i find that you are touched in any point of honour or that the least neglect is fall'n upon you i then stand up a prince
without reward pray you dismiss us
would i were five leagues hence
i will be partial to none not to myself be you but pleased to shew me my offence or if you hold me in your good opinion name those that have offended you
i am one and i will justify it
thou art a base fellow to take her part
remember she's the duchess
but used with more contempt than if i were a peasant's daughter baited and hooted at like to a common strumpet with loud noises forced from my prayers and my private chamber which with all willingness i would make my prison during the absence of my lord denied me but if he e'er return − fran
to mariana were you an actor in this lewd comedy
ay marry was i and will be one again
i'll join with her though you repine at it
think not then i speak for i stand bound to honour and to serve you but that the duke that lives in this great lady for the contempt of him in her commands you to be close prisoners
bear them hence this is your charge my lord tiberio and stephano this is yours
i am not cruel but pleased they may have liberty
pleased with a mischief
i'll rather live in any loathsome dungeon than in a paradise at her entreaty and for you upstart − steph
there is no contending
what shall become of these
see them well whipped as you will answer it
now signior graccho what think you of your greatness
i preach patience and must endure my fortune
i was never yet at such a hunt's up nor was so rewarded
exeunt all but francisco and marcelia
let them first know themselves and how you are to be served and honoured which when they confess you may again receive them to your favour and then it will shew nobly
with my thanks the duke shall pay you his if he return to bless us with his presence
there is nothing that can be added to your fair acceptance that is the prize indeed all else are blanks and of no value
as in virtuous actions the undertaker finds a full reward although conferred upon unthankful men so any service done to so much sweetness however dangerous and subject to an ill construction in your favour finds a wished and glorious end
from you i take this as loyal duty but in any other it would appear gross flattery
you are so rare and excellent in all things and raised so high upon a rock of goodness as that vice cannot reach you who but looks on this temple built by nature to perfection but must bow to it and out of that zeal not only learn to adore it but to love it
aside whither will this fellow
pardon therefore madam if an excess in me of humble duty teach me to hope and though it be not in the power of man to merit such a blessing my piety for it is more than love may find reward
you have it in my thanks and on my hand i am pleased that you shall take a full possession of it but take heed that you fix here and feed no hope beyond it if you do it will prove fatal
be it death and death with torments tyrants ne'er found out yet i must say i love you
as a subject and 'twill become you
− and since you are not pleased to understand me but by a plain and usual form of speech all superstitious reverence laid by i love you as a man and as a man i would enjoy you
why do you start and fly me
i am no monster and you but a woman a woman made to yield and by example told it is lawful favours of this nature are in our age no miracles in the greatest and therefore lady − marcel
− o you powers
and add to that unthankful
a crime which creatures wanting reason fly from
are all the princely bounties favours honours which with some prejudice to his own wisdom thy lord and raiser hath conferred upon thee in three days' absence buried
hath i made thee a thing obscure almost without a name the envy of great fortunes
have i graced thee beyond thy rank and entertain thee as a friend and not a servant
and is this this impudent attempt to taint my honour the fair return of both our ventured favours
the devil may plead mercy and with as much assurance as thou yield one
burns lust so hot in thee
or is thy pride grown up to such a height that but a princess no woman can content thee and add to it his wife and princess to whom thou art tied in all the bonds of duty
– read my life and find one act of mine so loosely carried that could invite a most self loving fool set off with all that fortune could throw on him to the least hope to find way to my favour and what's the worst mine enemies wish me i'll be thy strumpet
‘tis acknowledged madam that your whole course of life hath been a pattern for chaste and virtuous women
in your beauty which i first saw and loved as a fair crystal i read your heavenly mind clear and untainted and while the duke did prize you to your value could it have been in man to pay that duty i well might envy him but durst not hope to stop you in your full career of goodness but now i find that he's fall'n from his fortune and howsoever he would appear doting grown cold in his affection i presume from his most barbarous neglect of you to offer my true service
nor stand i bound to look back on the courtesies of him that of all living men is most unthankful
you'll say i am modest when i have told the story
can he tax me that have received some worldly trifles from him for being ungrateful when he that first tasted and hath so long enjoyed your sweet embraces in which all blessings that our frail condition is capable of are wholly comprehended as cloyed with happiness contemns the give of his felicity and as he reached not the masterpiece of mischief which he aims at unless he pay those favours he stands bound to with fell and deadly hate
− you think he loves you with unexampled fervour nay dotes on you as there were something in you more than woman when on my knowledge he long since hath wished you were among the dead − and i you scorn so perhaps am your preserver
bless me good angels or i am blasted
lies so false and wicked and fashioned to so damnable a purpose cannot be spoken by a human tongue
my husband hate me
give thyself the lie false and accursed
thy soul if thou hast any can witness never lady stood so bound to the unfeigned affection of her lord as i do to my sforza
if thou wouldst work upon my weak credulity tell me rather that the earth moves the sun and stars stand still the ocean keeps nor floods nor ebbs or that there's peace between the lion and the lamb or that the ravenous eagle and the dove keep in one aerie and bring up their young or anything that is averse to nature and i will sooner credit it than that my lord can think of me but as a jewel he loves more than himself and all the world
it were a sin for which we have no name to keep you longer in this wilful error
read his affection here gives her a paper
and then observe how dear he holds you
'tis his character which cunning yet could never counterfeit
'tis his hand i'm resolved of it
i'll try what the inscription is
pray you do so
reads you know my pleasure and the hour of marcelia’s death which fail not to execute as you will answer the contrary not with your head alone but with the ruin of your whole family
and this written with mine own hand and signed with my privy signet shall be your sufficient warrant
i do obey it
every word's a poniard and reaches to my heart
what have i done
for heaven's sake madam
− o my fate
i'll bend her body this is yet some pleasure i'll kiss her into a new life
for the duke's sake for sforza's sake − marcel
stand off though dead i will be his and even my ashes shall abhor the touch of any other
− o unkind and cruel
learn women learn to trust in one another there is no faith in man sforza is false false to marceliá
but i am true and live to make you happy
all the pomp state and observance you had being his compared to what you shall enjoy when mine shall be no more remembered
lose his memory and look with cheerful beams on your new creature and know what he hath plotted for your good fate cannot alter
if the emperór take not his life at his return he dies and by my hand my wife that is his heir shall quickly follow − then we reign alone
for with this arm i'll swim through seas of blood or make a bridge arched with the bones of men but i will grasp my aims in you my dearest dearest and best of women
thou art a villain
all attributes of arch villains made into one cannot express thee
i prefer the hate of sforza though it mark me for the grave before thy base affection
i am yet pure and unspotted in my true love to him nor shall it be corrupted though he's tainted nor will i part with innocence because he is found guilty
for thyself thou art a thing that equal with the devil himself i do detest and scorn
thou then art nothing thy life is in my power disdainful woman
think on't and tremble
no though thou wert now to play thy hangman's part
− thou well may'st be my executioner and art only fit for such employment but ne'er hope to have the least grace from me
i will never see thee but as the shame of men so with my curses of horror to thy conscience in this life and pains in hell hereafter i spit at thee and making haste to make my peace with heaven expect thee as my hangman
i am lost in the discovery of this fatal secret
cursed hope that flattered me that wrongs could make her a stranger to her goodness
all my plots turn back upon myself but i am in and must go on and since i have put off from the shore of innocence guilt be now my pilot
revenge first wrought me murder's his twin brother one deadly sin then help to cure another

the spoil the spoil
'tis that the soldier fights for
our victory as yet affords us nothing but wounds and empty honour
we have passed the hazard of a dreadful day and forced a passage with our swords through all the dangers that page like wait on the success of war and now expect reward
hell put it in the enemy's mind to be desperate and hold out
yieldings and compositions will undo us and what is that way given for the most part comes to the emperor's coffers to defray the charge of the great action as 'tis rumoured when usually some thing in grace that ne'er heard the cannon's roaring tongue but at a triumph puts in and for his intercession shares all that we fought for the poor soldier left to starve or fill up hospitals
but when we enter towns by force and carve ourselves pleasure with pillage
and the richest wines open our shrunk up veins and pour into them new blood and fervour − med
i long to be at it to see these chuffs that every day may spend a soldier's entertainment for a year yet make a third meal of a bunch of raisins these sponges that suck up a kingdom's fat battening like scarabs in the dung of peace to be squeezed out by the rough hand of war and all that their whole lives have heaped together by cozenage perjury or sordid thrift with one gripe to be ravished
i would be tousing their fair madonnas that in little dogs monkeys and paraquittos consume thousands yet for the advancement of a noble action repine to part with a poor piece of eight war's plagues upon them
i have seen them stop their scornful noses first then seem to swoon at sight of a buff jerkin if it were not perfumed and hid with gold yet these nice wantons spurred on by lust covered in some disguise to meet some rough court stallion and be leaped durst enter into any common brothel though all varieties of stink contend there yet praise the entertainment
i may live to see the tattered'st rascals of my troop drag them out of their closets with a vengeance
when neither threatening flattering kneeling howling can ransom one poor jewel or redeem themselves from their blunt wooing
my main hope is to begin the sport at milan there's enough and of all kinds of pleasure we can wish for to satisfy the most covetous
every day we look for a remove
for lodowick sforza the duke of milan i on mine own knowledge can say thus much he is too much a soldier too confident of his own worth too rich too and understands too well the emperor hates him to hope for composition
on my life we need not fear his coming in
on mine i do not wish it i had rather that to shew his valour he'd put us to the trouble to fetch him in by the ears
enter charles pescara and attendants
you make me wonder nay it is no counsel you may partake it gentlemen who'd have thought that he that scorned our proffered amity when he was sued to should ere he be summoned whether persuaded to it by base fear or flattered by false hope which 'tis uncertain first kneel for mercy
when your majesty shall please to instruct us who it is we may admire it with you
who but the duke of milan the right hand of the french
of all that stand in our displeasure whom necessity compels to seek our favour i would have sworn sforza had been the last
and should be writ so in the list of those you pardon
would his city had rather held us out a siege like troy than by a feigned submission he should cheat you of a just revenge or us of those fair glories we have sweat blood to purchase
with your honour you cannot hear him
the sack alone of milan will pay the army
i am not so weak to be wrought on as you fear
nor ignorant that money is the sinew of the war and on what terms soever he seek peace 'tis in our power to grant it or deny it yet for our glory and to shew him that we've brought him on his knees it is resolved to hear him as a suppliant
bring him in but let him see the effects of our just anger in the guard that you make for him
aside to medina i am now familiar with the issue all plagues on it
he will appear in some dejected habit his countenance suitable and for his order a rope about his neck then kneel and tell old stories what a worthy thing it is to have the power and not to use it then add to that a tale of king tigranes and great pompey who said forsooth and wisely
'twas more honour to make a king than kill one which applied to the emperor and himself a pardon's granted to him an enemy and we his servants condemned to beggary
yonder he comes but not as you expected
re enter pescara with sforza strongly guarded
aside to medina he looks as if he would outface his dangers
i am cozened a suitor in the devil's name
i come not emperor to invade thy mercy by fawning on thy fortune nor bring with me excuses or denials
i profess and with a good man's confidence even this instant that i am in thy power i was thine enemy thy deadly and vowed enemy one that wished confusion to thy person and estates and with my utmost powers and deepest counsels had they been truly followed furthered it
nor will i now although my neck were under the hangman's axe with one poor syllable confess but that i honoured the french king more than myself and all men
by saint jacques this is no flattery
there is fire and spirit in't but not long lived i hope sfor
now give me leave my hate against thyself and love to him freely acknowledged to give up the reasons that make me so affected in my wants i ever found him faithful had supplies of men and monies from him and my hopes quite sunk were by his grace buoyed up again he was indeed to me as my good angel to guard me from all dangers
i dare speak nay must and will his praise now in as high and loud a key as when he was thy equal
− the benefits he sowed in me met not unthankful ground but yielded him his own with fair increase and i still glory in it
and though my fortunes poor compared to his and milan weighed with france appear as nothing are in thy fury burnt let it be mentioned they served but as small tapers to attend the solemn flame at this great funeral and with them i will gladly waste myself rather than undergo the imputation of being base or unthankful
i do begin i know not why to hate him less than i did
if that then to be grateful for courtesies received or not to leave a friend in his necessities be a crime amongst you spaniárds which other nations that like you aimed at empire loved and cherished where'er they found it sforza brings his head to pay the forfeit
nor come i as a slave pinioned and fettered in a squalid weed falling before thy feet kneeling and howling for a forestalled remission that were poor and would but shame thy victory for conquest over base foes is a captivity and not a triumph
i ne'er feared to die more than i wished to live
when i had reached my ends in being a duke i wore these robes this crown upon my head and to my side this sword was girt and witness truth that now 'tis in another's power when i shall part with them and life together i'm the same my veins then did not swell with pride nor now shrink they for fear
know sir that sforza stands prepared for either fortune
as i live i do begin strangely to love this fellow and could part with three quarters of my share in the promised spoil to save him
but if example of my fidelity to the french whose honours titles and glories are now mixed with yours as brooks devoured by rivers lose their names has power to invite you to make him a friend that hath given evident proof he knows to love and to be thankful this my crown now yours you may restore me and in me instruct these brave commanders should your fortune change which now i wish not what they may expect from noble enemies for being faithful the charges of the war i will defray and what you may not without hazard force bring freely to you i'll prevent the cries of murdered infants and of ravished maids which in a city sacked call on heaven's justice and stop the course of glorious victories and when i know the captains and the soldiers that have in the late battle done best service and are to be rewarded i myself according to their quality and merits will see them largely recompensed
− i have said and now expect my sentence
by this light − ‘tis a brave gentleman
how like a block the emperor sits
he hath delivered reasons especially in his purpose to enrich such as fought bravely i myself am one i care not who knows it as i wonder that he can be so stupid
now he begins to stir mercy an't be thy will
thou hast so far outgone my expectation noble sforza − for such i hold thee − and true constancy raised on a brave foundation bears such palm and privilege with it that where we behold it though in an enemy it does command us to love and honour it
by my future hopes i am glad for thy sake that in seeking favour thou did'st not borrow of vice her indirect crooked and abject means and for mine own that since my purposes must now be changed touching thy life and fortunes the world cannot tax me of levity in my settled counsels i being neither wrought by tempting bribes nor servile flattery but forced into it by a fair war of virtue
all former passages of hate be buried for thus with open arms i meet thy love and as a friend embrace it and so far i am from robbing thee of the least honour that with my hands to make it sit the faster i set thy crown once more upon thy head and do not only style thee duke of milan but vow to keep thee so
yet not to take from others to give only to myself i will not hinder your magnificence to my commanders neither will i urge it but in that as in all things else i leave you to be your own disposer
to seal my loyalty though with loss of life in some brave service worthy caesar's favour i shall die most happy
gentlemen receive me to your loves and if henceforth there can arise a difference between us it shall be in a noble emulation who hath the fairest sword or dare go farthest to fight for charles the emperor
we embrace you as one well read in all the points of honour and there we are your scholars
true but such as far outstrip the master
we'll contend in love hereafter in the meantime pray you let me discharge my debt and as an earnest of what's to come divide this cabinet in the small body of it there are jewels will yield a hundred thousand pistolets which honour me to receive
you bind us to you
and when great charles commands me to his presence if you will please to excuse my abrupt departure designs that most concern me next this mercy calling me home i shall hereafter meet you and gratify the favour
in this and all things we are your servants

so sir this tempest is well overblown and all things fall out to our wishes but in my opinión this quick return before you've made a party in the court among the great ones for these needy captains have little power in peace may beget danger at least suspicion
where true honour lives doubt hath no being i desire no pawn beyond an emperor's word for my assurance
besides pescara to thyself of all men i will confess my weakness − though my state and crown's restored me though i am in grace and that a little stay might be a step to greater honours i must hence
alas i live not here my wife my wife pescara being absent i am dead

enter an officer with graccho
what i did i had warrant for you have tasted my office gently and for those soft strokes flea bitings to the jerks i could have lent you there does belong a feeing
must i pay for being tormented and dishonoured
no your honour’s not impaired in't
what's the letting out of a little corrupt blood and the next way too
there is no surgeon like me to take off a courtier's itch that's rampant at great ladies or turns knave for preferment or grows proud of his rich cloaks and suits though got by brokage and so forgets his betters
very good sir but am i the first man of quality that e'er came under your fingers
not by a thousand and they have said i have a lucky hand too both men and women of all sorts have bowed under this sceptre
i have had a fellow that could indite forsooth and make fine metres to tinkle in the ears of ignorant madams that for defaming of great men was sent me threadbare and lousy and in three days after discharged by another that set him on
i have seen him cap à pié gallant and his stripes washed off with oil of angels
'twas a sovereign cure
there was a sectary too that would not be conformable to the orders of the church nor yield to any argument of reason but still rail at authority brought to me when i had wormed his tongue and trussed his haunches grew a fine pulpit man and was beneficed had he not cause to thank me
there was physic was to the purpose
now for women sir for your more consolation i could tell you twenty fine stories but i'll end in one and 'tis the last that's memorable
prithee do for i grow weary of thee
there was lately a fine she waiter in the court that doted extremely of a gentleman that had his main dependence on a signior's favour i will not name but could not compass him on any terms
this wanton at dead midnight was found at the exercise behind the arras with the 'foresaid signior he got clear off but she was seized on and to save his honour endured the lash and though i made her often curvet and caper she would never tell who played at pushpin with her
why this sir she delivered had store of crowns assigned her by her patron who forced the gentleman to save her credit to marry her and say he was the party found in lob's pound so she that before gladly would have been his whore reigns o'er him as his wife nor dares he grumble at it
speak but truth then is not my office lucky
go there's for thee but what will be my fortune
if you thrive not after that soft correction come again
i thank you knave
and then knave i will fit you

as he came from a close fight at sea under the hatches with a she dunkirk that was shot before between wind and water and he had sprung a leak too or i am cozened
let's be merry with him
how they stare at me
am i turned to an owl
− the wonder gentlemen
i read this morning strange stories of the passive fortitude of men in former ages which i thought impossible and not to be believed but now i look on you my wonder ceases
why sir you have been whipt whipt signior graccho and the whip i take it is to a gentleman the greatest trial that may be of his patience
sir i'll call you to a strict account for this
i'll not deal with you unless i have a beadle for my second and then i'll answer you

say i am rid abroad to take the air but by no means let her know i'm in court
so i shall tell her
my good lord your pleasure
prithee let me beg thy favour for access to the duchess
in good sooth my lord i dare not she's very private
come there's gold to buy thee a new gown and a rich one
i once swore if e'er i lost my maidenhead it should be with a great lord as you are and i know not how i feel a yielding inclination in me if you have appetite
pox on thy maidenhead
where is thy lady
if you venture on her she's walking in the gallery perhaps you will find her less tractable
bring me to her
i fear you'll have cold entertainment when you are at your journey's end and 'twere discretion to take a snatch by the way
prithee leave fooling my page waits in the lobby give him sweetmeats he is trained up for his master's ease and he will cool thee

that with an iron pen is writ in brass on my tough heart now grown a harder metal

enter marcelia and francisco
believe thy tears or oaths
can it be hoped after a practice so abhorred and horrid repentance e'er can find thee
dearest lady great in your fortune greater in your goodness make a superlative of excellence in being greatest in your saving mercy
i do confess humbly confess my fault to be beyond all pity my attempt so barbarously rude that it would turn a saint like patience into savage fury
but you that are all innocence and virtue no spleen or anger in you of a woman but when a holy zeal to piety fires you may if you please impute the fault to love or call it beastly lust for 'tis no better a sin a monstrous sin
yet with it many that did prove good men after have been tempted and though i'm crooked now 'tis in your power to make me straight again
aside is't possible this can be cunning
but if no submission nor prayers can appease you that you may know ‘tis not the fear of death that makes me sue thus but a loathed detestation of my madness which makes me wish to live to have your pardon
i will not wait the sentence of the duke since his return is doubtful but i myself will do a fearful justice on myself no witness by but you there being no more when i offended
yet before i do it for i perceive in you no signs of mercy i will disclose a secret which dying with me may prove your ruin
speak it it will take from the burthen of thy conscience
thus then madam the warrant by my lord signed for your death was but conditional but you must swear by your unspotted truth not to reveal it or i end here abruptly
by my hopes of joys hereafter
nor was it hate that forced him to it but excess of love
and if i ne'er return so said great sforza no living man deserving to enjoy my best marcelia with the first news that i am dead for no man after me must e'er enjoy her fail not to kill her but till certain proof assure thee i am lost" these were his words observe and honour her as if the soul of woman’s goodness only dwelt in hers
this trust i have abused and basely wronged and if the excelling pity of your mind cannot forgive it as i dare not hope it rather than look on my offended lord i stand resolved to punish it
'tis forgiven and by me freely pardoned
in thy fair life hereafter study to deserve this bounty which thy true penitence such i believe it against my resolution hath forced from me
− but that my lord my sforza should esteem my life fit only as a page to wait on the various course of his uncertain fortunes or cherish in himself that sensual hope in death to know me as a wife afflicts me nor does his envy less deserve mine anger which though such is my love i would not nourish will slack the ardour that i had to see him return in safety
but if your entertainment should give the least ground to his jealousy to raise up an opinion i am false you then destroy your mercy
therefore madam though i shall ever look on you as on my life's preserver and the miracle of human pity would you but vouchsafe in company to do me those fair graces and favours which your innocence and honour may safely warrant it would to the duke i being to your best self alone known guilty make me appear most innocent
have your wishes and something i may do to try his temper at least to make him know a constant wife is not so slaved to her husband's doting humours but that she may deserve to live a widow her fate appointing it
aside it is enough nay all i could desire and will make way to my revenge which shall disperse itself on him on her and all

how coldly she receives it
enter sforza pescara isabella mariana graccho and attendants
what you have told me graccho is believed and i'll find time to stir in't
as you see cause i will not do ill offices
i have stood silent thus long marcelia expecting when with more than a greedy haste thou wouldst have flown into my arms and on my lips have printed a deep welcome
my desires to glass myself in these fair eyes have borne me with more than human speed nor durst i stay in any temple or to any saint to pay my vows and thanks for my return till i had seen thee
sir i am most happy to look upon you safe and would express my love and duty in a modest fashion such as might suit with the behaviour of one that knows herself a wife and how to temper her desires not like a wanton fired with hot appetite nor can it wrong me to love discreetly
why can there be a mean in your affectións to sforza
or any act though ne'er so loose that may invite or heighten appetite appear immodest or uncomely
do not move me my passións to you are in extremes and know no bounds − come kiss me
by all the joys of love she does salute me as if i were her grandfather
what witch with cursèd spells hath quenched the amorous heat that lived upon these lips
tell me marcelia and truly tell me is't a fault of mine that hath begot this coldness
or neglect of others in my absence
neither sir i stand indebted to your substitute noble and good francisco for his care and fair observance of me there was nothing with which you being present could supply me that i dare say i wanted
the pleasures that sacred hymen warrants us excepted of which in troth you are too great a doter and there is more of beast in it than man
let us love temperately things violent last not and too much dotage rather argues folly than true affectión
observe but this and how she praised my lord's care and observance and then judge madam if my intelligence have any ground of truth
no more i mark it
how the duke stands
as he were rooted there and had no motión
my lord from whence grows this amazement
it is more dear my friend for i am doubtful whether i've a being but certain that my life's a burden to me
take me back good pescara shew me to caesar in all his rage and fury i disclaim his mercy to live now which is his gift is worse than death and with all studied torments
marcelia is unkind nay worse grown cold in her affection my excess of fervour which yet was never equalled grown distasteful
− but have thy wishes woman thou shalt know that i can be myself and thus shake off the fetters of fond dotage
from my sight without reply for i am apt to do something i may repent
who would place his happiness in most accursèd woman in whom obsequiousness engenders pride and harshness deadly hatred
from this hour i'll labour to forget there are such creatures true friends be now my mistresses
clear your brows and though my heart strings crack for't i will be to all a free example of delight
we will have sports of all kinds and propound rewards to such as can produce us new unsatisfied though we surfeit in their store − and never think of cursed marcelia more
a room in the castle
enter francisco and graccho
and is it possible thou shouldst forget a wrong of such a nature and then study my safety and content
sir but allow me only to have read the elements of courtship not the abstruse and hidden arts to thrive there and you may please to grant me so much knowledge that injuries from one in grace like you are noble favours
is it not grown common in every sect for those that want to suffer from such as have to give
your captain cast if poor though not thought daring but approved so to raise a coward into name that's rich suffers disgraces publicly but receives rewards for them in private
put on we'll be familiar and discourse a little of this argument
that day in which it was first rumoured then confirmed great sforza thought me worthy of his favour i found myself to be another thing not what i was before
i passèd then for a pretty fellow and of pretty parts too and was perhaps received so but once raised the liberal courtiers made me master of those virtues which i ne'er knew in myself if i pretended to a jest 'twas made one by their interpretation if i offered to reason of philosophy though absurdly they had helps to save me and without a blush would swear that i by nature had more knowledge than others could acquire by any labour nay all i did indeed which in another was not remarkable in me shewed rarely
but then they tasted of your bounty
true they gave me those good parts i was not born to and by my intercession they got that which had i crossed them they durst not have hoped for
all this is oracle and shall i then for a foolish whipping leave to honour him that holds the wheel of fortune
no that savours too much of the ancient freedom
since great men receive disgraces and give thanks poor knaves must have nor spleen nor anger
though i love my limbs as well as any man if you had now a humour to kick me lame into an office where i might sit in state and undo others stood i not bound to kiss the foot that did it
though it seem strange there have been such things seen in the memory of man
but to the purpose and then that service done make thine own fortunes
my wife thou say'st is jealous i am too familiar with the duchess
and incensed for her commitment in her brother's absence and by her mother's anger is spurred on to make discovery of it
this her purpose was trusted to my charge which i declined as much as in me lay but finding her determinately bent to undertake it though breaking my faith to her may destroy my credit with your lordship i yet thought though at my peril i stood bound to reveal it
i thank thy care and will deserve this secret in making thee acquainted with a greater and of more moment
come into my bosom and take it from me canst thou think dull graccho my power and honours were conferred upon me and add to them this form to have my pleasures confined and limited
i delight in change and sweet variety that's my heaven on earth for which i love life only
i confess my wife pleased me a day the duchess two and yet i must not say i have enjoyed her but now i care for neither therefore graccho so far i am from stopping mariana in making her complaint that i desire thee to urge her to it
that may prove your ruin the duke already being as 'tis reported doubtful she hath played false
there thou art cozened his dotage like an ague keeps his course and now 'tis strongly on him
but i lose time and therefore know whether thou wilt or no thou art to be my instrument and in spite of the old saw that says "it is not safe on any terms to trust a man that's wronged" i dare thee to be false
this is a language my lord i understand not
you thought sirrah to put a trick on me for the relation of what i knew before and having won some weighty secret from me in revenge to play the traitor
know thou wretched thing by my command thou wert whipt and every day i'll have thee freshly tortured if thou miss in the least charge that i impose upon thee
though what i speak for the most part is true nay grant thou hadst a thousand witnesses to be deposed they heard it 'tis in me with one word such is sforza's confidence of my fidelity not to be shaken to make all void and ruin my accusers
therefore look to't bring my wife hotly on to accuse me to the duke − i have an end in't or think what 'tis makes man most miserable and that shall fall upon thee
thou wert a fool to hope by being acquainted with my courses to curb and awe me or that i should live thy slave as thou didst saucily divine for prying in my counsels still live mine
i am caught on both sides
this 'tis for a puisne in policy's protean school to try conclusions with one that hath commenced and gone out doctor
if i discover what but now he bragged of i shall not be believed if i fall off from him his threats and actions go together and there's no hope of safety
till i get a plummet that may sound his deepest counsels i must obey and serve him want of skill now makes me play the rogue against my will

command me from his sight and with such scorn as he would rate his slave
'twas in his fury
and he repents it madam
was i born to observe his humours
or because he dotes must i run mad
if that your excellence would please but to receive a feeling knowledge of what he suffers and how deep the least unkindness wounds from you you would excuse his hasty language
he hath paid the forfeit of his offence i'm sure with such a sorrow as if it had been greater would deserve a full remission
why perhaps he hath it and i stand more afflicted for his absence than he can be for mine − so pray you tell him
but till i have digested some sad thoughts and reconciled passions that are at war within myself i purpose to be private − and have you care unless it be francisco that no man be admitted
he that at every stage keeps livery mistresses the stallion of the state
they are things above us and so no way concern us
if i were the duke i freely must confess my weakness i should wear yellow breeches
nay spare your labour lady we know our duty and quit the room
is this her privacy
though with the hazard of a check perhaps this may go to the duke
exeunt tiberio and stephano
your face is full of fears and doubts the reason
o best madam they are not counterfeit
i your poor convert that only wish to live in sad repentance to mourn my desperáte attempt of you that have no ends nor aims but that your goodness might be a witness of my penitence which seen would teach you how to love your mercy am robbed of that last hope
the duke the duke i more than fear hath found that i am guilty
by my unspotted honour not from me nor have i with him changed one syllable since his return but what you heard
yet malice is eagle eyed and would see that which is not and jealousy's too apt to build upon unsure foundations
who dares but only think i can be tainted
but for him though almost on certain proof to give it hearing not belief deserves my hate for ever
whether grounded on your noble yet chaste favours shewn unto me or her imprisonment for her contempt to you by my command my frantic wife hath put it in his head
have i then lived so long now to be doubted
are my favours the themes of her discourse
or what i do that never trod in a suspected path subject to base construction
be undaunted for now as of a creature that is mine i rise up your protectress all the grace i hitherto have done you was bestowed with a shut hand it shall be now more free open and liberal
but let it not though counterfeited to the life teach you to nourish saucy hopes
may i be blasted when i prove such a monster
i will stand then between you and all danger
he shall know suspicion overturns what confidence builds and he that dares but doubt when there's no ground is neither to himself nor others sound
so let it work
her goodness that denied my service branded with the name of lust shall now destroy itself and she shall find when he's a suitor that brings cunning armed with power to be his advocates the denial is a disease as killing as the plague and chastity a clue that leads to death
hold but thy nature duke and be but rash and violent enough and then at leisure repent i care not
and let my plots produce this longed for birth in my revenge i have my heaven on earth
another room in the same
enter sforza pescara and three gentlemen
you promised to be merry
there are pleasures and of all kinds to entertain the time
your excellence vouchsafing to make choice of that which best affects you
learn manners too you are rude
aside i have my answer before i ask the question
i must borrow the privilege of a friend and will or else i am like these a servant or what's worse a parasite to the sorrow sforza worships in spite of reason
pray you use your freedom and so far if you please allow me mine to hear you only not to be compelled to take your moral potions
i am a man and though philosophy your mistress rage for't now i have cause to grieve i must be sad and i dare shew it
would it were bestowed upon a worthier subject
you rub a sore whose pain will make me mad and i shall then forget myself and you
lance it no further
have you stood the shock of thousand enemies and outfaced the anger of a great emperor that vowed your ruin though by a desperáte a glorious way that had no precedent
are you returned with honour loved by your subjects
does your fortune court you or rather say your courage does command it
have you given proof to this hour of your life prosperity that searches the best temper could never puff you up nor adverse fate deject your valour
shall i say these virtues so many and so various trials of your constant mind be buried in the frown to please you i will say so of a fair woman
− yet i have seen her equals
good pescara this language in another were profane in you it is unmannerly
i tell you as a friend and tell you plainly to all men else my sword should make reply her goodness does disdain comparison and but herself admits no parallel
but you will say she's cross 'tis fit she should be when i am foolish for she's wise pescara and knows how far she may dispose her bounties her honour safe or if she were averse twas a prevention of a greater sin ready to fall upon me for she's not ignorant but truly understands how much i love her and that her rare parts do deserve all honour
her excellence increasing with her years too i might have fallen into idolatry and from the admiration of her worth been taught to think there is no power above her and yet i do believe had angels sexes the most would be such women and assume no other shape when they were to appear in their full glory
well sir i'll not cross you nor labour to diminish your esteem hereafter of her
since your happiness as you will have it has alone dependence upon her favour from my soul i wish you a fair atonement
time and my submission may work her to it
enter tiberio and stephano
you are well returned say am i blest
hath she vouchsafed to hear you
is there hope left that she may be appeased
let her propound and gladly i'll subscribe to her conditions
she sir yet is froward and desires respite and some privacy
she was harsh at first but ere we parted seemed not implacable
there's comfort yet i'll ply her each hour with new ambassadors of more honours titles and eminence my second self francisco shall solicit her
that a wise man and what is more a prince that may command should sue thus poorly and treat with his wife as she were a victorious enemy at whose proud feet himself his state and country basely begged mercy
what is that you mutter
i'll have thy thoughts
you are too fond and feed a pride that's swollen too big already and surfeits with observance
my vassal speak thus
let my head answer it if i offend
she that you think a saint i fear may play the devil
aside well said old fellow
and he that hath so long engrossed your favours though to be named with reverence lord francisco who as you purpose shall solicit for you i think's too near her
sforza lays his hand on his sword
it may be they confer of joining lordships i'm sure he's private with her
let me go i scorn to touch him he deserves my pity and not my anger
and to be one is thy protection else thou durst not think that love to my marcelia hath left room in my full heart for any jealous thought − that idle passion dwell with thick skinned tradesmen the undeserving lord or the unable
lock up thy own wife fool that must take physic from her young doctor physic upon her back because thou hast the palsy in that part that makes her active
i could smile to think what wretched things they are that dare be jealous were i matched to another messaline while i found merit in myself to please her i should believe her chaste and would not seek to find out my own torment but alas
enjoying one that but to me 's a dian i am too secure
this is a confidence beyond example
enter graccho isabella and mariana
there he is − now speak or be forever silent
if you come to bring me comfort say that you have made my peace with my marcelia
i had rather wait on you to your funeral
you are my mother or by her life you were dead else
would you were to your dishonour
and since dotage makes you wilfully blind borrow of me my eyes or some part of my spirit
are you all flesh
a lump of patience only
no fire in you
but do your pleasure − here your mother was committed by your servant for i scorn to call him husband and myself your sister if that you dare remember such a name mewed up to make the way open and free for the adultress i am unwilling to say a part of sforza
take her head off
she hath blasphemed and by our law must die
for calling of a whore a whore
o hell what do i suffer
or is it treason for me that am a subject to endeavour to save the honour of the duke and that he should not be a wittol on record
for by posterity 'twill be believed as certainly as now it can be proved francisco the great minion that sways all to meet the chaste embraces of the duchess hath leaped into her bed
some proof vile creature
or thou hast spoke thy last
the public fame their hourly private meetings and e'en now when under a pretence of grief or anger you are denied the joys due to a husband and made a stranger to her at all times the door stands open to him to a dutchman this were enough but to a right italian a hundred thousand witnesses
would you have us to be her bawds
o the malice and envy of base women that with horror knowing their own defects and inward guilt dare lie and swear and damn for what's most false to cast aspersions upon one untainted
ye are in your natures devils and your ends − knowing your reputation sunk for ever and not to be recovered − to have all wear your black livery
you have raised a monumental trophy to her pureness in truth your studied purpose to deprave her and all the shot made by your foul detraction falling upon her sure armed innocence returns upon yourselves and if my love could suffer an addition i’m so far from giving credit to you this would teach me more to admire and serve her
you are not worthy to fall as sacrifices to appease her and therefore live till your own envy burst you
all is in vain he is not to be moved
she has bewitched him
‘tis so past belief to me it shews a fable
enter francisco speaking to a servant within
on thy life provide my horses and without the port with care attend me
within i shall my lord
what gimcrack have we next
francisco though all the joys in women are fled from me in thee i do embrace the full delight that i can hope from man
i would impart please you to lend your ear a weighty secret i am in labour to deliver to you
all leave the room
exeunt isabella mariana and graccho
excuse me good pescara ere long i will wait on you
you speak sir the language i should use
be within call perhaps we may have use of you
exeunt tiberio and stephano
say on my comfort
no your torment for so my fate appoints me
i could curse the hour that gave me being
what new monsters of misery stand ready to devour me
let them at once dispatch me
draw your sword then and as you wish your own peace quickly kill me consider not but do it
or if to take my life be too much mercy as death indeed concludes all human sorrows cut off my nose and ears pull out an eye the other only left to lend me light to see my own deformities
why was i born without some mulct imposed on me by nature
would from my youth a loathsome leprosy had run upon this face or that my breath had been infectious and so made me shunned of all societies
cursed be he that taught me discourse or manners or lent any grace that makes the owner pleasing in the eye of wanton women
since those parts which others value as blessings are to me afflictions such my condition is
i am on the rack dissolve this doubtful riddle
that i alone of all mankind that stand most bound to love you and study your content should be appointed not by my will but forced by cruèl fate to be your greatest enemy
− not to hold you in this amazement longer in a word your duchess loves me
is mad for me pursues me hourly
and from hence grew her late neglect of you
i laboured to divert her by persuasion then urged your much love to her and the danger denied her and with scorn
but when i saw her smile then heard her say your love and extreme dotage as a cloak should cover our embraces and your power fright others from suspicion and all favours that should preserve her in her innocence by lust inverted to be used as bawds i could not but in duty though i know that the relation kills in you all hope of peace hereafter and in me 'twill shew both base and poor to rise up her accuser freely discover it
eternal plagues pursue and overtake her
for her sake to all posterity may he prove a cuckold and like to me a thing so miserable as words may not express him that gives trust to all deceiving women
or since it is the will of heavèn to preserve mankind that we must know and couple with these serpents no wise man ever taught by my example hereafter use his wife with more respect than he would do his horse that does him service base woman being in her creation made a slave to man
but like a village nurse stand i now cursing and considering when the tamest fool would do − within there
stephano tiberio and the rest
will be sudden and she shall know and feel love in extremes abused knows no degree in hate
enter tiberio and stephano
go to the chamber of that wicked woman − steph
what wicked woman sir
the devil my wife
force a rude entry and if she refuse to follow you drag her hither by the hair and know no pity any gentle usage to her will call on cruèlty from me to such as shew it
− stand you staring
go and put my will in act
but 'tis a tempest on the sudden raised who durst have dreamed of
exeunt tiberio and stephano
nay since she dares damnation i'll be a fury to her
yet great sir exceed not in your fury she's yet guilty only in her intent
it does include all fact and i might sooner be won to pardon treason to my crown or one that killed my father
you are wise and know what's best to do − yet if you please to prove her temper to the height say only that i am dead and then observe how far she'll be transported
i'll remove a little but be within your call
– aside now to the upshot
howe'er i'll shift for one
re enter tiberio stephano and guard with marcelia
where is this monster this walking tree of jealousy this dreamer this horned beast that would be
are you here sir
is it by your commandment or allowance i am thus basely used
which of my virtues my labours services and cares to please you − for to a man suspicious and unthankful without a blush i may be mine own trumpet − invites this barbarous course
dare you look on me without a seal of shame
impudence how ugly thou appear'st now
thy intent to be a whore leaves thee not blood enough to make the honest blush what had the act done
returned thee the dishonour thou deserv'st though willingly i had given up myself to every common letcher
your chief minion your chosen favourite your wooed francisco has dearly paid for't for wretch
know he's dead and by my hand
the bloodier villain thou but 'tis not to be wondered at thy love does know no other object − thou hast killed then a man i do profess i loved a man for whom a thousand queens might well be rivals
but he i speak it to thy teeth that dares be a jealous fool dares be a murderer and knows no end in mischief
i begin now in this my justice
i have fooled myself into my grave and only grieve for that which when you know you've slain an innocent you needs must suffer
let one call in francisco exit stephano
for he lives vile creature to justify thy falsehood and how often with whorish flatteries thou hast tempted him i being only fit to live a stale a bawd and property to your wantonness
signior francisco sir but evèn now took horse without the ports
we are both abused and both by him undone
− stay death a little till i have cleared me to my lord and then i willingly obey thee
− o my sforza
francisco was not tempted but the tempter and as he thought to win me shewed the warrant that you signed for my death
then i believe thee believe thee innocent too
but being contemned upon his knees with tears he did beseech me not to reveal it i soft hearted fool judging his penitence true was won unto it indeed the unkindness to be sentenced by you before that i was guilty in a thought made me put on a seeming anger towards you and now − behold the issue
as i do may heaven forgive you
her sweet soul has left her beauteous prison
look to the duke he stands as if he wanted motion
grief hath stopped the organ of his speech
take up this body and call for his physicians
o my heart strings
a room in eugenia's house
enter francisco and eugenia in male attire
why could'st thou think eugenia that rewards graces or favours though strewed thick upon me could ever bribe me to forget mine honour
or that i tamely would sit down before i had dried these eyes still wet with showers of tears by the fire of my revenge
look up my dearest
for that proud fair that thief like stepped between thy promised hopes and robbed thee of a fortune almost in thy possessión hath found with horrid proof his love she thought her glory and an assurance of all happiness but hastened her sad ruin
do not flatter a grief that is beneath it for however the credulous duke to me proved false and cruel it is impossible he could be wrought to look on her but with the eyes of dotage and so to serve her
such indeed i grant the stream of his affection was and ran a constant course till i with cunning malice − and yet i wrong my act for it was justice − made it turn backwards and hate in extremes love banished from his heart to fill the room in a word know the fair marcelia's dead
and by sforza 's hand
does it not move you
how coldly you receive it
i expected the mere relation of so great a blessing borne proudly on the wings of sweet revenge would have called on a sacrifice of thanks and joy not to be bounded or concealed
you entertain it with a look as if you wished it were undone
indeed i do for if my sorrows could receive addition her sad fate would increase not lessen them
she never injured me but entertained a fortune humbly offered to her hand which a wise lady gladly would have kneeled for
unless you would impute it as a crime she was more fair than i and had discretion not to deliver up her virgin fort though strait besieged with flatteries vows and tears until the church had made it safe and lawful
and had i been the mistress of her judgment and constant temper skilful in the knowledge of man's malicious falsehood i had never upon his hell deep oaths to marry me given up my fair name and my maiden honour to his foul lust nor lived now being branded in the forehead for his whore the scorn and shame of all good women
have you then no gall anger or spleen familiar to your sex
or is it possible that you could see another to possess what was your due and not grow pale with envy
yes of him that did deceive me
there's no passion that a maid so injured ever could partake of but i have dearly suffered
these three years in my desire and labour of revenge trusted to you i have endured the throes of teeming women and will hazard all fate can inflict on me but i will reach thy heart false sforza
− you have trifled with me and not proceeded with that fiery zeal i looked for from a brother of your spirit
sorrow forsake me and all signs of grief farewell for ever
vengeance armed with fury possess me wholly now
the reason sister of this strange metamorphosis
ask thy fears thy base unmanly fears thy poor delays thy dull forgetfulness equal with death my wrong else and the scandal which can never be washed off from our house but in his blood would have stirred up a coward to a deed in which though he had fallen the brave intent had crowned itself with a fair monument of noble resolution
in this shape i hope to get access and then with shame hearing my sudden execution judge what honour thou hast lost in being transcended by a weak woman
still mine own and dearer
and yet in this you but pour oil on fire and offer your assistance where it needs not and that you may perceive i lay not fallow but had your wrongs stamped deeply on my heart by the iron pen of vengeance i attempted by whoring her to cuckold him that failing i did begin his tragedy in her death to which it served as prologue and will make a memorable story of your fortunes in my assured revenge only best sister let us not lose ourselves in the performance by your rash undertaking we will be as sudden as you could wish
upon those terms i yield myself and cause to be disposed of as you think fit
there's one graccho that followed you it seems upon the track since you left milan that's importunate to have access and will not be denied his haste he says concerns you
bring him to me
though he hath laid an ambush for my life or apprehension yet i will prevent him and work mine own ends out
aside now for my whipping
and if i now outstrip him not and catch him and by a new and strange way too hereafter i'll swear there are worms in my brains
now my good graccho
we meet as 'twere by miracle
love and duty and vigilance in me for my lord's safety first taught me to imagine you were here and then to follow you
all's come forth my lord that you could wish concealed
the duchess' wound in the duke's rage put home yet gave her leave to acquaint him with your practices which your flight did easily confirm
this i expected but sure you come provided of good counsel to help in my extremes
i would not hurt you
such another word's thy death why dar'st thou think it can fall in thy will to outlive what i determine
aside how he awes me
be brief what brought thee hither
care to inform you you are a condemned man pursued and sought for and your head rated at ten thousand ducats to him that brings it
all passages are intercepted and choice troops of horse scour o'er the neighbour plains your picture sent to every state confederate with milan that though i grieve to speak it in my judgment so thick your dangers meet and run upon you it is impossible you should escape their curious search
why let us then turn romans and falling by our own hands mock their threats and dreadful preparations
'twould show nobly but that the honour of our full revenge were lost in the rash action
no eugenia graccho is wise my friend too not my servant and i dare trust him with my latest secret
we would and thou must help us to perform it first kill the duke − then fall what can upon us
for injuries are writ in brass kind graccho and not to be forgotten
aside he instructs me what i should do
i labour with a strong desire to assist you with my service and now i am delivered of 't
speak my oraculous graccho
i have heard sir of men in debt that layed for by their creditors in all such places where it could be thought they would take shelter chose for sanctuary their lodgings underneath their creditors' noses or near that prison to which they were designed if apprehended confident that there they never should be sought for
tis a strange one
but what infer you from it
this my lord that since all ways of your escape are stopped in milan only or what's more in the court whither it is presumed you dare not come concealed in some disguise you may live safe
and not to be discovered
i know thee honest graccho and i will put thy counsel into act and suddenly
yet not to be ungrateful for all thy loving travail to preserve me what bloody end soe'er my stars appoint thou shalt be safe good graccho
− who's within there
in the devil's name what means he
take my friend into your custody and bind him fast i would not part with him
dispatch 'tis for your good to keep you honest graccho
i would not have ten thousand ducats tempt you being of a soft and wax like disposition to play the traitor nor a foolish itch to be revenged for your late excellent whipping give you the opportunity to offer my head for satisfaction
i can look through and through thee thy intents appear to me as written in thy forehead in plain and easy characters and but that i scorn a slave's base blood should rust that sword that from a prince expects a scarlet dye thou now wert dead but live only to pray for good success to crown my undertakings and then at my return perhaps i'll free thee to make me further sport
i will not hear a syllable
exeunt servants with graccho
we must trust ourselves eugenia and though we make use of the counsel of our servants that oil spent like snuffs that do offend we tread them out
− but now to our last scene which we'll so carry that few shall understand how 'twas begun till all with half an eye may see 'tis done
a room in the castle
enter pescara tiberio and stephano
the like was never read of
in my judgment to all that shall but hear it 'twill appear a most impossible fable
for francisco my wonder is the less because there are too many precedents of unthankful men raised up to greatness which have after studied the ruin of their makers
but that melancholy though ending in distraction should work so far upon a man as to compel him to court a thing that has nor sense nor being is unto me a miracle
'troth i'll tell you and briefly as i can by what degrees he fell into this madness
when by the care of his physicians he was brought to life as he had only passed a fearful dream and had not acted what i grieve to think on he called for fair marcelia and being told that she was dead he broke forth in extremes i would not say blasphemed and cried that heaven for all the offences that mankind could do would never be so cruèl as to rob it of so much sweetness and of so much goodness that not alone was sacred in herself but did preserve all others innocent that had but converse with her
then it came into his fancy that she was accused by his mother and his sister thrice he cursed them and thrice his desperate hand was on his sword to have killed them both but he restrained and they shunning his fury spite of all prevention he would have turned his rage upon himself when wisely his physicians looking on the duchess' wound to stay his ready hand cried out it was not mortal
'twas well thought on
he easily believing what he wished more than a perpetuity of pleasure in any object else flattered by hope forgetting his own greatness he fell prostrate at the doctors' feet implored their aid and swore provided they recovered her he would live a private man and they should share his dukedom
they seemed to promise fair and every hour vary their judgments as they find his fit to suffer intermission or extremes for his behaviour since − sfor
within as you have pity support her gently
now be your own witnesses i am prevented
enter sforza isabella mariana doctors and servants with the body of marcelia
carefully i beseech you the gentlest touch torments her and then think what i shall suffer
o you earthly gods you second natures that from your great master who joined the limbs of torn hippolitus and drew upon himself the thunderer's envy are taught those hidden secrets that restore to life death wounded men
you have a patient on whom to express the excellence of art will bind even heaven your debtor though it pleases to make your hands the organs of a work the saints will smile to look on and good angels clap their celestial wings to give it plaudits
how pale and wan she looks
o pardon me that i presume dyed o'er with bloody guilt which makes me i confess far far unworthy to touch this snow white hand
how cold it is
this once was cupid's fire brand and still 'tis so to me
how slow her pulses beat too
yet in this temper she is all perfection and mistress of a heat so full of sweetness the blood of virgins in their pride of youth are balls of snow or ice compared unto her
is not this strange
cross him not dear daughter our conscience tells us we have been abused wrought to accuse the innocent and with him are guilty of a fact − enter a servant and whispers pescara
'tis now past help
he has a strange aspect a jew by birth and a physicián by his profession as he says who hearing of the duke's frenzy on the forfeit of his life will undertake to render him perfect in every part − provided that your lordship's favour gain him free access and your power with the duke a safe protection till the great work be ended
bring me to him as i find cause i'll do
exeunt pescara and servant
how sound she sleeps
heaven keep her from a lethargy
− how long but answer me with comfort i beseech you does your sure judgment tell you that these lids that cover richer jewels than themselves like envious night will bar these glorious suns from shining on me
we have given her sir a sleepy potion that will hold her long that she may be less sensible of the torment the searching of her wound will put her to
she now feels little but if we should wake her to hear her speak would fright both us and you and therefore dare not hasten it
you see i do not rage but wait your pleasure
what do you think she dreams of now
for sure although her body's organs are bound fast her fancy cannot slumber
that sir looks on your sorrow for your late rash act with pity of what you suffer for it and prepares to meet the free confession of your guilt with a glad pardon
she was ever kind and her displeasure though called on short lived upon the least submission
− o you powers that can convey our thoughts to one another without the aid of eyes or ears assist me
let her behold me in a pleasing dream kneels
thus on my knees before her yet that duty in me is not sufficient let her see me compel my mother from whom i took life and this my sister partner of my being to bow thus low unto her let her hear us in my acknowledgment freely confess that we in a degree as high are guilty as she is innocent
− bite your tongues vile creatures and let your inward horror fright your souls for having belied that pureness to come near which all women that posterity can bring forth must be though striving to be good poor rivals
and for that dog francisco that seduced me in wounding her to raise a temple built to chastity and sweetness let her know i'll follow him to hell but i will find him and there live a fourth fury to torment him
then for this cursèd hand and arm that guided the wicked steel i'll have them joint by joint with burning irons seared off which i will eat i being a vulture fit to taste such carrion lastly − doct
you are too loud sir you disturb her sweet repose
yet give us leave thus prostrate at her feet our eyes bent downwards unworthy and ashamed to look upon her to expect her gracious sentence
the body too will putrify and then we can no longer cover the imposture
which in his death will quickly be discovered
i can but weep his fortune
yet be careful you lose no minute to preserve him time may lessen his distraction
re enter pescara with francisco as a jew doctor and eugenia disguised as before
i am no god sir to give a new life to her yet i'll hazard my head i'll work the senseless trunk to appear to him as it had got a second being or that the soul that's fled from't were called back to govern it again
i will preserve it in the first sweetness and by a strange vapour which i'll infuse into her mouth create a seeming breath i'll make her veins run high too as if they had true motion
do but this till we use means to win upon his passions to endure to hear she's dead with some small patience and make thy own reward
the art i use admits no looker on i only ask the fourth part of an hour to perfect that i boldly undertake
i will procure it
sooth me in all i say there's a main end in it
look up sir cheerfully comfort in me flows strongly to you
from whence came that sound
was it from my marcelia
if it were rises
i rise and joy will give me wings to meet it
nor shall your expectation be deferred but a few minutes
your physicians are mere voice and no performance i have found a man that can do wonders
do not hinder the duchess' wished recovery to enquire or what he is or to give thanks but leave him to work this miracle
sure 'tis my good angel
i do obey in all things be it death for any to disturb him or come near till he be pleased to call us
o be prosperous and make a duke thy bondman
exeunt all but francisco and eugenia
'tis my purpose if that to fall a long wished sacrifice to my revenge can be a benefit
i'll first make fast the doors − so
you amaze me what follows now
a full conclusion of all thy wishes
look on this eugenia even such a thing the proudest fair on earth for whose delight the elements are ransacked and art with nature studied to preserve her must be when she is summoned to appear in the court of death
but i lose time
− your ladyship looks pale but i your doctor have a ceruse for you
− see my eugenia how many faces that are adorned in court borrow these helps paints the cheeks
and pass for excellence when the better part of them are like to this
− your mouth smells sour too but here is that shall take away the scent a precious antidote old ladies use when they would kiss knowing their gums are rotten
these hands too that disdained to take a touch from any lip whose owner writ not lord are now but as the coarsest earth but i am at the charge my bill not to be paid too to give them seeming beauty
how do you like my workmanship
i tremble and thus to tyrannize upon the dead is most inhuman
come we for revenge and can we think on pity
now to the upshot and as it proves applaud it
− my lord the duke
enter with joy and see the sudden change your servant's hand hath wrought
re enter sforza and the rest
i live again in my full confidence that marcelia may pronounce my pardon
can she speak yet
no you must not look for all your joys at once that will ask longer time
by all the dues of love i have had from her this hand seems as it was when first i kissed it
these lips invite too i could ever feed upon these roses they still keep their colour and native sweetness only the nectar's wanting that like the morning dew in flowery may preserved them in their beauty
call up the guard
then we are lost
i am got off sir jew a bribe hath done it for all your serious charge there's no disguise can keep you from my knowledge
i am out of breath but this is − fran
spare thy labour fool − francisco
give me all attributes of all you can imagine yet i glory to be the thing i was born
i francisco francisco that was raised by you and made the minion of the time the same francisco that would have whored this trunk when it had life and after breathed a jealousy upon thee as killing as those damps that belch out plagues when the foundation of the earth is shaken i made thee do a deed heaven will not pardon which was − to kill an innocent
call forth the tortures for all that flesh can feel
i dare the worst
only to yield some reason to the world why i pursued this course look on this face made old by thy base falsehood 'tis eugenia
does it start you sir
my sister seduced and fooled by thee but thou must pay the forfeit of thy falsehood
does it not work yet
− whate'er becomes of me which i esteem not art marked for the grave i’ve given thee poison in this cup now observe me which thy lust carousing deeply of made thee forget thy vowed faith to eugenia
how do you sir
like one that learns to know in death what punishment waits on the breach of faith
now i feel an ætna in my entrails
− i have lived a prince and my last breath shall be command
− i burn i burn
yet ere life be consumed let me pronounce upon this wretch all torture that witty cruelty can invent
in all things we will serve you
now i have kept my word torments i scorn i leave the world with glory
they are men and leave behind them name and memory that wronged do right themselves before they die
exeunt guard with francisco
yet i will not die raging for alas
my whole life was a frenzy
− good eugenia in death forgive me
− as you love me bear her to some religious house there let her spend the remnant of her life when i am ashes perhaps she'll be appeased and spare a prayer for my poor soul
bury me with marcelia and let our epitaph be − dies
his speech is stopped
it is in vain to labour to call him back
we'll give him funeral and then determine of the state affairs and learn from this example there's no trust in a foundation that is built on lust
