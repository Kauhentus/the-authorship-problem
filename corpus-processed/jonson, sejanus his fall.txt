i state room in the palace
enter sabinus and silius followed by latiaris
you’re rarely met in court
’tis true indeed this place is not our sphere
no silius we are no good inginers
we want their fine arts and their thriving use should make us graced or favour’d of the times we have no shift of faces no cleft tongues no soft and glutinous bodies that can stick like snails on painted walls or on our breasts creep up to fall from that proud height to which we did by slavery not by service climb
we are no guilty men and then no great we have no place in court office in state that we can say we owe unto our crimes we burn with no black secrets which can make us dear to the pale authors or live fear’d of their still waking jealousies to raise ourselves a fortune by subverting theirs
we stand not in the lines that do advance to that so courted point
enter satrius and natta at a distance
but yonder lean a pair that do
satrius secundus and pinnarius natta the great sejanus’ clients there be two know more than honest counsels whose close breasts were they ripp’d up to light it would be found a poor and idle sin to which their trunks had not been made fit organs
these can lie flatter and swear forswear deprave inform smile and betray make guilty men then beg the forfeit lives to get their livings cut men’s throats with whisperings sell to gaping suitors the empty smoke that flies about the palace laugh when their patron laughs sweat when he sweats be hot and cold with him change every mood habit and garb as often as he varies observe him as his watch observes his clock and true as turquoise in the dear lord’s ring look well or ill with him ready to praise his lordship if he spit or but p fair have an indifferent stool or break wind well nothing can ’scape their catch
these things deserve no note conferr’d with other vile and filthier flatteries that corrupt the times when not alone our gentries chief are fain to make their safety from such sordid acts but all our consuls and no little part of such as have been prætors yea the most of senators that else not use their voices start up in public senate and there strive who shall propound most abject things and base
so much as oft tiberius hath been heard leaving the court to cry o race of men prepared for servitude
which shew’d that he
who least the public liberty could like as lothly brook’d their flat servility
well all is worthy of us were it more who with our riots pride and civil hate have so provok’d the justice of the gods we that within these fourscore years were born free equal lords of the triumphed world and knew no masters but affections to which betraying first our liberties we since became the slaves to one man’s lusts and now to many every minist’ring spy that will accuse and swear is lord of you of me of all our fortunes and our lives
our looks are call’d to question and our words how innocent soever are made crimes we shall not shortly dare to tell our dreams or think but ’twill be treason
tyrants’ arts are to give flatterers grace accusers power that those may seem to kill whom they devour
enter cordus and arruntius
now good cremutius cordus
salutes sabinus hail to your lordship
who’s that salutes your cousin
’tis one cordus a gentleman of rome one that has writ annals of late they say and very well
i think of pompey’s and caius cæsar’s and so down to these
how stands he affected to the present state
is he or drusian or germanic or ours or neutral
i know him not so far
those times are somewhat queasy to be touch’d
have you or seen or heard part of his work
not i he means they shall be public shortly
o cordus do you call him
exeunt natta and satrius
but these our times are not the same arruntius
the men the men are not the same ’tis we are base poor and degenerate from the exalted strain of our great fathers
where is now the soul of god like cato
he that durst be good when cæsar durst be evil and had power as not to live his slave to die his master
or where’s the constant brutus that being proof against all charm of benefits did strike so brave a blow into the monster’s heart that sought unkindly to captive his country
o they are fled the light
those mighty spirits lie raked up with their ashes in their urns and not a spark of their eternal fire glows in a present bosom
all’s but blaze flashes and smoke wherewith we labour so there’s nothing roman in us nothing good gallant or great ’tis true that cordus says brave cassius was the last of all that race
drusus passes over the stage attended by haterius etc
i like the prince well
a riotous youth there’s little hope of him
that fault his age will as it grows correct
methinks he bears himself each day more nobly than other and wins no less on men’s affections than doth his father lose
believe me i love him and chiefly for opposing to sejanus
and i for gracing his young kinsmen so the sons of prince germanicus it shews a gallant clearness in him a straight mind that envies not in them their father’s name
his name was while he lived above all envy and being dead without it
if there were seeds of the old virtue left they lived in him
he had the fruits arruntius more than the seeds sabinus and myself had means to know him within and can report him
we were his followers he would call us friends he was a man most like to virtue in all and every action nearer to the gods than men in nature of a body as fair as was his mind and no less reverend in face than fame he could so use his state tempering his greatness with his gravity as it avoided all self love in him and spite in others
what his funerals lack’d in images and pomp they had supplied with honourable sorrow soldiers’ sadness a kind of silent mourning such as men who know no tears but from their captives use to shew in so great losses
i thought once considering their forms age manner of deaths the nearness of the places where they fell to have parallel’d him with great alexander for both were of best feature of high race year’d but to thirty and in foreign lands by their own people alike made away
i know not for his death how you might wrest it but for his life it did as much disdain comparison with that voluptuous rash giddy and drunken macedon’s as mine doth with my bondman’s
all the good in him his valour and his fortune he made his but he had other touches of late romans that more did speak him pompey’s dignity the innocence of cato cæsar’s spirit wise brutus’ temperance and every virtue which parted unto others gave them name flow’d mix’d in him
he was the soul of goodness and all our praises of him are like streams drawn from a spring that still rise full and leave the part remaining greatest
i am sure he was too great for us and that they knew who did remove him hence
when men grow fast honour’d and loved
there is a trick in state which jealous princes never fail to use how to decline that growth with fair pretext and honourable colours of employment either by embassy the war or such to shift them forth into another air where they may purge and lessen so was he and had his seconds there sent by tiberius and his more subtile dam to discontent him to breed and cherish mutinies detract his greatest actions give audacious check to his commands and work to put him out in open act of treason
all which snares when his wise cares prevented a fine poison was thought on to mature their practices
enter sejanus talking to terentius followed by satrius natta etc
now observe the stoops the bendings and the falls
i note them well no more
my lord there is a gentleman of rome would buy how call you him you talk’d with
please your lordship it is eudemus the physician to livia drusus’ wife
on with your suit
would buy you said a tribune’s place my lord
what will he give
livia’s physician say you is that fellow
it is my lord your lordship’s answer
the place my lord
’tis for a gentleman your lordship will well like of when you see him and one that you may make yours by the grant
well let him bring his money and his name
he shall my lord
know you this same eudemus
reputed so my lord and of deep practice
bring him in to me in the gallery and take you cause to leave us there together i would confer with him about a grief on
exeunt sejanus satrius terentius etc
o desperate state of grovelling honour
seest thou this o sun and do we see thee after
methinks day should lose his light when men do lose their shames and for the empty circumstance of life betray their cause of living
sejanus can repair if jove should ruin
he is now the court god and well applied with sacrifice of knees of crooks and cringes he will do more than all the house of heaven can for a thousand hecatombs
’tis he makes us our day or night hell and elysium are in his look we talk of rhadamanth furies and firebrands but it is his frown that is all these where on the adverse part his smile is more than e’er yet poets feign’d of bliss and shades nectar a serving boy
i knew him at caius’ trencher when for hire he prostituted his abused body to that great gormond fat apicius and was the noted pathic of the time
and now the second face of the whole world
the partner of the empire hath his image rear’d equal with tiberius born in ensigns commands disposes every dignity centurions tribunes heads of provinces praetors and consuls all that heretofore rome’s general suffrage gave is now his sale
the gain or rather spoil of all the earth one and his house receives
he hath of late made him a strength too strangely by reducing all the prætorian bands into one camp which he commands pretending that the soldiers by living loose and scatter’d fell to riot and that if any sudden enterprise should be attempted their united strength would be far more than sever’d and their life more strict if from the city more removed
where now he builds what kind of forts he please is heard to court the soldier by his name woos feasts the chiefest men of action whose wants not loves compel them to be his
and though he ne’er were liberal by kind yet to his own dark ends he’s most profuse lavish and letting fly he cares not what to his ambition
yet hath he ambition
is there that step in state can make him higher or more or anything he is but less
the name tiberius i hope will keep howe’er he hath foregone the dignity and power
sure while he lives
and dead it comes to drusus
should he fail to the brave issue of germanicus and they are three too many ha
for him to have a plot upon
i do not know the heart of his designs but sure their face looks farther than the present
by the gods if i could guess he had but such a thought my sword should cleave him down from head to heart but i would find it out and with my hand i’d hurl his panting brain about the air in mites as small as atomi to undo the knotted bed you are observ’d arruntius
turns to natta terentius etc
i dare tell him so and all his spies you sir i would do you look
the former scene continued
a gallery discovered opening into the state room
enter satrius with eudemus
here he will instant be let’s walk a turn you’re in a muse eudemus
i wonder he should mark me out so
well jove and apollo form it for the best
your fortune’s made unto you now eudemus if you can but lay bold upon the means do but observe his humour andbelieve it he is the noblest roman where he takes enter sejanus
here comes his lordship
this is the gentleman my lord
give me your handwe must be more acquainted
report sir hath spoke out your art and learning and i am glad i have so needful cause however in itself painful and hard to make me known to so great virtue
look who is that satrius
i have a grief sir that will desire your help
it is my lord
i hear you are physician to livia the princess
i minister unto her my good lord
you minister to a royal lady then
she is my lord and fair
that’s understood of all her sex who are or would be so and those that would be physic soon can make them for those that are their beauties fear no colours
your lordship is conceited
sir you know it and can if need be read a learned lecture on this and other secrets
pray you tell me what more of ladies besides livia have you your patients
many my good lord
the great augusta urgulania mutilia prisca and plancina divers and all these tell you the particulars of every several grief
how first it grew and then increased what action caused that what passion that and answer to each point that you will put them
else my lord we know not how to prescribe the remedies
go to you are a subtile nation you physicians
and grown the only cabinets in court to ladies’ privacies
faith which of these is the most pleasant lady in her physic
come you are modest now
’tis fit my lord
why sir i do not ask you of their urines whose smell’s most violet or whose siege is best or who makes hardest faces on her stool
which lady sleeps with her own face a nights
which puts her teeth off with her clothes in court
or which her hair which her complexion and in which box she puts it these were questions that might perhaps have put your gravity to some defence of blush
but i enquired which was the wittiest merriest wantonnest
harmless intergatories but conceits
methinks augusta should be most perverse and froward in her fit
she’s so my lord
i knew it and mutilia the most jocund
’tis very true my lord
and why would you conceal this from me now
come what is livia
i know she’s quick and quaintly spirited and will have strange thoughts when she is at leisure she tells them all to you
my noblest lord he breathes not in the empire or on earth
whom i would be ambitious to serve in any act that may preserve mine honour before your lordship
sir you can lose no honour by trusting aught to me
the coarsest act done to my service i can so requite as all the world shall style it honourable your idle virtuous definitions keep honour poor and are as scorn’d as vain those deeds breathe honour that do suck in gain
but good my lord if i should thus betray the counsels of my patient and a lady’s of her high place and worth what might your lordship who presently are to trust me with your own judge of my faith
only the best i swear
say now that i should utter you my grief and with it the true cause that it were love and love to livia you should tell her this should she suspect your faith i would you could tell me as much from her see if my brain could be turn’d jealous
happily my lord i could in time tell you as much and more so i might safely promise but the first to her from you
as safely my eudemus i now dare call thee so as i have put the secret into thee
my lord protest not thy looks are vows to me use only speed and but affect her with sejanus’ love thou art a man made to make consuls
my lord i’ll promise you a private meeting this day together
my gardens whither i shall fetch your lordship let me adore my æsculapius
why this indeed is physic
and outspeaks the knowledge of cheap drugs or any use can be made out of it
more comforting than all your opiates juleps apozems magistral syrups orbe gone my friend not barely styled but created so expect things greater than thy largest hopes to overtake thee fortune shall be taught to know how ill she hath deserv’d thus long to come behind thy wishes
ambition makes more trusty slaves than need
these fellows by the favour of their art have still the means to tempt oft times the power
if livia will be now corrupted then thou hast the way sejanus to work out his secrets who thou know’st endures thee not her husband drusus and to work against them
prosper it pallas thou that better’st wit for venus hath the smallest share in it
enter tiberius and drusus attended
to haterius who kneels to him
we not endure these flatteries let him stand our empire ensigns axes rods and state take not away our human nature from us look up on us and fall before the gods
how like a god speaks cæsar
he can endure that second that’s no flattery
o what is it proud slime will not believe of his own worth to hear it equal praised thus with the gods
he did not hear it sir
tut he must not we think meanly
’tis your most courtly known confederacy to have your private parasite redeem what he in public subtilely will lose to making him a name
right mighty lord gives him letters
we must make up our ears ’gainst these assaults of charming tongues we pray you use no more these contumelies to us style not us or lord or mighty who profess ourself the servant of the senate and are proud enjoy them our good just and favouring lords
prince like to the life
when power that may command so much descends their bondage whom it stoops to it intends
whence are these letters
are they sitting now
they stay thy answer cæsar
if this man had but a mind allied unto his words how blest a fate were it to us and rome
we could not think that state for which to change although the aim were our old liberty the ghosts of those that fell for that would grieve their bodies lived not now again to serve
men are deceived who think there can be thrall beneath a virtuous prince wish’d liberty ne’er lovelier looks than under such a crown
but when his grace is merely but lip good
and that no longer than he airs himself abroad in public there to seem to shun the strokes and stripes of flatterers which within are lechery unto him and so feed his brutish sense with their afflicting sound as dead to virtue he permits himself be carried like a pitcher by the ears to every act of vice this is the case deserves our fear and doth presage the nigh and close approach of blood and tyranny
flattery is midwife unto prince’s rage and nothing sooner doth help forth a tyrant than that and whisperers’ grace who have the time the place the power to make all men offenders
he should be told this and be bid dissemble with fools and blind men we that know the evil should hunt the palace rats or give them bane fright hence these worse than ravens that devour t he quick where they but prey upon the dead he shall be told it
stay arruntius we must abide our opportunity and practise what is fit as what is needful
it is not safe t’ enforce a sovereign’s ear princes hear well if they at all will hear
ha say you so
in the mean time jove say not but i do call upon thee now ’tis well pray’d
having read the letters
return the lords this voice we are their creature and it is fit a good and honest prince whom they out of their bounty have instructed with so dilate and absolute a power should owe the office of it to their service
and good of all and every citizen
nor shall it e’er repent us to have wish’d the senate just and favouring lords unto us since their free loves do yield no less defence to a prince’s state than his own innocence
say then there can be nothing in their thought shall want to please us that hath pleased them our suffrage rather shall prevent than stay behind their wills ’tis empire to obey where such so great so grave so good determine
yet for the suit of spain to erect a temple in honour of our mother and our self we must with pardon of the senate not assent thereto
their lordships may object our not denying the same late request unto the asian cities we desire that our defence for suffering that be known in these brief reasons with our after purpose
since deified augustus hindered not a temple to be built at pergamum in honour of himself and sacred rome we that have all his deeds and words observed ever in place of laws the rather follow’d that pleasing precedent because with ours the senate’s reverence also there was join’d
but as t’ have once received it may deserve the gain of pardon so to be adored with the continued style and note of gods through all the provinces were wild ambition
and no less pride yea even augustus’ name would early vanish should it be profaned with such promiscuous flatteries
for our part we here protest it and are covetous posterity should know it
we are mortal and can but deeds of men ’twere glory enough could we be truly a prince
and they shall add abounding grace unto our memory that shall report us worthy our forefathers careful of your affairs constant in dangers and not afraid of any private frown for public good
these things shall be to us temples and statues reared in your minds the fairest and most during imagery for those of stone or brass if they become odious in judgment of posterity are more contemn’d as dying sepulchres than ta’en for living monuments
we then make here our suit alike to gods and men the one until the period of our race to inspire us with a free and quiet mind discerning both divine and human laws the other to vouchsafe us after death an honourable mention and fair praise to accompany our actions and our name the rest of greatness princes may command and therefore may neglect only a long a lasting high and happy memory they should without being satisfied pursue contempt of fame begets contempt of virtue
the oracles are ceased that only cæsar with their tongue might speak
let me be gone most felt and open this
to hear more cunning and fine words with their sound flatter’d ere their sense be meant
their choice of antium there to place the gift vow’d to the goddess for our mother’s health we will the senate know we fairly like as also of their grant to lepidus for his repairing the aemilian place and restoration of those monuments their grace too in confining of silanus to the other isle cithera at the suit of his religious sister much commends their policy so temper’d with their mercy
but for the honours which they have decreed to our sejanus to advance his statue in pompey’s theatre whose ruining fire his vigilance and labour kept restrain’d in that one loss they have therein out gone their own great wisdoms by their skilful choice and placing of their bounties on a man whose merit more adorns the dignity than that can him and gives a benefit in taking greater than it can receive
blush not sejanus thou great aid of rome associate of our labours our chief helper let us not force thy simple modesty with offering at thy praise for more we cannot since there’s no voice can take it
no man here receive our speeches as hyperboles for we are far from flattering our friend let envy know as from the need to flatter
nor let them ask the causes of our praise princes have still their grounds rear’d with themselves above the poor low flats of common men and who will search the reasons of their acts must stand on equal bases
lead away our loves unto the senate
exeunt tiberius sejanus natta haterius latiaris officers etc
great pompey’s theatre was never ruin’d till now that proud sejanus hath a statue rear’d on his ashes
place the shame of soldiers above the best of generals
crack the world and bruise the name of romans into dust ere we behold it
check your passion lord drusus tarries
is my father mad weary of life and rule lords
thus to heave an idol up with praise
make him his mate his rival in the empire
allow him statues titles honours such as he himself refuseth
the first ascents to sovereignty are hard but entered once there never wants or means or ministers to help the aspirer on
we must shortly pray to modesty that he will rest contented ay where he is and not write emperor
re enter sejanus satrius latiaris clients etc
there is your bill and yours bring you your man
i have moved for you too latiaris
is your vast greatness grown so blindly bold that you will over us
why then give way
what stand you off
it looks too full of death for thy cold spirits
avoid mine eye dull camel or my sword shall make thy bravery fitter for a grave than for a triumph
i’ll advance a statue your own bulk but ’t shall be on the cross where i will nail your pride at breadth and length and crack those sinews which are yet but stretch’d with your swoln fortune’s rage
a castor a castor a castor a castor
exeunt all but sejanus
he that with such wrong moved can bear it through with patience and an even mind knows how to turn it back
wrath cover’d carries fate revenge is lost if i profess my hate
what was my practice late i’ll now pursue as my fell justice this hath styled it new
the garden of enter sejanus livia and eudemus
physician thou art worthy of a province
for the great favours done unto our loves and but that greatest livia bears a part in the requital of thy services i should alone despair of aught like means to give them worthy satisfaction
eudemus i will see it shall receive a fit and full reward for his large merit
but for this potion we intend to drusus no more our husband now whom shall we choose as the most apt and able instrument to minister it to him
an eunuch drusus loves
ay and his cup bearer
name not a second
if drusus love him and he have that place we cannot think a fitter
for free access and trust are two main aids
but he must be wrought to the undertaking with some labour’d art
yet gold is a good general charm
what is he then
faith only wanton light
is he young and fair
send him to me i’ll work him
royal lady though i have loved you long and with that height of zeal and duty like the fire which more it mounts it trembles thinking nought could add unto the fervour which your eye had kindled yet now i see your wisdom judgment strength quickness and will to apprehend the means to your own good and greatness i protest myself through rarified and turn’d all flame in your affection such a spirit as yours was not created for the idle second to a poor flash as drusus but to shine bright as the moon among the lesser lights and share the sov’reignty of all the world
then livia triumphs in her proper sphere when she and her sejanus shall divide the name of cæsar and augusta’ s star be dimm’d with glory of a brighter beam when agrippina’s fires are quite extinct and the scarce soon tiberius borrows all his little light from us whose folded arms shall make one perfect orb
’tis not drusus lady do not fear
not i my lord my fear and love of him left me at once
illustrious lady stay within
i’ll tell his lordship
who is it eudemus
one of your lordship’s servants brings you word the emperor hath sent for you
with your fair leave dear princess i’ll but ask a question and return
how are you blest in the fruition of this unequall’d man the soul of rome the empire’s life and voice of cæsar’s world
so blessed my eudemus as to know the bliss i have with what i ought to owe the means that wrought it
how do i look to day
excellent clear believe it
this same fucus was well laid on
methinks ’tis here not white
lend me your scarlet lady
’tis the sun hath giv’n some little taint unto the ceruse you should have used of the white oil i gave you
sejanus for your love
his very name commandeth above cupid or his shafts paints her cheeks
nay now you’ve made it worse
i’ll help it straight and but pronounced is a sufficient charm against all rumour and of absolute power to satisfy for any lady’s honour
what do you now eudemus
make a light fucus to touch you o’er withal
what act though ne’er so strange and insolent but that addition will at least bear out if’t do not expiate
i like this study to preserve the love of such a man that comes not every hour to greet the world
’tis now well lady you should use of the dentifrice i prescribed you too to clear your teeth and the prepared pomatum to smooth the skina lady cannot be too curious of her form that still would hold the heart of such a person made her captive as you have his who to endear him more in your clear eye hath put away his wife the trouble of his bed and your delights fair apicata and made spacious room to your new pleasures
have not we return’d that with our hate to drusus and discovery of all his counsels
yes and wisely lady
the ages that succeed and stand far off to gaze at your high prudence shall admire and reckon it an act without your sex it hath that rare appearance
some will think your fortune could not yield a deeper sound than mix’d with drusus but when they shall hear that and the thunder of sejanus meet sejanus whose high name doth strike the stars and rings about the concave great sejanus whose glories style and titles are himself the often iterating of sejanus they then will lose their thoughts and be ashamed to take acquaintance of them
i must make a rude departure lady cæsar sends with all his haste both of command and prayer
be resolute in our plot you have my soul as certain yours as it is my body’s
and wise physician so prepare the poison as you may lay the subtile operation upon some natural disease of his your eunuch send to me
i kiss your hands glory of ladies and commend my love to your best faith and memory
my lord i shall but change your words
yet this remember for your heed he loves you not you know what i have told you his designs are full of grudge and danger we must use more than a common speed
excellent lady how you do fire my blood
well you must go
the thoughts be best are least set forth to shew
when will you take some physic lady
when i shall eudemus but let drusus’ drug be first prepared
were lygdus made that’s done i have it ready
and to morrow morning i’ll send you a perfume first to resolve and procure sweat and then prepare a bath to cleanse and clear the cutis against when i’ll have an excellent new fucus made resistive ’gainst the sun the rain or wind which you shall lay on with a breath or oil as you best like and last some fourteen hours
this change came timely lady for your health and the restoring your complexion which drusus’ choler had almost burnt up
wherein your fortune hath prescribed you better than art could do
thanks good physician i’ll use my fortune you shall see with reverence
is my coach ready
it attends your highness
an apartment in the palace
if this be not revenge when i have done and made it perfect let egyptian slaves parthians and bare foot hebrews brand my face and print my body full of injuries
thou lost thyself child drusus when thou thoughtst thou couldst outskip my vengeance or outstand the power i had to crush thee into air
thy follies now shall taste what kind of man they have provoked and this thy father’s house crack in the flame of my incensed rage whose fury shall admit no shame or mean
it is the lightest ill i will commit a race of wicked acts shall flow out of my anger and o’erspread the world’s wide face which no posterity shall e’er approve nor yet keep silent things that for their cunning close and cruel mark thy father would wish his and shall perhaps carry the empty name but we the prize
on then my soul and start not in thy course though heaven drop sulphur and hell belch out fire laugh at the idle terrors tell proud jove between his power and thine there is no odds ’twas only fear first in the world made gods
is yet sejanus come
he’s here dread cæsar
let all depart that chamber and the next
sit down my comfort
when the master prince of all the world sejanus saith he fears is it not fatal
yes to those are fear’d
and not to him
not if he wisely turn that part of fate he holdeth first on them
that nature blood and laws of kind forbid
do policy and state forbid it
the rest of poor respects then let go by state is enough to make the act just them guilty
long hate pursues such acts
whom hatred frights let him not dream of sovereignty
are rites of faith love piety to be trod down forgotten and made vain
all for a crown
the prince who shames a tyrant’s name to bear shall never dare do any thing but fear all the command of sceptres quite doth perish if it begin religious thoughts to cherish whole empires fall sway’d by those nice respects it is the license of dark deeds protects ev’n states most hated when no laws resist the sword
but that it acteth what it list
yet so we may do all things cruelly not safely
yes and do them thoroughly
knows yet sejanus whom we point at
ay or else my thought my sense or both do err ’tis agrippina
she and her proud race
dangerous cæsar for in them apace the father’s spirit shoots up
germanicus lives in their looks their gait their form t’ upbraid us with his close death if not revenge the same
the act’s not known
not proved but whispering fame knowledge and proof doth to the jealous give who than to fail would their own thought believe
it is not safe the children draw long breath that are provoked by a parent’s death
it is as dangerous to make them hence if nothing but their birth be their offence
stay till they strike at cæsar then their crime will be enough but late and out of time for him to punish
do they purpose it
you know sir thunder speaks not till it hit
be not secure none swiftlier are opprest than they whom confidence betrays to rest
let not your daring make your danger such all power is to be fear’d where ’tis too much
the youths are of themselves hot violent full of great thought and that male spirited dame their mother slacks no means to put them on by large allowance popular presentings increase of train and state suing for titles hath them commended with like prayers like vows to the same gods with cæsar days and nights she spends in banquets and ambitious feasts for the nobility where caius silius titius sabinus old arruntius asinius gallus furnius regulus and others of that discontented list are the prime guests
there and to these she tells whose niece she was whose daughter and whose wife
and then must they compare her with augusta ay and prefer her too commend her form extol her fruitfulness at which a shower falls for the memory of germanicus which they blow over straight with windy praise and puffing hopes of her aspiring sons who with these hourly ticklings grow so pleased and wantonly conceited of themselves as now they stick not to believe they’re such as these do give them out and would be thought more than competitors immediate heirs
whilst to their thirst of rule they win the rout that’s still the friend of novelty with hope of future freedom which on every change that greedily though emptily expects
cæsar ’tis age in all things breeds neglects and princes that will keep old dignity must not admit too youthful heirs stand by not their own issue but so darkly set as shadows are in picture to give height and lustre to themselves
we will command their rank thoughts down and with a stricter hand than we have yet put forth their trains must bate their titles feasts and factions
but how sir will you work
they are too great and that too faint a blow to give them now it would have serv’d at first when with the weakest touch their knot had burst
but now your care must be not to detect the smallest cord or line of your suspect for such who know the weight of prince’s fear will when they find themselves discover’d rear their forces like seen snakes that else would lie roll’d in their circles close nought is more high daring or desperate than offenders found where guilt is rage and courage both abound
the course must be to let them still swell up riot and surfeit on blind fortune’s cup give them more place more dignities more style call them to court to senate in the while take from their strength some one or twain or more of the main factors it will fright the store and by some by occasion
thus with slight you shall disarm them first and they in night of their ambition not perceive the train till in the engine they are caught and slain
we would not kill if we knew how to save yet than a throne ’tis cheaper give a grave
is there no way to bind them by deserts
sir wolves do change their hair but not their hearts
while thus your thought unto a mean is tied you neither dare enough nor do provide
all modesty is fond and chiefly where the subject is no less compell’d to bear than praise his sovereign’s acts
we can no longer keep on our mask to thee our dear sejanus thy thoughts are ours in all and we but proved their voice in our designs which by assenting hath more confirm’d us than if heart’ning jove had from his hundred statues bid us strike and at the stroke click’d all his marble thumbs
but who shall first be struck
first caius silius he is the most of mark and most of danger in power and reputation equal strong having commanded an imperial army seven years together vanquish’d sacrovir in germany and thence obtain’d to wear the ornaments triumphal
his steep fall by how much it doth give the weightier crack will send more wounding terror to the rest command them stand aloof and give more way to our surprising of the principal
let him grow a while his fate is not yet ripe we must not pluck at all together lest we catch ourselves
and there’s arruntius too he only talks
but sosia silius’ wife would be wound in now for she hath a fury in her breast more than hell ever knew and would be sent thither in time
then is there one cremutius cordus a writing fellow they have got to gather notes of the precedent times and make them into annals a most tart and bitter spirit i hear who under colour of praising those doth tax the present state censures the men the actions leaves no trick no practice unexamined parallels the times the governments a profest champion for the old liberty a perishing wretch
as if there were that chaos bred in things that laws and liberty would not rather choose to be quite broken and ta’en hence by us than have the stain to be preserved by such
have we the means to make these guilty first
trust that to me let cæsar by his power but cause a formal meeting of the senate i will have matter and accusers ready
we shall misspend the time of action
counsels are unfit in business where all rest is more pernicious than rashness can be
acts of this close kind thrive more by execution than advice
there is no lingering in that work begun which cannot praised be until through done
our edicts shall forthwith command a court
while i can live i will prevent earth’s fury ἐμοῦ θανόντος γαῖα μιχθήτω πυρι
my lord sejanus julius posthumus
come with my wish
what news from agrippina’s
they all lock up themselves a’ late or talk in character i have not seen a company so changed
except they had intelligence by augury of our practice
when were you there
and what guests found you
sabinus silius the old list arruntius furmus and gallus
would not these talk
little and yet we offer’d choice of argument
satrius was with me
well ’tis guilt enough their often meeting
you forgot to extol the hospitable lady
no that trick was well put home and had succeeded too but that sabinus cough’d a caution out for she began to swell
and may she burst
julius i would have you go instantly unto the palace of the great augusta and by your kindest friend get swift access acquaint her with these meetings tell the words you brought me the other day of silius add somewhat to them
make her understand the danger of sabinus and the times out of his closeness
give arruntius’ words of malice against cæsar so to gallus but above all to agrippina
say as you may truly that her infinite pride propt with the hopes of her too fruitful womb with popular studies gapes for sovereignty and threatens cæsar
pray augusta then that for her own great cæsar’s and the public safety she be pleased to urge these dangers
cæsar is too secure he must be told and best he’ll take it from a mother’s tongue
what is’t for us to sound to explore to watch oppose plot practise or prevent if he for whom it is so strongly labour’d shall out of greatness and free spirit be supinely negligent
our city’s now divided as in time o’ the civil war and men forbear not to declare themselves of agrippina’s party
every day the faction multiplies and will do more if not resisted you can best enlarge it as you find audience
noble posthumus commend me to your prisca and pray her she will solicit this great business to earnest and most present execution with all her utmost credit with augusta
i shall not fail in my instructions
this second from his mother will well urge our late design and spur on cæsar’s rage which else might grow remiss
the way to put a prince in blood is to present the shapes of dangers greater than they are like late or early shadows and sometimes to feign where there are none only to make him fear
his fear will make him cruel and once enter’d he doth not easily learn to stop or spare where he may doubt
this have i made my rule to thrust tiberius into tyranny and make him toil to turn aside those blocks which i alone could not remove with safety drusus once gone germanicus’ three sons would clog my way whose guards have too much faith to be corrupted and their mother known of too too unreproved a chastity to be attempted as light livia was
work then my art on cæsar’s fears as they on those they fear ’till all my lets be clear’d and he in ruins of his house and hate of all his subjects bury his own state when with my peace and safety i will rise by making him the public sacrifice
enter satrius and natta
they’re grown exceeding circumspect and wary
they have us in the wind and yet arruntius cannot contain himself
tut he’s not yet look’d after there are others more desired that are more silent
enter sabinus arruntius and cordus
how is it that these beagles haunt the house of agrippina
o they hunt they hunt
there is some game here lodged which they must rouse to make the great ones sport
did you observe how they inveigh’d ’gainst cæsar
ay baits baits for us to bite at would i have my flesh torn by the public hook these qualified hangmen should be my company
domitius afer passes over the stage
ay there’s a man afer the orator
one that hath phrases figures and fine flowers to strew his rhetoric with and doth make haste to get him note or name by any offer where blood or gain be objects steeps his words when he would kill in artificial tears the crocodile of tyber
him i love that man is mine he hath my heart and voice when i would curse
contemn the slaves their present lives will be their future graves
another apartment in the same
enter silius agrippina nero and sosia
may’t please your highness not forget yourself i dare not with my manners to attempt your trouble farther
sosia stays with us
she is your servant and doth owe your grace an honest but unprofitable love
how can that be when there’s no gain but virtue’s
you take the moral not the politic sense
i meant as she is bold and free of speech earnest to utter what her zealous thought travails withal in honour of your house which act as it is simply born in her partakes of love and honesty but may by the over often and unseason’d use turn to your loss and danger for your state is waited on by envies as by eyes and every second guest your tables take is a fee’d spy to observe who goes who comes what conference you have with whom where when
what the discourse is what the looks the thoughts of every person there they do extract and make into a substance
were all tiberius’ body stuck with eyes and every wall and hanging in my house transparent this lawn i wear or air yea had sejanus both his ears as long as to my inmost closet i would hate to whisper any thought or change an act to be made juno’s rival
virtue’s forces shew ever noblest in conspicuous courses
’tis great and bravely spoken like the spirit of agrippina yet your highness knows there is nor loss nor shame in providence few can what all should do beware enough
you may perceive with what officious face satrius and natta afer and the rest
visit your house of late to enquire the secrets and with what bold and privileged art they rail against augusta yea and at tiberius tell tricks of livia and sejanus all to excite and call your indignation on that they might hear it at more liberty
you’re too suspicious silius
pray the gods i be so agrippina but i fear some subtle practice
they that durst to strike at so exampless and unblamed a life as that of the renowned germanicus will not sit down with that exploit alone he threatens many that hath injured one
’twere best rip forth their tongues sear out their eyes
when next they come
a fit reward for spies
hear you the rumour
you were with him yesternight
one met eudemus the physician sent for but now who thinks he cannot live
if it be arrived at that he knows or none
what should be his disease
poison poison how silius
there was late a certain blow given o’ the face
and what of that
i’m glad i gave it not
but there is somewhat else
yes private meetings with a great lady sir at a physician’s and a wife turn’d away
toys mere toys what wisdom’s now in th’ streets in the common mouth
fears whisperings tumults noise i know not what they say the senate sit
i’ll thither straight and see what’s in the forge
good silius do sosia and i will in
haste you my lords i to visit the sick prince tender your loves and sorrows to the people
this sejanus trust my divining soul hath plots on all no tree that stops his prospect but must fall
the senate house enter præcones lictores sejanus varro latiaris cotta and afer
’tis only you must urge against him varro nor i nor cæsar may appear therein except in your defence who are the consul and under colour of late enmity between your father and his may better do it as free from all suspicion of a practice
here be your notes what points to touch at read be cunning in them
afer has them too
but is he summon’d
it was debated by cæsar and concluded as most fit to take him unprepared
and prosecute all under name of treason
enter sabinus gallus lepidus and arruntius
drusus being dead cæsar will not be here
what should the business of this senate be
that can my subtle whisperers tell you we that are the good dull noble lookers on are only call’d to keep the marble warm
what should we do with those deep mysteries proper to these fine heads
our ignorance may perchance help us be saved from whips and furies
see see see their action
ay now their heads do travail now they work their faces run like shittles they are weaving some curious cobweb to catch flies
observe they take their places
o yes they must be seen to flatter cæsar’s grief though but in sitting
fathers conscript may this our present meeting turn fair and fortunate to the common wealth
enter silius and other senators
silius forbear thy place
silius stand forth the consul hath to charge thee
is he come too
nay then expect a trick
sure he will answer nobly
we stand amazed fathers to behold this general dejection
wherefore sit rome’s consuls thus dissolved as they had lost all the remembrance both of style and place it not becomes
no woes are of fit weight to make the honour of the empire stoop though i in my peculiar self may meet just reprehension that so suddenly and in so fresh a grief would greet the senate when private tongues of kinsmen and allies inspired with comforts lothly are endured the face of men not seen and scarce the day to thousands that communicate our loss
nor can i argue these of weakness since they take but natural ways yet i must seek for stronger aids and those fair helps draw out from warm embraces of the common wealth
our mother great augusta ’s struck with time our self imprest with aged characters drusus is gone his children young and babes our aims must now reflect on those that may give timely succour to these present ills and are our only glad surviving hopes the noble issue of germanicus nero and drusus might it please the consul honour them in they both attend without
i would present them to the senate’s care and raise those suns of joy that should drink up these floods of sorrow in your drowned eyes
by jove i am not œdipus enough to understand this sphynx
enter nero and drusus junior
approach you noble nero noble drusus
these princes fathers when their parent died i gave unto their uncle with this prayer that though he had proper issue of his own he would no less bring up and foster these than that self blood and by that act confirm their worths to him and to posterity
drusus ta’en hence i turn my prayers to you and ’fore our country and our gods beseech you take and rule augustus’ nephew’s sons sprung of the noblest ancestors and so accomplish both my duty and your own nero and drusus these shall be to you in place of parents these your fathers these and not unfitly for you are so born as all your good or ill’s the common wealth’s
receive them you strong guardians and blest gods make all their actions answer to their bloods let their great titles find increase by them not they by titles
set them as in place so in example above all the romans and may they know no rivals but themselves
let fortune give them nothing but attend upon their virtue and that still come forth greater than hope and better than their fame
relieve me fathers with your general voice
may all the gods consent to cæsar’s wish and add to any honours that may crown the hopeful issue of germanicus
we thank you reverend fathers in their right
if this were true now
but the space the space between the breast and lipstiberius’ heart lies a thought further than another man’s
my comforts are so flowing in my joys as in them all my streams of grief are lost no less than are land waters in the sea or showers in rivers though their cause was such as might have sprinkled ev’n the gods with tears yet since the greater doth embrace the less we covetously obey
and now i am the happy witness made of your so much desired affections to this great issue i could wish the fates would here set peaceful period to my days however to my labours i entreat and beg it of this senate some fit ease
laugh fathers laugh have you no spleens about you
the burden is too heavy i sustain on my unwilling shoulders and i pray it may be taken off and reconferred upon the consuls or some other roman more able and more worthy
why this doth render all the rest suspected
o do you taste it then
it takes away my faith to any thing he shall hereafter speak
ay to pray that which would be to his head as hot as thunder ’gainst which he wears that charm should but the court receive him at his word
for myself i know my weakness and so little covet like some gone past the weight that will oppress me as my ambition is the counter point
finely maintained good still
but rome whose blood whose nerves whose life whose very frame relies on cæsar’s strength no less than heaven on atlas cannot admit it but with general ruin
are you there to bring him off
let cæsar no more then urge a point so contrary to cæsar’s greatness the grieved senate’s vows or rome’s necessity
he comes about more nimbly than vertumnus
for the publick i may be drawn to shew i can neglect all private aims though i affect my rest but if the senate still command me serve i must be glad to practise my obedience
you must and will sir
we do know it
cæsar live long and happy great and royal cæsar the gods preserve thee and thy modesty thy wisdom and thy innocence where is’t
the prayer is made before the subject
guard his meekness jove his piety his care his bounty and his subtility i’ll put in yet he’ll keep that himself without the gods
all prayers are vain for him
we will not hold your patience fathers with long answer but shall still contend to be what you desire and work to satisfy so great a hope
proceed to your affairs
now silius guard thee the curtain’s drawing
the triumph that thou hadst in germany for thy late victory on sacrovir thou hast enjoy’d so freely caius silius as no man it envied thee nor would cæsar or rome admit that thou wert then defrauded of any honours thy deserts could claim in the fair service of the common wealth but now if after all their loves and graces thy actions and their courses being discover’d it shall appear to cæsar and this senate thou hast defiled those glories with thy crimes crimes
tell thy mule of patience i am a roman
what are my crimes
am i too rich too honest for the times
have i or treasure jewels land or houses that some informer gapes for
is my strength too much to be admitted or my knowledge
these now are crimes
nay silius if the name of crime so touch thee with what impotence wilt thou endure the matter to be search’d
i tell thee afer with more scorn than fear employ your mercenary tongue and art
is he thrust in
’tis i accuse thee silius
against the majesty of rome and cæsar i do pronounce thee here a guilty cause first of beginning and occasioning next drawing out the war in gallia for which thou late triumph’st dissembling long that sacrovir to be an enemy only to make thy entertainment more
whilst thou and thy wife sosia poll’d the province wherein with sordid base desire of gain thou hast discredited thy actions’ worth and been a traitor to the state
i thank thee silius speak so still and often
if i not prove it cæsar but unjustly have call’d him into trial here i bind myself to suffer what i claim against him and yield to have what i have spoke confirm’d by judgment of the court and all good men
cæsar i crave to have my cause deferr’d till this man’s consulship be out
we cannot nor may we grant it
shall he design my day of trial
is he my accuser and must he be my judge
it hath been usual and is a right that custom hath allow’d the magistrate to call forth private men and to appoint their day which privilege we may not in the consul see infringed by whose deep watches and industrious care it is so labour’d as the common wealth receive no loss by any oblique course
cæsar thy fraud is worse than violence
silius mistake us not we dare not use the credit of the consul to thy wrong but only to preserve his place and power so far as it concerns the dignity and honour of the state
why so he may arruntius
and he may choose too
by the capitol and all our gods but that the dear republic our sacred laws and just authority are interess’d therein i should be silent
please cæsar to give way unto his trial he shall have justice
nay i shall have law shall i not afer
would you have more
no my well spoken man i would no more nor less might i enjoy it natural
not taught to speak unto your present ends free from thine his and all your unkind handling furious enforcing most unjust presuming malicious and manifold applying foul wresting and impossible construction
he raves he raves
thou durst not tell me so hadst thou not cæsar’s warrant
i can see whose power condemns me
this betrays his spirit this doth enough declare him what he is
an enemy to the state
because i am an enemy to thee and such corrupted ministers o’ the state that here art made a present instrument to gratify it with thine own disgrace
this to the consul is most insolent and impious
i scent not your confederacies your plots and combinations
i not know minion sejanus hates me and that all this boast of law and law is but a form a net of vulcan’s filing a mere ingine to take that life by a pretext of justice which you pursue in malice
i want brain or nostril to persuade me that your ends and purposes are made to what they are before my answer
o you equal gods whose justice not a world of wolf turn’d men shall make me to accuse howe’er provoked have i for this so oft engaged myself
stood in the heat and fervour of a fight when phœbus sooner hath forsook the day than i the field against the blue eyed gauls and crisped germans
when our roman eagles have fann’d the fire with their labouring wings and no blow dealt that left not death behind it
when i have charged alone into the troops of curl’d sicambrians routed them and came not off with backward ensigns of a slave but forward marks wounds on my breast and face were meant to thee o cæsar and thy rome
and have i this return
did i for this perform so noble and so brave defeat on sacrovir
o jove let it become me to boast my deeds when he whom they concern shall thus forget them
silius silius these are the common customs of thy blood when it is high with wine as now with rage this well agrees with that intemperate vaunt thou lately mad’st at agrippina’s table that when all other of the troops were prone to fall into rebellion only thine remain’d in their obedience
thou wert he that saved the empire which had then been lost had but thy legions there rebell’d or mutined thy virtue met and fronted every peril
thou gav’st to cæsar and to rome their surety their name their strength their spirit and their state their being was a donative from thee
well worded and most like an orator
is this true silius
save thy question cæsar thy spy of famous credit hath affirm’d it
he doth answer stoutly
if this be so there needs no farther cause of crime against him
what can more impeach the royal dignity and state of cæsar than to be urged with a benefit he cannot pay
in this all ceesar’s fortune is made unequal to the courtesy
his means are clean destroyed that should requite
nothing is great enough for silius’ merit
gallus on that side too
come do not hunt and labour so about for circumstance to make him guilty whom you have foredoom’d take shorter ways i’ll meet your purposes
the words were mine and more i now will say since i have done thee that great service cæsar thou still hast fear’d me and in place of grace return’d me hatred so soon all best turns with doubtful princes turn deep injuries in estimation when they greater rise than can be answer’d
benefits with you are of no longer pleasure than you can with ease restore them that transcended once your studies are not how to thank but kill
it is your nature to have all men slaves to you but you acknowledging to none
the means that make your greatness must not come in mention of it if it do it takes so much away you think and that which help’d shall soonest perish if it stand in eye where it may front or but upbraid the high
suffer him speak no more
note but his spirit
this shews him in the rest
let him be censured
he hath spoke enough to prove him cæsar’s foe
his thoughts look through his words
stay stay most officious senate i shall straight delude thy fury
silius hath not placed his guards within him against fortune’s spite so weakly but he can escape your gripe that are but hands of fortune she herself when virtue doth oppose must lose her threats
all that can happen in humanity the frown of cæsar proud sejanus’ hatred base varro’s spleen and afer’s bloodying tongue the senate’s servile flattery and these muster’d to kill i’m fortified against and can look down upon they are beneath me
it is not life whereof i stand enamour’d nor shall my end make me accuse my fate
the coward and the valiant man must fall only the cause and manner how discerns them which then are gladdest when they cost us dearest
romans if any here be in this senate would know to mock tiberius’ tyranny look upon silius and so learn to die
look is he dead
’twas nobly struck and home
my thought did prompt him to it
be famous ever for thy great example
we are not pleased in this sad accident that thus hath stalled and abused our mercy intended to preserve thee noble roman and to prevent thy hopes
now he is full he howls
cæsar doth wrong his dignity and safety thus to mourn the deserv’d end of so profest a traitor and doth by this his lenity instruct others as factious to the like offence
the confiscation merely of his state had been enough
o that was gaped for then
let citation go out for sosia
let her be proscribed and for the goods i think it fit that half go to the treasure half unto the children
with leave of cæsar i would think that fourth the which the law doth cast on the informers should be enough the rest go to the children
wherein the prince shall shew humanity and bounty not to force them by their want which in their parents’ trespass they deserv’d to take ill courses
it shall please us
ay out of necessity
this lepidus is grave and honest and i have observed a moderation still in all his censures
and bending to the betterstay who’s this
enter satrius and natta with cremutius cordus guarded
is he brought in
more blood into the banquet
noble cordus i wish thee good be as thy writings free and honest
for the annals cæsar
satrius secundus pinnarius natta you are his accusers
two of sejanus’ blood hounds whom he breeds with human flesh to bay at citizens
stand forth before the senate and confront him
i do accuse thee here cremutius cordus to be a man factious and dangerous a sower of sedition in the state a turbulent and discontented spirit which i will prove from thine own writings here the annals thou hast publish’d where thou bit’st the present age and with a viper’s tooth being a member of it dar’st that ill which never yet degenerous bastard did upon his parent
to this i subscribe and forth a world of more particulars instance in only one comparing men and times thou praisest brutus and affirm’st that cassius was the last of all the romans
what are we then
my lords this strikes at every roman’s private in whom reigns gentry and estate of spirit to have a brutus brought in parallel a parricide an enemy of his country rank’d and preferr’d to any real worth that rome now holds
this is most strangely invective most full of spite and insolent upbraiding
nor is’t the time alone is here disprised but the whole man of time yea cæsar’s self brought in disvalue and he aimed at most by oblique glance of his licentious pen
cæsar if cassius were the last of romans thou hast no name
let’s hear him answer
so innocent i am of fact my lords as but my words are argued yet those words not reaching either prince or prince’s parent the which your law of treason comprehends
brutus and cassius i am charged to have praised whose deeds when many more besides myself have writ not one hath mention’d without honour
great titus livius great for eloquence and faith amongst us in his history with so great praises pompey did extol as oft augustus call’d him a pompeian yet this not hurt their friendship
in his book he often names scipio afranius yea the same cassius and this brutus too as worthiest men not thieves and parricides which notes upon their fames are now imposed
asinius pollio’s writings quite throughout give them a noble memory so messala renown’d his general cassius yet both these lived with augustus full of wealth and honours to cicero’s book where cato was heav’d up equal with heaven what else did cæsar answer being then dictator but with a penn’d oration as if before the judges
do but see antonius’ letters read but brutus’ pleadings what vile reproach they hold against augustus false i confess but with much bitterness
the epigrams of bibaculus and catullus are read full stuft with spite of both the cæsars yet deified julius and no less augustus both bore them and contemn’d them i not know promptly to speak it whether done with more temper or wisdom for such obloquies if they despised be they die supprest but if with rage acknowledg’d they are confest
the greeks i slip whose license not alone but also lust did scape unpunished or where some one by chance exception took he words with words revenged
but in my work what could be aim’d more free or farther off from the time’s scandal than to write of those whom death from grace or hatred had exempted
did i with brutus and with cassius arm’d and possess’d of the philippi fields incense the people in the civil cause with dangerous speeches
or do they being slain seventy years since as by their images which not the conqueror hath defaced appears retain that guilty memory with writers
posterity pays every man his honour nor shall there want though i condemned am that will not only cassius well approve and of great brutus’ honour mindful be but that will also mention make of me
freely and nobly spoken
with good temper i like him that he is not moved with passion
he puts them to their whisper
take him hence we shall determine of him at next sitting
exeunt officers with cordus
mean time give order that his books be burnt to the aediles
you have well advised
it fits not such licentious things should live t’upbraid the age
if the age were good they might
let them be burnt
all sought and burnt to day
the court is up lictors resume the fasces
exeunt all but arruntius sabinus and lepidus
let them be burnt
o how ridiculous appears the senate’s brainless diligence who think they can with present power extinguish the memory of all succeeding times
’tis true when contrary the punishment of wit doth make the authority increase
nor do they aught that use this cruelty of interdiction and this rage of burning but purchase to themselves rebuke and shame and to the writers an eternal name
it is an argument the times are sore when virtue cannot safely be advanced nor vice reproved
ay noble lepidus augustus well foresaw what we should suffer under tiberius when he did pronounce the roman race most wretched that should live between so slow jaws and so long a bruising
room in the palace
enter tiberius and sejanus
this business hath succeeded well sejanus and quite removed all jealousy of practice ’gainst agrippina and our nephews
now we must bethink us how to plant our ingine for th’ other pair sabinus and arruntius and gallus too howe’er he flatter us his heart we know
give it some respite cæsar
time shall mature and bring to perfect crown what we with so good vultures have begun sabinus shall be next
by any means preserve him
his frank tongue being let the reins would take away all thought of malice in your course against the rest we must keep him to stalk with
dearest head to thy most fortunate design i yield it
siri have been so long train’d up in grace first with your father great augustus since with your most happy bounties so familiar as i not sooner would commit my hopes or wishes to the gods
than to your ears
nor have i ever yet been covetous of over bright and dazzling honour rather to watch and travail in great cæsar’s safety with the most common soldier
the only gain and which i count most fair of all my fortunes is that mighty cæsar has thought me worthy his alliance
hence begin my hopes
i have heard augustus in the bestowing of his daughter thought but even of gentlemen of rome if so i know not how to hope so great a favour but if a husband should be sought for livia and i he had in mind as cæsar’s friend i would but use the glory of the kindred it should not make me slothful or less caring for cæsar’s state it were enough to me it did confirm and strengthen my weak house against the now unequal opposition of agrippina and for dear regard unto my children this i wish myself have no ambition farther than to end my days in service of so dear a master
we cannot but commend thy piety most loved sejanus in acknowledging those bounties which we faintly such remember but to thy suit
the rest of mortal men in all their drifts and counsels pursue profit princes alone are of a different sort directing their main actions still to fame we therefore will take time to think and answer
for livia she can best herself resolve if she will marry after drusus or continue in the family besides she hath a mother and a grandam yet whose nearer counsels she may guide her by but i will simply deal
that enmity thou fear’st in agrippina would burn more if livia’s marriage should as ’twere in parts divide the imperial house an emulation between the women might break forth and discord ruin the sons and nephews on both hands
what if it cause some present difference
thou art not safe sejanus if thou prove it
canst thou believe that livia first the wife to caius cæsar then my drusus now will be contented to grow old with thee born but a private gentleman of rome and raise thee with her loss if not her shame
or say that i should wish it canst thou think the senate or the people who have seen her brother father and our ancestors in highest place of empire will endure it
the state thou hold’st already is in talk men murmur at thy greatness and the noble
stick not in public to upbraid thy climbing above our father’s favours or thy scale and dare accuse me from their hate to thee
be wise dear friend
we would not hide these things for friendship’s dear respect nor will we stand adverse to thine or livia’s designments
what we have purposed to thee in our thought and with what near degrees of love to bind thee and make thee equal to us for the present we will forbear to speak
only thus much believe our loved sejanus we not know that height in blood or honour which thy virtue and mind to us may not aspire with merit
and this we’ll publish on all watch’d occasion the senate or the people shall present
i am restored and to my sense again which i had lost in this so blinding suit
cæsar hath taught me better to refuse than i knew how to ask
how pleaseth cæsar embrace my late advice for leaving rome
here are some motives more gives him a paper
which i have thought on since may more confirm
we will straight peruse them go forward in our main design and prosper
if those but take i shall
wouldst thou tell me thy favours were made crimes and that my fortunes were esteem’d thy faults that thou for me wert hated and not think i would with winged haste prevent that change when thou might’st win all to thyself again by forfeiture of me
did those fond words fly swifter from thy lips than this my brain this sparkling forge created me an armour encounter chance and thee
well read my charms and may they lay that hold upon thy senses as thou hadst snuft up hemlock or ta’en down the juice of poppy and of mandrakes
sleep voluptuous cæsar and security seize on thy stupid powers and leave them dead to public cares awake but to thy lusts the strength of which makes thy libidinous soul itch to leave rome
and i have thrust it on with blaming of the city business the multitude of suits the confluence of suitors then their importunacies the manifold distractions he must suffer besides ill rumours envies and reproaches all which a quiet and retired life larded with ease and pleasure did avoid and yet for any weighty and great affair the fittest place to give the soundest counsels
by this i shall remove him both from thought and knowledge of his own most dear affairs draw all dispatches through my private hands know his designments and pursue mine own make mine own strengths by giving suits and places
conferring dignities and offices and these that hate me now wanting access to him will make their envy none or less for when they see me arbiter of all they must observe or else with cæsar fall
another room in the same
will no less sejanus content thy aim
thou know’st how thou art wrought into our trust woven in our design and think’st we must now use thee whatsoe’er thy projects are ’tis true
but yet with caution and fit care
and now we better thinkwho’s there within
to leave our journey off were sin ’gainst our decreed delights and would appear doubt or what less becomes a prince low fear
yet doubt hath law and fears have their excuse
where princes’ states plead necessary use as ours doth now more in sejanus’ pride than all fell agrippina’s hates beside
those are the dreadful enemies we raise with favours and make dangerous with praise the injured by us may have will alike but ’tis the favourite hath the power to strike and fury ever boils more high and strong heat with ambition than revenge of wrong
’tis then a part of supreme skill to grace no man too much but hold a certain space between the ascender’s rise and thine own flat lest when all rounds be reach’d his aim be that
is macro in the palace
see if not go seek him to come to us
he must be the organ we must work by now though none less apt for trust need doth allow what choice would not
i have heard that aconite being timely taken hath a healing might against the scorpion’s stroke the proof we’ll give that while two poisons wrestle we may live
he hath a spirit too working to be used but to the encounter of his like excused are wiser sov’reigns then that raise one ill against another and both safely kill the prince that feeds great natures they will slay him who nourisheth a lion must obey him
re enter officer with macro
macro we sent for you
i heard so cæsar
when you shall know
good macro the causes of our sending and the ends you will then hearken nearer and be pleas’d you stand so high both in our choice and trust
the humblest place in cæsar’s choice or trust may make glad macro proud without ambition
save to do cæsar service
we are in purpose macro to depart the city for a time and see campania not for our pleasures but to dedicate a pair of temples one to jupiter at capua th’ other at nola to augustus in which great work perhaps our stay will be beyond our will produced
now since we are not ignorant what danger may be born out of our shortest absence in a state so subject unto envy and embroil’d with hate and faction we have thought on thee amongst a field of romans worthiest macro to be our eye and ear to keep strict watch on agrippina nero drusus ay and on sejanus not that we distrust his loyalty or do repent one grace of all that heap we have conferred on him for that were to disparage our election and call that judgment now in doubt which then seem’d as unquestion’d as an oracle but greatness hath his cankers
worms and moths breed out of too much humour in the things which after they consume transferring quite the substance of their makers into themselves
macro is sharp and apprehends besides i know him subtle close wise and well read in man and his large nature he hath studied affections passions knows their springs their ends which way and whether they will work ’tis proof enough of his great merit that we trust him
then to a point because our conference cannot be long without suspicion here macro we assign thee both to spy inform and chastise think and use thy means thy ministers what where on whom thou wilt explore plot practise all thou dost in this shall be as if the senate or the laws had given it privilege and thou thence styled the saviour both of cæsar and of rome
we will not take thy answer but in act whereto as thou proceed’st we hope to hear by trusted messengers
if’t be inquired wherefore we call’d you say you have in charge to see our chariots ready and our horse
be still our loved and shortly honour’d macro
i will not ask why cæsar bids do this but joy that he bids me
it is the bliss of courts to be employ’d no matter how a prince’s power makes all his actions virtue
we whom he works by are dumb instruments to do but not inquire his great intents are to be served not search’d
yet as that bow is most in hand whose owner best doth know to affect his aims so let that statesman hope most use most price can hit his prince’s scope
nor must he look at what or whom to strike but loose at all each mark must be alike
were it to plot against the fame the life of one with whom i twinn’d remove a wife from my warm side as loved as is the air practise sway each parent draw mine heir in compass though but one work all my kin to swift perdition leave no untrain’d engine for friendship or for innocence nay make the gods all guilty i would undertake this being imposed me both with gain and ease the way to rise is to obey and please
he that will thrive in state he must neglect the trodden paths that truth and right respect and prove new wilder ways for virtue there is not that narrow thing she is elsewhere men’s fortune there is virtue reason their will their license law and their observance skill
occasion is their foil conscience their stain profit their lustre and what else is vain
if then it be the lust of cæsar’s power to have raised sejanus up and in an hour o’erturn him tumbling down from height of all we are his ready engine and his fall may be our rise
it is no uncouth thing to see fresh buildings from old ruins spring
an apartment in house
enter gallus and agrippina
you must have patience royal agrippina
i must have vengeance first and that were nectar unto my famish’d spirits
o my fortune let it be sudden thou prepar’st against me strike all my powers of understanding blind
and ignorant of destiny to come
let me not fear that cannot hope
dear princess these tyrannies on yourself are worse than cæsar’s
is this the happiness of being born great
still to be aim’d at
still to be suspected
to live the subject of all jealousies
at least the colour made if not the ground to every painted danger
who would not choose once to fall than thus to hang for ever
you might be safe if you would what my gallus
be lewd sejanus’ strumpet or the bawd to cæsar’s lusts he now is gone to practise
not these are safe where nothing is
yourself while thus you stand but by me are not safe
or the good sosia safe
or was my niece dear claudia pulchra safe or innocent furnius
they that latest have by being made guilty added reputation to afer’s eloquence
o foolish friends could not so fresh example warn your loves but you must buy my favours with that loss unto yourselves and when you might perceive that cæsar’s cause of raging must forsake him before his will
away good gallus leave me
here to be seen is danger to speak treason to do me least observance is call’d faction
you are unhappy in me and i in all
where are my sons nero and drusus
we are they be shot at let us fall apart not in our ruins sepulchre our friends
or shall we do some action like offence to mock their studies that would make us faulty and frustrate practice by preventing it
the danger’s like for what they can contrive they will make good
no innocence is safe when power contests nor can they trespass more whose only being was all crime before
enter nero drusus and caligula
you hear sejanus is come back from cæsar
more graced now than ever
a fortune like enough once to be bad
but turn’d too good to both
tiberius sitting at his meat in a farm house they call spelunca sited by the sea side among the fundane hills within a natural cave part of the grot about the entry fen and overwhelm’d some of the waiters others ran away only sejanus with his knees hands face o’erhanging cæsar did oppose himself to the remaining ruins and was found in that so labouring posture by the soldiers that came to succour him
with which adventure he hath so fix’d himself in cæsar’s trust as thunder cannot move him and is come with all the height of cæsar’s praise to rome
and power to turn those ruins all on us and bury whole posterities beneath them
nero and drusus and caligula your places are the next and therefore most in their offence
think on your birth and blood
awake your spirits meet their violence ’tis princely when a tyrant doth oppose and is a fortune sent to exercise your virtue as the wind doth try strong trees who by vexation grow more sound and firm
after your father’s fall and uncle’s fate what can you hope but all the change of stroke that force or sleight can give
then stand upright and though you do not act yet suffer nobly be worthy of my womb and take strong cheer what we do know will come we should not fear
renew’d in trust and grace
is cæsar then so weak or hath the place but wrought this alteration with the air and he on next remove will all repair
macro thou art engaged and what before was public now must be thy private more
the weal of cæsar fitness did imply but thine own fate confers necessity on thy employment and the thoughts born nearest unto ourselves move swiftest still and dearest
if he recover thou art lost yea all the weight of preparation to his fall will turn on thee and crush thee therefore strike before he settle to prevent the like upon thyself
he doth his vantage know that makes it home and gives the foremost blow
an upper room of enter latiaris rufus and opsius
it is a service lord sejanus will see well requited and accept of nobly
here place yourself between the roof and ceiling and when i bring him to his words of danger reveal yourselves and take him
i’ll now go fetch him
i long to merit from the state in such an action
i hope it will obtain the consulship for one of us
we cannot think of less to bring in one so dangerous as sabinus
he was follower of germanicus and still is an observer of his wife and children though they be declined in grace a daily visitant keeps them company in private and in public and is noted to be the only client of the house pray jove he will be free to latiaris
he’s allied to him and doth trust him well
and he’ll requite his trust
to do an office so grateful to the state i know no man but would strain nearer bands than kindred list
i hear them come
shift to our holes with silence
re enter latiaris and sabinus
it is a noble constancy you shew to this afflicted house that not like others the friends of season you do follow fortune and in the winter of their fate forsake the place whose glories warm’d you
you are just and worthy such a princely patron’s love as was the world’s renown’d germanicus whose ample merit when i call to thought and see his wife and issue objects made to so much envy jealousy and hate it makes me ready to accuse the gods of negligence as men of tyranny
they must be patient so must we
o jove what will become of us or of the times when to be high or noble are made crimes when land and treasure are most dangerous faults
nay when our table yea our bed assaults our peace and safety
when our writings are by any envious instruments that dare apply them to the guilty made to speak what they will have to fit their tyrannous wreak
when ignorance is scarcely innocence and knowledge made a capital offence
when not so much but the bare empty shade of liberty is raft us and we made the prey to greedy vultures and vile spies that first transfix us with their murdering eyes
methinks the genius of the roman race should not be so extinct but that bright flame of liberty might be revived again which no good man but
with his life should lose and we not sit like spent and patient fools still puffing in the dark at one poor coal held on by hope till the last spark is out
the cause is public and the honour name the immortality of every soul that is not bastard or a slave in rome therein concern’d whereto if men would change the wearied arm and for the weighty shield so long sustain’d employ the facile sword we might soon have assurance of our vows
this ass’s fortitude doth tire us all it must be active valour must redeem our loss or none
the rock and our hard steel should meet to enforce those glorious fires again whose splendour cheer’d the world and heat gave life no less than doth the sun’s
’twere better stay in lasting darkness and despair of day
no ill should force the subject undertake against the sovereign more than hell should make the gods do wrong
a good man should and must sit rather down with loss than rise unjust
though when the romans first did yield themselves to one man’s power they did not mean their lives their fortunes and their liberties should be his absolute spoil as purchased by the sword
why we are worse if to be slaves and bond to cæsar’s slave be such the proud sejanus
he that is all does all gives cæsar leave to hide his ulcerous and anointed face with his bald crown at rhodes while he here stalks upon the heads of romans and their princes familiarly to empire
now you touch a point indeed wherein he shews his art as well as power
and villainy in both
do you observe where livia lodges
how drusus came dead
what men have been cut off
yes those are things removed i nearer look’d into his later practice where he stands declared a master in his mystery
first ere tiberius went he wrought his fear to think that agrippina sought his death
then put those doubts in her sent her oft word
under the show of friendship to beware of cæsar for he laid to poison her drave them to frowns to mutual jealousies which now in visible hatred are burst out
since he hath had his hired instruments to work on nero and to heave him up to tell him cæsar’s old that all the people yea all the army have their eyes on him that both do long to have him undertake something of worth to give the world a hope bids him to court their grace the easy youth perhaps gives ear which straight he writes to cæsar and with this comment see yon dangerous boy note but the practice of the mother there she’s tying him for purposes at hand with men of sword
here’s cæsar put in fright ’gainst son and mother
yet he leaves not thus
the second brother drusus a fierce nature and fitter for his snares because ambitious and full of envy him he clasps and hugs poisons with praise tells him what hearts he wears how bright he stands in popular expectance that rome doth suffer with him in the wrong his mother does him by preferring nero thus sets he them asunder each ’gainst other projects the course that serves him to condemn keeps in opinion of a friend to all and all drives on to ruin
cæsar sleeps and nods at this
would he might ever sleep bogg’d in his filthy lusts
opsius and rufus rush in
lay hands upon the traitor latiaris or take the name thyself
i am for cæsar
am i then catch’d
how think you sir
spies of this head so white so full of years
well my most reverend monsters you may live to see yourselves thus snared
to be a spy for traitors is honourable vigilance
you do well my most officious instruments of state men of all uses drag me hence away
the year is well begun and i fall fit to be an offering to sejanus
cover him with his garments hide his face
it shall not need
forbear your rude assault
the fault’s not shameful villainy makes a fault
the street before house
enter macro and caligula
sir but observe how thick your dangers meet in his clear drifts
your mother and your brothers now cited to the senate their friend gallus feasted to day by cæsar since committed
sabinus here we met hurried to fetters the senators all strook with fear and silence save those whose hopes depend not on good means but force their private prey from public spoil
and you must know if here you stay your state is sure to be the subject of his hate as now the object
what would you advise me
to go for capreae presently and there give up yourself entirely to your uncle
tell cæsar since your mother is accused to fly for succours to augustus’ statue and to the army with your brethren you have rather chose to place your aids in him than live suspected or in hourly fear to be thrust out by bold sejanus’ plots which you shall confidently urge to be most full of peril to the state and cæsar as being laid to his peculiar ends and not to be let run with common safety
all which upon the second i’ll make plain so both shall love and trust with cæsar gain
away then let’s prepare us for our journey
another part of the street
still dost thou suffer heaven
will no flame no heat of sin make thy just wrath to boil in thy distemper’d bosom and o’erflow the pitchy blazes of impiety kindled beneath thy throne
still canst thou sleep patient while vice doth make an antick face at thy dread power and blow dust and smoke into thy nostrils
will nothing wake thee
must vile sejanus pull thee by the beard ere thou wilt open thy black lidded eye and look him dead
snore on dreaming gods and let this last of that proud giant race heave mountain upon mountain ’gainst your state be good unto me fortune and you powers whom i expostulating have profaned i see what’s equal with a prodigy a great a noble roman and an honest live an old man
o marcus lepidus when is our turn to bleed
thyself and i without our boast are almost all the few left to be honest in these impious times
what we are left to be we will be lucius though tyranny did stare as wide as death to fright us from it
hath so on sabinus
i saw him now drawn from the gemonies and what increased the direness of the fact his faithful dog upbraiding all us romans never forsook the corps but seeing it thrown into the stream leap’d in and drown’d with it
o act to be envied him of us men
we are the next the hook lays hold on marcus what are thy arts good patriot teach them me that have preserved thy hairs to this white dye and kept so reverend and so dear a head safe on his comely shoulders
none but the plain and passive fortitude to suffer and be silent never stretch these arms against the torrent live at home with my own thoughts and innocence about me not tempting the wolves’ jaws these are my arts
i would begin to study ’em if i thought they would secure me
may i pray to jove in secret and be safe
ay or aloud with open wishes so i do not mention tiberius or sejanus
yes i must if i speak out
may i think and not be rack’d
what danger is’t to dream talk in one’s sleep or cough
who knows the law
may i shake my head without a comment
say it rains or it holds up and not be thrown upon the gemonies
these now are things whereon men’s fortune yea their faith depends
nothing hath privilege ’gainst the violent ear
no place no day no hour we see is free not our religious and most sacred times from some one kind of cruelty all matter nay all occasion pleaseth
madmen’s rage the idleness of drunkards women’s nothing jester’s simplicity all all is good that can be catcht at
nor is now the event of any person or for any crime to be expected for ’tis always one death with some little difference of place or timewhat’s this
enter laco and nero with guards
on lictors keep your way
on pain of cæsar’s wrath no man attempt speech with the prisoner
noble friends be safe to lose yourselves for words were as vain hazard as unto me small comfort fare you well
would all rome’s sufferings in my fate did dwell
where goes he laco
sir he’s banish’d into pontia by the senate
do i see hear and feel
may i trust sense or doth my phant’sie form it
drusus is prisoner in the palace
i smell it now ’tis rank
the princess is confined to pandataria
bolts vulcan bolts for jove
phœbus thy bow stern mars thy sword and blue ey’d maid thy spear thy club alcides all the armoury of heaven is too little
to guard the gods i meant
fine rare dispatch i this same was swiftly born
the complement of all accusings
that will hit when all else fails
this turn is strange
but yesterday the people would not hear far less objected but cried cæsar’s letters were false and forged that all these plots were malice and that the ruin of the prince’s house was practised ’gainst his knowledge
where are now their voices now that they behold his heirs lock’d up disgraced led into exile
hush’d drown’d in their bellies
wild sejanus’ breath hath like a whirlwind scatter’d that poor dust with this rude blastwe’ll talk no treason sir turns to laco and the rest
if that be it you stand for
we have no need of horse leeches
good spy now you are spied be gone
exeunt laco nero and guards
i fear you wrong him he has the voice to be an honest roman
and trusted to this office
lepidus i’d sooner trust greek sinon than a man our state employs
he’s gone and being gone i dare tell you whom i dare better trust that our night eyed tiberius doth not see his minion’s drifts or if he do he’s not so arrant subtile as we fools do take him to breed a mungrel up in his own house with his own blood and if the good gods please at his own throat flesh him to take a leap
i do not beg it heaven but if the fates grant it these eyes they must not wink
they must not see it lucius
who should let them
zeal and duty with the thought he is our prince
he is our monster forfeited to vice so far as no rack’d virtue can redeem him
his loathed person fouler than all crimes an emperor only in his lusts
retired from all regard of his own fame or rome’s into an obscure island where he lives acting his tragedies with a comic face amidst his rout of chaldees spending hours days weeks and months in the unkind abuse of grave astrology to the bane of men casting the scope of men’s nativities and having found aught worthy in their fortune kill or precipitate them in the sea and boast he can mock fate
nay muse not these are far from ends of evil scarce degrees
he hath his slaughter house at capreae where he doth study murder as an art and they are dearest in his grace that can devise the deepest tortures
thither too he hath his boys and beauteous girls ta’en up out of our noblest houses the best form’d best nurtured and most modest what’s their good serves to provoke his bad
some are allured some threaten’d others by their friends detained are ravish’d hence like captives and in sight of their most grieved parents dealt away unto his spintries sellaries and slaves masters of strange and new commented lusts for which wise nature hath not left a name
to this what most strikes us and bleeding rome he is with all his craft become the ward to his own vassal a stale catamite whom he upon our low and suffering necks hath raised from excrement to side the gods and have his proper sacrifice in rome which jove beholds and yet will sooner rive a senseless oak with thunder than his trunk
re enter laco with pomponius and minutius
these letters make men doubtful what t’ expect whether his coming or his death
troth both and which comes soonest thank the gods for
their talk is cæsar i would hear all voices
arruntius and lepidus stand aside
one day he’s well and will return to rome the next day sick and knows not when to hope it
true and to day one of sejanus’ friends honour’d by special writ and on the morrow another punish’d by more special writ
this man receives his praises of sejanus a second but slight mention a third none a fourth rebukes and thus he leaves the senate divided and suspended all uncertain
these forked tricks i understand them not would he would tell us whom he loves or hates that we might follow without fear or doubt
is this your honest man
let him be yours so still he is my knave
i cannot tell sejanus still goes on and mounts we see new statues are advanced fresh leaves of titles large inscriptions read his fortune sworn by himself new gone out cæsar’s colleague in the fifth consulship more altars smoke to him than all the gods what would we more
that the dear smoke would choke him that would i more
but there are letters come they say ev’n now which do forbid that last
do you hear so
by castor that’s the worst
i did not like the sign when regulus whom all we know no friend unto sejanus did by tiberius’ so precise command succeed a fellow in the consulship it boded somewhat
his partner fulcinius trio is his own and sure
he can give us more
they whisper with terentius
i’ll ne’er believe but cæsar hath some scent of bold sejanus’ footing
these cross points of varying letters and opposing consuls mingling his honours and his punishments feigning now ill now well raising sejanus and then depressing him as now of late in all reports we have it cannot be empty of practice ’tis tiberius’ art
for having found his favourite grown too great and with his greatness strong that all the soldiers are with their leaders made a his devotion that almost all the senate are his creatures or hold on him their main dependencies either for benefit or hope or fear and that himself hath lost much of his own by parting unto him and by th’ increase of his rank lusts and rages quite disarm’d himself of love or other public means to dare an open contestation his subtilty hath chose this doubling line to hold him even in not so to fear him as wholly put him out and yet give check unto his farther boldness
in mean time by his employments makes him odious unto the staggering rout whose aid in fine he hopes to use as sure who when they sway
bear down o’erturn all objects in their way
you may be a lynceus lepidus yet i see no such cause but that a politic tyrant who can so well disguise it should have ta’en a nearer way feign’d honest and come home to cut his throat by law
ay but his fear would ne’er be mask’d allbe his vices were
his lordship then is still in grace
assure you never in more either of grace or power
the gods are wise and just
the fiends they are to suffer thee belie ’em
i have here his last and present letters where he writes him the partner of his cares and his sejanus
but is that true
it is prohibited to sacrifice unto him
some such thing cæsar makes scruple of but forbids it not no more than to himself says he could wish it were forborn to all
is it no other
no other on my trust
for your more surety here is that letter too
how easily do wretched men believe what they would have
looks this like plot
he names him here without his titles
yes and come off your notable fool
i will no other than sejanus
that’s but haste in him that writes here he gives large amends
and with his own hand written
believe it gentlemen sejanus’ breast never received more full contentments in than at this present
takes he well the escape of young caligula with macro
faith at the first air it somewhat troubled him
till i see sejanus struck no sound thereof strikes me
exeunt arruntius and lepidus
i like it not
i muse he would not attempt somewhat against him in the consulship seeing the people ’gin to favour him
he doth repent it now but he has employ’d pagonianus after him and he holds that correspondence there with all that are near about cæsar as no thought can pass without his knowledge thence in act to front him
i gratulate the news
but how comes macro so in trust and favour with caligula
o sir he has a wife and the young prince an appetite he can look up and spy flies in the roof when there are fleas i’ the bed and hath a learned nose to assure his sleeps
who to be favour’d of the rising sun would not lend little of his waning moon
it is the saf’st ambition
the night grows fast upon us
an apartment in house
swell swell my joys and faint not to declare yourselves as ample as your causes are
i did not live till now this my first hour wherein i see my thoughts reach’d by my power
but this and gripe my wishes
great and high the world knows only two that’s rome and my roof receives me not ’tis air i tread and at each step i feel my advanced head knock out a star in heaven
rear’d to this height all my desires seem modest poor and slight that did before sound impudent ’tis place not blood discerns the noble and the base
is there not something more than to be cæsar
must we rest there
it irks t’ have come so far to be so near a stay
caligula would thou stood’st stiff and many in our way
winds lose their strength when they do empty fly unmet of woods or buildings great fires die that want their matter to withstand them so it is our grief and will be our loss to know our power shall want opposites unless the gods by mixing in the cause would bless our fortune with their conquest
that were worth sejanus’ strife durst fates but bring it forth
safety to great sejanus
hears not my lord the wonder
i meet it violent in the people’s mouths who run in routs to pompey’s theatre to view your statue which they say sends forth a smoke as from a furnace black and dreadful
some traitor hath put fire in you go see and let the head be taken off to look what ’tis
some slave hath practised an imposture to stir the people
re enter terentius with satrius and natta
the head my lord already is ta’en off i saw it and at opening there leapt out a great and monstrous serpent
had it a beard and horns
a tongue forked as flattery
look’d it of the hue to such as live in great men’s bosoms
was the spirit of it macro’s
may it please the most divine sejanus in my days and by his sacred fortune i affirm it i have not seen a more extended grown foul spotted venomous ugly o the fates
what a wild muster’s here of attributes express a worm a snake
but how that should come there my lord
what and you too terentius
i think you mean to make ’t a prodigy in your reporting
can the wise sejanus think heaven hath meant it less
why then the falling of our bed that brake this morning burden’d with the populous weight of our expecting clients to salute us or running of the cat betwixt our legs as we set forth unto the capitol were prodigies
i think them ominous and would they had not happened
as to day the fate of some your servants who declining their way not able for the throng to follow slipt down the gemonies and brake their necks
besides in taking your last augury no prosperous bird appear’d but croaking ravens flagg’d up and down and from the sacrifice flew to the prison where they sat all night beating the air with their obstreperous beaks
i dare not counsel but i could entreat that great sejanus would attempt the gods once more with sacrifice
what excellent fools religion makes of men
believes terentius if these were dangers as i shame to think them the gods could change the certain course of fate
or if they could they would now in a moment for a beeve’s fat or less be bribed to invert those long decrees
then think the gods like flies are to be taken with the steam of flesh or blood diffused about their altars think their power as cheap as i esteem it small
of all the throng that fill th’ olympian hall and without pity lade poor atlas’ back i know not that one deity but fortune to whom i would throw up in begging smoke one grain of incense or whose ear i’d buy with thus much oil
her i indeed adore and keep her grateful image in my house sometime belonging to a roman king
but now call’d mine as by the better style to her i care not if for satisfying your scrupulous phant’sies i go offer
bid our priest prepare us honey milk and poppy his masculine odours and night vestments say our rites are instant which perform’d you’ll see how vain and worthy laughter your fears be
another room in the same
enter cotta and pomponius
pomponius whither in such speed
i go to give my lord sejanus notice what
enter’d but now the house of regulus the opposite consul
some half hour since
and by night too
stay sir i’ll bear you company
enter macro regulus and attendant
tis cæsar’s will to have a frequent senate and therefore must your edict lay deep mulct on such as shall be absent
bear it my fellow consul to adscribe
and tell him it must early be proclaim’d the place apollo’s temple
and at what hour
you do forget to send one for the provost of the watch
i have not here he comes
gracinus laco you are a friend most welcome by and by i’ll speak with you
you must procure this list of the prætorian cohorts with the names of the centurions and their tribunes
i bring you letters and a health from cæsar sir both come well
with your note which are the eminent men and most of action
that shall be done you too
most worthy laco cæsar salutes you
the argument will please you sir
the anger of the gods follow your diligent legs and overtake ’em in likeness of the gout
o my good lord we lack’d you present i would pray you send another to fulcinius trio straight to tell him you will come and speak with him the matter we’ll devise to stay him there while i with laco do survey the watch
what are your strengths gracinus
you see what cæsar writes andgone again
has sure a vein of mercury in his feet
know you what store of the prætorian soldiers sejanus holds about him for his guard
i cannot the just number but i think three centuries
at most not four
and who be those centurions
that the consul can best deliver you
spite on his nimble industrygracinus you find what place you hold
there in the trust of royal cæsar
ay and i am sir the honours there proposed are but beginnings of his great favours
they are more i heard him when he did study what to add
my life and all i hold you were his own first choice which doth confirm as much as you can speak and will if we succeed make moreyour guards are seven cohorts you say
those we must hold still in readiness and undischarged
i understand so much
but how it can be done without suspicion you’ll object
the keeping of the watch in arms when morning comes
the senate shall be met and set so early in the temple as all mark of that shall be avoided
if we need we have commission to possess the palace enlarge prince drusus and make him our chief
that secret would have burnt his reverend mouth had he not spit it out now by the gods you carry things toolet me borrow a man or two to bear thesethat of freeing drusus cæsar projected as the last and utmost not else to be remember’d

if they demand you of me say i have ta’en fresh horse and am departed
you my lord to your colleague and be you sure to hold him with long narration of the new fresh favours meant to sejanus his great patron i with trusted laco here are for the guards then to divide

accept our offering and be pleased great goddess
see see the image stirs
fortune averts her face
avert you gods the prodigy
still some pious rite we have neglected
yet heaven be appeased and be all tokens false and void that speak thy present wrath
be thou dumb scrupulous priest and gather up thyself with these thy wares which i in spite of thy blind mistress or thy juggling mystery religion throw thus scorned on the earth
overturns the statue and the altar
nay hold thy look averted till i woo thee turn again and thou shalt stand to all posterity the eternal game and laughter with thy neck writh’d to thy tail like a ridiculous cat
avoid these fumes these superstitious lights and all these cozening ceremonies you your pure and spiced conscience
exeunt all but sejanus terentius satrius and natta
i the slave and mock of fools scorn on my worthy head
that have been titled and adored a god yea sacrificed unto myself in rome no less than jove and i be brought to do a peevish giglot rites
perhaps the thought and shame of that made fortune turn her face knowing herself the lesser deity and but my servant
bashful queen if so sejanus thanks thy modesty
enter pomponius and minutius
his fortune suffers till he hears my news i have waited here too long
macro my lord speak lower and withdraw
are these things true
thousands are gazing at it in the streets
minutius tells us here my lord that a new head being set upon your statue a rope is since found wreath’d about it
and but now a fiery meteor in the form of a great ball was seen to roll along the troubled air where yet it hangs unperfect the amazing wonder of the multitude
that macro’s come is more than all
send for the tribunes we will straight have up more of the soldiers for our guard
minutius we pray you go for cotta latiaris trio the consul or what senators you know are sure and ours
you my good natta for laco provost of the watch
now satrius the time of proof comes on arm all our servants and without tumult
you pomponius hold some good correspondence with the consul attempt him noble friend
these things begin to look like dangers now worthy my fates
fortune i see thy worst let doubtful states and things uncertain hang upon thy will me surest death shall render certain still
yet why is now my thought turn’d toward death whom fates have let go on so far in breath uncheck’d or unreproved
i that did help to fell the lofty cedar of the world germanicus that at one stroke cut down drusus that upright elm wither’d his vine laid silius and sabinus two strong oaks flat on the earth besides those other shrubs cordus and sosia claudia pulchra furnius and gallus which i have grubb’d up and since have set my axe so strong and deep into the root of spreading agrippina lopt off and scatter’d her proud branches nero
drusus and caius too although re planted
if you will destinies that after all i faint now ere i touch my period you are but cruel and i already have done things great enough
all rome hath been my slave the senate sate an idle looker on and witness of my power when i have blush’d more to command than it to suffer all the fathers have sate ready and prepared
to give me empire temples or their throats
when i would ask ’em and what crowns the top rome senate people all the world have seen jove but my equal cæsar but my second
’tis then your malice fates who but your own envy and fear to have any power long known
room in the same
enter terentius and tribunes
stay here i’ll give his lordship you are come
enter minutius with cotta and latiaris
marcus terentius pray you tell my lord here’s cotta and latiaris
my letter is the very same with yours only requires me to be present there and give my voice to strengthen his design
names he not what it is
no nor to you
’tis strange and singular doubtful
it may be all is left to lord sejanus
enter natta and gracinus laco
gentlemen where’s my lord
we wait him here
my lord enter sejanus
now my right dear noble and trusted friends how much i am a captive to your kindness
most worthy cotta latiaris laco your valiant hand and gentlemen your loves
i wish i could divide myself unto you or that it lay within our narrow powers to satisfy for so enlarged bounty
gracinus we must pray you hold your guards unquit when morning comes
saw you the consul
trio will presently be here my lord
they are but giving order for the edict to warn the senate
this morning in apollo’s temple
we are charged by letter to be there my lord
pray you let’s see
knows not his lordship
and on this sudden
senators by letters required to be there
time with every other circumstance doth give it hath some strain of engine in’t
my lord sertorius macro is without alone and prays t’ have private conference in business of high nature with your lordship he says to me and which regards you much
let him come here
better my lord withdraw you will betray what store and strength of friends are now about you which he comes to spy
is he not arm’d
no but take and lead him to some room where you conceal’d may keep a guard upon us
noble laco you are our trust and till our own cohorts can be brought up your strengths must be our guard
now good minutius honour’d latiaris he salutes them humbly
most worthy and my most unwearied friends i return instantly
his lordship is turn’d instant kind methinks i have not observed it in him heretofore
’tis true and it becomes him nobly
i am wrapt withal
by mars he has my lives were they a million for this only grace
ay and to name a man
as he did me
who would not spend his life and fortunes to purchase but the look of such a lord
he that would nor be lord’s fool nor the world’s
another room in the same
enter sejanus macro and satrius
most welcome a most coveted friend
let me enjoy my longings
about the noon of night
i have been since i came with both the consuls on a particular design from cæsar
how fares it with our great and royal master
right plentifully well as with a prince that still holds out the great proportion of his large favours where his judgment hath made once divine election like the god that wants not nor is wearied to bestow where merit meets his bounty as it doth in you already the most happy and ere the sun shall climb the south most high sejanus
let not my lord be amused
for to this end was i by cæsar sent for to the isle with special caution to conceal my journey and thence had my dispatch as privately again to rome charged to come here by night and only to the consuls make narration of his great purpose that the benefit might come more full and striking by how much it was less look’d for or aspired by you or least informed to the common thought
what may be this
part of myself dear macro if good speak out and share with your sejanus
if bad i should for ever loath myself to be the messenger to so good a lord
i do exceed my instructions to acquaint your lordship with thus much but ’tis my venture on your retentive wisdom and because i would no jealous scruple should molest or rack your peace of thought
for i assure my noble lord no senator yet knows the business meant though all by several letters are warned to be there and give their voices only to add unto the state and grace of what is purposed
you take pleasure macro like a coy wench in torturing your lover
what can be worth this suffering
that which follows the tribunitial dignity and power both which sejanus is to have this day conferr’d upon him and by public senate
fortune be mine again
thou hast satisfied for thy suspected loyalty
my lord i have no longer time the day approacheth and i must back to cæsar
that i forgot to tell your lordship
why he lingers yonder about capreae disgraced tiberius hath not seen him yet he needs would thrust himself to go with me against my wish or will but i have quitted his forward trouble with as tardy note as my neglect or silence could afford him
your lordship cannot now command me aught because i take no knowledge that i saw you but i shall boast to live to serve your lordship and so take leave
honest and worthy macro your love and friendship
satrius attend my honourable friend forth
how vain and vile a passion is this fear what base uncomely things it makes men do
suspect their noblest friends as i did this flatter poor enemies entreat their servants stoop court and catch at the benevolence of creatures unto whom within this hour i would not have vouchsafed a quarter look or piece of face
by you that fools call gods hang all the sky with your prodigious signs fill earth with monsters drop the scorpion down out of the zodiac or the fiercer lion shake off the loosen’d globe from her long hinge roll all the world in darkness and let loose the enraged winds to turn up groves and towns
when i do fear again let me be struck with forked fire and unpitied die who fears is worthy of calamity
another room in the same
enter terentius minutius laco cotta latiaris and pomponius regulus trio and others on different sides
is not my lord here
sir he will be straight
what news fulcinius trio
good good tidings but keep it to yourself
my lord sejanus is to receive this day in open senate the tribunitial dignity
no words not to your thought but sir believe it
what says the consul
speak it not again he tells me that to day my lord sejanus i must entreat you cotta on your honour not to reveal it
on my life sir
is to receive the tribunitial power
but as you are an honourable man let me conjure you not to utter it for it is trusted to me with that bond
can you assure it
the consul told it me but keep it close
lord latiaris what’s the news
i’ll tell you but you must swear to keep it secret
i knew the fates had on their distaff left more of our thread than so
hail the most honour’d
do you bring prodigies too
may all presage turn to those fair effects whereof we bring your lordship news
may’t please my lord withdraw
yesi will speak with you anon
to some that stand by
my lord what is your pleasure for the tribunes
why let them be thank’d and sent away
my lord will’t please your lordship to command me no you are troublesome
the mood is changed
not speak nor look
ay he is wise will make him friends of such who never love but for their ends
space before the temple of apollo
enter arruntius and lepidus divers senators passing by them
ay go make haste take heed you be not last to tender your all hail in the wide hall of huge sejanus run a lictor’s pace stay not to put your robes on but away with the pale troubled ensigns of great friendship stamp’d in your face
now marcus lepidus you still believe your former augury
sejanus must go downward
you perceive his wane approaching fast
believe me lucius i wonder at this rising
ay and that we must give our suffrage to it
you will say it is to make his fall more steep and grievous it may be so
but think it they that can with idle wishes ’say to bring back time in cases desperate all hope is crime
what troops of his officious friends flock to salute my lord and start before my great proud lord
to get a lord like nod
attend my lord unto the senate house
bring back my lord
like servile ushers make way for my lord
proclaim his idol lordship more than ten criers or six noise of trumpets
make legs kiss hands and take a scatter’d hair from my lord’s eminent shoulder
sanquinius and haterius pass over the stage
see sanquinius with his slow belly and his dropsy
look what toiling haste he makes
yet here’s another retarded with the gout will be afore him
get thee liburnian porters thou gross fool to bear thy obsequious fatness like thy peers
the gout returns and his great carriage
lictors regulus trio sejanus satrius and many other senators pass over the stage
give way make place room for the consul
hail hail great sejanus
hail my honour’d lord
we shall be mark’d anon for our not hail
that is already done
it is a note of upstart greatness to observe and watch for these poor trifles which the noble mind neglects and scorns
ay and they think themselves deeply dishonour’d where they are omitted as if they were necessities that help’d to the perfection of their dignities and hate the men that but refrain them
there is a farther cause of hate
their breasts are guilty that we know their obscure springs and base beginnings thence the anger grows
another part of the same
enter macro and laco
when all are enter’d shut the temple doors and bring your guards up to the gate
if you shall hear commotion in the senate present yourself and charge on any man shall offer to come forth
the temple of apollo
enter haterius trio sanquinius cotta regulus sejanus pomponius latiaris lepidus arruntius and divers other senators præcones and lictors
how well his lordship looks to day
as if he had been born or made for this hour’s state
your fellow consul’s come about methinks
ay he is wise
sejanus trusts him well
sejanus is a noble bounteous lord
he is so and most valiant
worthy of all and more than bounty can bestow
this dignity will make him worthy
tut cæsar is but the rector of an isle he of the empire
now he will have power more to reward than ever
let us look we be not slack in giving him our voices
not nor the readier we seem to propagate his honours will more bind his thoughts to ours
i think right with your lordship it is the way to have us hold our places
ay and get more
more office and more titles
i will not lose the part i hope to share i n these his fortunes for my patrimony
see how arruntius sits and lepidus
let them alone they will be mark’d anon
i’ll do with others
so will and men grow not in the state but as they are planted warm in his favours
worthy and great sejanus
how the sponges open and take in and shut again
is not he blest that gets a seat in eye reach of him
more that comes in ear or tongue reach
o but most can claw his subtle elbow or with a buz fly blow his ears
proclaim the senate’s peace and give last summons by the edict
in name of cæsar and the senate silence
memmius regulus and fulcinius trio consuls these present kalends of june with the first light shall hold a senate in the temple of apollo palatine all that are fathers and are registered fathers that have right of entering the senate we warn or command you be frequently present take knowledge the business is the commonwealth’s whosoever is absent his fine or mulct will be taken his excuse will not be taken
note who are absent and record their names
fathers conscript may what i am to utter turn good and happy for the commonwealth
and thou apollo in whose holy house we here have met inspire us all with truth and liberty of censure to our thought
the majesty of great tiberius cæsar propounds to this grave senate the bestowing upon the man he loves honour’d sejanus the tribunitial dignity and power here are his letters signed with his signet
what pleaseth now the fathers to be done
read read them open publicly read them
cæsar hath honour’d his own greatness much in thinking of this act
it was a thought happy and worthy cæsar
and the lord as worthy it on whom it is directed
rome did never boast the virtue that could give envy bounds but his sejanus honour’d and noble
good and great sejanus
o most tame slavery and fierce flattery
to the senate greeting
if you conscript fathers with your children be in health it is abundantly well we with our friends here are so
the care of the commonwealth howsoever we are removed in person cannot be absent to our thought although oftentimes even to princes most present the truth of their own affairs is hid than which nothing falls out more miserable to a state or makes the art of governing more difficult
but since it hath been our easeful happiness to enjoy both the aids and industry of so vigilant a senate we profess to have been the more indulgent to our pleasures not as being careless of our office but rather secure of the necessity
neither do these common rumours of many and infamous libels published against our retirement at all afflict us being born more out of men’s ignorance than their malice and will neglected find their own grave quickly whereas too sensibly acknowledged it would make their obloquy ours
nor do we desire their authors though found be censured since in a free state as ours all men ought to enjoy both their minds and tongues free
the lapwing the lapwing
yet in things which shall worthily and more near concern the majesty of a prince we shall fear to be so unnaturally cruel to our own fame as to neglect them
true it is conscript fathers that we have raised sejanus from obscure and almost unknown gentry how how
to the highest and most conspicuous point of greatness and we hope deservingly yet not without danger it being a most bold hazard in that sovereign who by his particular love to one dares adventure the hatred of all his other subjects
this touches the blood turns
but we affy in your loves and understandings and do no way suspect the merit of our sejanus to make our favours offensive to any
though we could have wished his zeal had run a calmer course against agrippina and our nephews howsoever the openness of their actions declared them delinquents and that he would have remembered no innocence is so safe but it rejoiceth to stand in the sight of mercy the use of which in us he hath so quite taken away towards them by his loyal fury as now our clemency would be thought but wearied cruelty if we should offer to exercise it
i thank him there i look’d for’t
some there be that would interpret this his public severity to be particular ambition and that under a pretext of service to us he doth but remove his own lets alleging the strengths he hath made to himself by the prætorian soldiers by his faction in court and senate by the offices he holds himself and confers on others his popularity and dependents his urging and almost driving us to this our unwilling retirement and lastly his aspiring to be our son in law
i shall anon believe your vultures marcus
your wisdoms conscript fathers are able to examine and censure these suggestions
but were they left to our absolving voice we durst pronounce them as we think them most malicious
o he has restored all list
yet are they offered to be averred and on the lives of the informers
what we should say or rather what we should not say lords of the senate if this be true our gods and goddesses confound us if we know
only we must think we have placed our benefits ill and conclude that in our choice either we were wanting to the gods or the gods to us
the senators shift their places
the place grows hot they shift
we have not been covetous honourable fathers to change neither is it now any new lust that alters our affection or old loathing but those needful jealousies of state that warn wiser princes hourly to provide their safety and do teach them how learned a thing it is to beware of the humblest enemy much more of those great ones whom their own employed favours have made fit for their fears
how the leaves drop off this little wind
we therefore desire that the offices he holds be first seized by the senate and himself suspended from all exercise of place or power how
come porpoise where’s haterius
his gout keeps him most miserably constant your dancing shews a tempest
lords of the senate hold your seats read on
these letters they are forged
enter laco with the guards
bid silence and read forward
and himself suspended from all exercise of place or power but till due and mature trial be made of his innocency which yet we can faintly apprehend the necessity to doubt
if conscript fathers to your more searching wisdoms there shall appear farther causeor of farther proceeding either to seizure of lands goods or moreit is not our power that shall limit your authority or our favour that must corrupt your justice either were dishonourable in you and both uncharitable to ourself
we would willingly be present with your counsels in this business but the danger of so potent a faction if it should prove so forbids our attempting it except one of the consuls would be entreated for our safety to undertake the guard of us home then we should most readily adventure
in the mean time it shall not be fit for us to importune so judicious a senate who know how much they hurt the innocent that spare the guilty and how grateful a sacrifice to the gods is the life of an ingrateful person we reflect not in this on sejanus notwithstanding if you keep an eye upon him and there is latiaris a senator and pinnarius natta two of his most trusted ministers and so professed whom we desire not to have apprehended but as the necessity of the cause exacts it
a guard on latiaris
o the spy the reverend spy is caught
reward sir for your service now you have done your property you see what use is made
exeunt latiaris and natta guarded
hang up the instrument
he comes upon his death that doth advance an inch toward my point
have we no friends here
where now are all the hails and acclamations
hail to the consuls and this noble senate
o thou art lost sejanus
sit still and unaffrighted reverend fathers macro by cæsar’s grace the new made provost and now possest of the prætorian bands an honour late belong’d to that proud man bids you be safe and to your constant doom of his deservings offers you the surety of all the soldiers tribunes and centurions received in our command
sejanus sejanus stand forth sejanus
ay thou thou insolent monster art bid stand
it hath been otherwise between you and i this court that knows us both hath seen a difference and can if it be pleased to speak confirm whose insolence is most
if mine be most lo
thus i make it more kick up thy heels in air tear off thy robe play with thy beard and nostrils
thus ’tis fit and no man take compassion of thy state to use th’ ingrateful viper tread his brains into the earth
if i could lose all my humanity now ’twere well to torture so meriting a traitor
wherefore fathers sit you amazed and silent and not censure this wretch who in the hour he first rebell’d ’gainst cæsar’s bounty did condemn himself
phlegra the field where all the sons of earth muster’d against the gods did ne’er acknowledge so proud and huge a monster
take him hence and all the gods guard cæsar
to the dungeon with him
crown all our doors with bays
and let an ox with gilded horns and garlands straight be led unto the capitol and sacrificed to jove for cæsar’s safety
all our gods be present still to cæsar
juno mercury all guard him
forth thou prodigy of men
let all the traitor’s titles be defaced
his images and statues be pull’d down
his chariot wheels be broken
and the legs of the poor horses that deseryed nought let them be broken too
exeunt lictors præcones macro regulus trio haterius and sanquinius manent lepidus arruntius and a few senators
o violent change and whirl of men’s affections
like as both their bulks and souls were bound on fortune’s wheel and must act only with her motion
who would depend upon the popular air or voice of men that have to day beheld that which if all the gods had fore declared would not have been believed sejanus’ fall
he that this morn rose proudly as the sun and breaking through a mist of clients’ breath came on as gazed at and admired as he when superstitious moors salute his light
that had our servile nobles waiting him as common grooms and hanging on his look no less than human life on destiny
that had men’s knees as frequent as the gods and sacrifices more than rome had altars and this man fall
ay without a look that durst appear his friend or lend so much of vain relief to his changed state as pity
they that before like gnats play’d in his beams and throng’d to circumscribe him now not seen nor deign to hold a common seat with him
others that waited him unto the senate now inhumanely ravish him to prison whom but this morn they follow’d as their lord
guard through the streets bound like a fugitive instead of wreaths give fetters strokes for stoops blind shames for honours and black taunts for titles
who would trust slippery chance
they that would make themselves her spoil and foolishly forget when she doth flatter that she comes to prey
fortune thou hadst no deity if men had wisdom we have placed thee so high by fond belief in thy felicity
the gods guard cæsar
all the gods guard cæsar
re enter macro regulus and divers senators
now great sejanus you that awed the state and sought to bring the nobles to your whip that would be cæsar’s tutor and dispose of dignities and offices
that had the public head still bare to your designs and made the general voice to echo yours
that look’d for salutations twelve score off and would have pyramids yea temples rear’d to your huge greatness now you lie as flat as was your pride advanced
thanks to the gods
and praise to macro that hath saved rome
lead on and praise to macro that hath saved rome
exeunt all but arruntius and lepidus
i prophesy out of the senate’s flattery that this new fellow macro will become a greater prodigy in rome than he that now is fallen
o you whose minds are good and have not forced all mankind from your breasts that yet have so much stock of virtue left to pity guilty states when they are wretched lend your soft ears to hear and eyes to weep deeds done by men beyond the acts of furies
the eager multitude who never yet knew why to love or hate but only pleased express their rage of power no sooner heard the murmur of sejanus in decline but with that speed and heat of appetite with which they greedily devour the way to some great sports or a new theatre they fill’d the capitol and pompey’s cirque where like so many mastiffs biting stones as if his statues now were sensitive of their wild fury first they tear them down then fastening ropes drag them along the streets crying in scorn this this was that rich head was crown’d with garlands and with odours this that was in rome so reverenced
now the furnace and the bellows shall to work the great sejanus crack and piece by piece drop in the founder’s pit
the whilst the senate at the temple of concord make haste to meet again and thronging cry let us condemn him tread him down in water while he doth lie upon the bank away
while some more tardy cry unto their bearers he will be censured ere we come run knaves and use that furious diligence for fear their bondmen should inform against their slackness and bring their quaking flesh unto the hook the rout they follow with confused voice crying they’re glad say they could ne’er abide him enquire what man he was what kind of face what beard he had what nose what lips
protest they ever did presage he’d come to this they never thought him wise nor valiant ask after his garments when he dies what death and not a beast of all the herd demands what was his crime or who were his accusers under what proof or testimony he fell
there came says one a huge long worded letter from capreae against him
o they are satisfied no more
they follow fortune and hate men condemn’d guilty or not
but had sejanus thrived in his design and prosperously opprest the old tiberius then in that same minute these very rascals that now rage like furies would have proclaim’d sejanus emperor
but what hath follow’d
sentence by the senate to lose his head which was no sooner off but that and the unfortunate trunk were seized by the rude multitude who not content with what the forward justice of the state
officiously had done with violent rage have rent it limb from limb
a thousand heads a thousand hands ten thousand tongues and voices employ’d at once in several acts of malice
old men not staid with age virgins with shame late wives with loss of husbands mothers of children losing all grief in joy of his sad fall run quite transported with their cruelty
these mounting at his head these at his face these digging out his eyes those with his brains sprinkling themselves their houses and their friends others are met have ravish’d thence an arm and deal small pieces of the flesh for favours these with a thigh this hath cut off his hands and this his feet these fingers and these toes that hath his liver he his heart there wants nothing but room for wrath and place for hatred
what cannot oft be done is now o’erdone
the whole and all of what was great sejanus and next to cæsar did possess the world now torn and scatter’d as he needs no grave each little dust covers a little part so lies he no where and yet often buried
what can be added
we know him dead
then there begin your pity
there is enough behind to melt ev’n rome and cæsar into tears since never slave could yet so highly offend but tyranny in torturing him would make him worth lamenting
a son and daughter to the dead sejanus of whom there is not now so much remaining as would give fast’ning to the hangman’s hook have they drawn forth for farther sacrifice whose tenderness of knowledge unripe years and childish silly innocence was such as scarce would lend them feeling of their danger the girl so simple as she often ask’d where they would lead her
for what cause they dragg’d her
cried she would do no more that she could take warning with beating
and because our laws admit no virgin immature to die the wittily and strangely cruel macro deliver’d her to be deflower’d and spoil’d by the rude lust of the licentious hangman then to be strangled with her harmless brother
o act most worthy hell and lasting night to hide it from the world
their bodies thrown into the gemonies i know not how or by what accident return’d
the mother the expulsed apicata finds them there whom when she saw lie spread on the degrees after a world of fury on herself tearing her hair defacing of her face beating her breasts and womb kneeling amaz’d crying to heaven then to them at last her drowned voice gat up above her woes and with such black and bitter execrations as might affright the gods and force the sun run backward to the east nay make the old deformed chaos rise again to o’erwhelm them us and all the world she fills the air upbraids the heavens with their partial dooms defies their tyrannous powers and demands what she and those poor innocents have transgress’d that they must suffer such a share in vengeance whilst livia lygdus and eudemus live who as she says and firmly vows to prove it to cæsar and the senate poison’d drusus
confederates with her husband
and strangely open’d what says now my monster the multitude
they reel now do they not
their gall is gone and now they ’gin to weep the mischief they have done
i thank ’em rogues
part are so stupid or so flexible as they believe him innocent all grieve and some whose hands yet reek with his warm blood and gripe the part which they did tear of him wish him collected and created new
how fortune plies her sports when she begins to practise them
pursues continues adds confounds with varying her impassion’d moods
dost thou hope fortune to redeem thy crimes to make amend for thy ill placed favours with these strange punishments
forbear you things that stand upon the pinnacles of state to boast your slippery height when you do fall you pash yourselves in pieces ne’er to rise and he that lends you pity is not wise
let this example move the insolent man not to grow proud and careless of the gods
it is an odious wisdom to blaspheme much more to slighten or deny their powers for whom the morning saw so great and high thus low and little fore the even doth lie
