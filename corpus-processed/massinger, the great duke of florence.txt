a room in charomonte's house
you bring your welcome with you
sir i find it in every circumstance
yet give me leave to wish and pray you excuse me for i must use the freedom i was born with the great duke's pleasure had commanded you to my poor house upon some other service not this you are design'd to but his will must be obey'd howe'er it ravish from me the happy conversation of one as dear to me as the old romans held their household lars whom they believed had power to bless and guard their families
'tis received so on my part signior nor can the duke but promise to himself as much as may be hoped for from a nephew
and 'twere weakness in any man to doubt that giovanni train'd up by your experience and care in all those arts peculiar and proper to future greatness of necessity must in his actions being grown a man make good the princely education which he derived from you
i have discharged to the utmost of my power the trust the duke committed to me and with joy perceive the seed of my endeavours was not sown upon the barren sands but fruitful glebe which yields a large increase my noble charge by his sharp wit and pregnant apprehension instructing those that teach him making use not in a vulgar and pedantic form of what's read to him but 'tis straight digested and truly made his own
his grave discourse in one no more indebted unto years amazes such as hear him horsemanship and skill to use his weapon are by practice familiar to him as for knowledge in music he needs it not it being born with him all that he speaks being with such grace deliver'd that it makes perfect harmony
you describe a wonder to me
sir he is no less and that there may be nothing wanting that may render him complete the sweetness of his disposition so wins on all appointed to attend him that they are rivals even in the coarsest office who shall get precedency to do him service which they esteem a greater happiness than if they had been fashion'd and built up to hold command o'er others
and what place does he now bless with his presence
he is now running at the ring at which he's excellent
he does allot for every exercise a several hour for sloth the nurse of vices and rust of action is a stranger to him
but i fear i am tedious let us pass if you please to some other subject though i cannot deliver him as he deserves
you have given him a noble character
and how i pray you for we that never look beyond our villas must be inquisitive are state affairs carried in court
there's little alteration some rise and others fall as it stands with the pleasure of the duke their great disposer
does lodovico sanazarro hold weight and grace with him
every day new honours are shower'd upon him and without the envy of such as are good men since all confess the service done our master in his wars 'gainst pisa and sienna may with justice claim what's conferr'd upon him
'tis said nobly for princes never more make known their wisdom than when they cherish goodness where they find it they being men and not gods contarino they can give wealth and titles but no virtues that is without their power
when they advance not out of judgment but deceiving fancy an undeserving man howe'er set off with all the trim of greatness state and power and of a creature even grown terrible to him from whom he took his giant form this thing is still a comet no true star and when the bounties feeding his false fire begin to fail will of itself go out and what was dreadful proves ridiculous
but in our sanazarro 'tis not so he being pure and tried gold and any stamp of grace to make him current to the world the duke is pleased to give him will add honour to the great bestower for he though allow'd companion to his master still preserves his majesty in full lustre
he indeed at no part does take from it but becomes a partner of his cares and eases him with willing shoulders of a burden which he should alone sustain
is he yet married
no signior still a bachelor howe'er it is apparent that the choicest virgin for beauty bravery and wealth in florence would with her parents' glad consent be won were his affection and intent but known to be at his devotion
so i think too
but break we off here comes my princely charge
enter and make your approaches boldly you will find a courteous entertainment
pray you forbear my hand good signior 'tis a ceremony not due to me
'tis fit we should embrace with mutual arms
it is a favour sir i grieve to be denied
you shall o'ercome but 'tis your pleasure not my pride that grants it
nay pray you guardian and good sir put on how ill it shows to have that reverend head uncover'd to a boy
your excellence must give me liberty to observe the distance and duty that i owe you
i do profess and when i do deny it good fortune leave me
you have been to me a second father and may justly challenge for training up my youth in arts and arms as much respect and service as was due to him that gave me life
and did you know sir or will believe from me how many sleeps good charomonte hath broken in his care to build me up a man you must confess chiron the tutor to the great achilles compared with him deserves not to be named
and if my gracious uncle the great duke still holds me worthy his consideration or finds in me aught worthy to be loved that little rivulet flow'd from this spring and so from me report him
fame already hath fill'd his highness' ears with the true story of what you are and how much better'd by him and 'tis his purpose to reward the travail of this grave sir with a magnificent hand for though his tenderness hardly could consent to have you one hour absent from his sight for full three years he did deny himself the pleasure he took in you that you here from this great master might arrive unto the theory of those high mysteries which you by action must make plain in court
'tis therefore his request and that from him your excellence must grant a strict command that instantly it being not five hours' riding you should take horse and visit him
these his letters will yield you further reasons
farewell the flower then of the country's garland
this is our sun and when he's set we must not expect or spring or summer but resolve for a perpetual winter
pray you observe reading the letters
the frequent changes in his face
as if his much unwillingness to leave your house contended with his duty
now he appears collected and resolved
it is the duke
the duke upon whose favour all my hopes and fortunes do depend nor must i check at his commands for any private motives that do invite my stay here though they are almost not to be master'd
my obedience in my departing suddenly shall confirm i am his highness' creature yet i hope a little stay to take a solemn farewell of all those ravishing pleasures i have tasted in this my sweet retirement from my guardian and his incomparable daughter cannot meet an ill construction
i will answer that use your own will
i would speak to you sir in such a phrase as might express the thanks my heart would gladly pay but char
i conceive you and something i would say but i must do it in that dumb rhetoric which you make use of for i do wish you all i know not how my toughness melts and spite of my discretion i must turn woman
what a sympathy there is between them
were i on the rack i could not shed a tear
but i am mad and ten to one shall hang myself for sorrow before i shift my shirt
but hear you sir i'll separate you when you are gone what will become of me
why thou shalt to court with me
to see you worried
yes sir for bring this sweet face to the court there will be such a longing 'mong the madams who shall engross it first nay fight and scratch for 't that if they be not stopp'd so much for him
there's something else that troubles me
why how to behave myself in court and tightly
i have been told the very place transforms men and that not one of a thousand that before lived honestly in the country on plain salads but bring him thither mark me that and feed him but a month or two with custards and court cake bread and he turns knave immediately
i'd be honest but i must follow the fashion or die a beggar
and if i ever reach my hopes believe it we will share fortunes
this acknowledgment enter binds me your debtor ever
here comes one in whose sad looks you easily may read what her heart suffers in that she is forced to take her last leave of you
as i live a beauty without parallel
must you go then so suddenly
there's no evasion lidia to gain the least delay though i would buy it at any rate
greatness with private men esteem'd a blessing is to me a curse and we whom for our high births they conclude the only freemen are the only slaves
happy the golden mean
had i been born in a poor sordid cottage not nursed up with expectation to command a court i might like such of your condition sweetest have ta'en a safe and middle course and not as i am now against my choice compell'd or to lie groveling on the earth or raised so high upon the pinnacles of state that i must either keep my height with danger or fall with certain ruin
your own goodness will be your faithful guard
for had i been your equal i might have seen and liked with mine own eyes and not as now with others' i might still and without observation or envy as i have done continued my delights with you that are alone in my esteem the abstract of society we might walk in solitary groves or in choice gardens from the variety of curious flowers contemplate nature's workmanship and wonders and then for change near to the murmur of some bubbling fountain i might hear you sing and from the well tuned accents of your tongue in my imagination conceive with what melodious harmony a quire of angels sing above their maker's praises and then with chaste discourse as we return'd imp feathers to the broken wings of time and all this i must part from
you forget the haste imposed upon us
one word more and then i come
and after this when with continued innocence of love and service i had grown ripe for hymeneal joys embracing you but with a lawful flame i might have been your husband
sir i was and ever am your servant but it was and 'tis far from me in a thought to cherish such saucy hopes
if i had been the heir of all the globes and sceptres mankind bows to at my best you had deserved me as i am howe'er unworthy in my virgin zeal i wish you as a partner of your bed a princess equal to you such a one that may make it the study of her life with all the obedience of a wife to please you
may you have happy issue and i live to be their humblest handmaid
i am dumb and can make no reply
your excellence will be benighted
this kiss bathed in tears may learn you what i should say
give me leave to wait on you to your horse
and me to bring you to the one half of your journey
your love puts your age to too much trouble
i grow young when most i serve you
sir the duke shall thank you
a room in the palace
his highness cannot take it ill
however we with our duties shall express our care for the safety of his dukedom
and our loves enter to his person
here he comes present it boldly
they kneel tenders a paper
what needs this form
we are not grown so proud as to disdain familiar conference with such as are to counsel and direct us
this kind of adoration show'd not well in the old roman emperors who forgetting that they were flesh and blood would be styled gods in us to suffer it were worse
still the old suit
with too much curiousness you have too often search'd this wound which yields security and rest not trouble to me
for here you grieve that my firm resolution continues me a widower and that my want of issue to succeed me in my government when i am dead may breed distraction in the state and make the name and family of the medici now admired contemptible
and with strong reasons sir
for were you old and past hope to beget the model of yourself we should be silent
but being in your height and pride of years as you are now great sir and having too in your possession the daughter of the deceased duke of urbin and his heir whose guardian you are made were you but pleased to think her worthy of you besides children the dukedom she brings with her for a dower will yield a large increase of strength and power to those fair territories which already acknowledge you their absolute lord
you press us with solid arguments we grant and though we stand not bound to yield account to any why we do this or that the full consent of our subjects being included in our will we out of our free bounties will deliver the motives that divert us
you well know that three years since to our much grief we lost our duchess such a duchess that the world in her whole course of life yields not a lady that can with imitation deserve to be her second in her grave we buried all thoughts of woman let this satisfy for any second marriage
now whereas you name the heir of urbin as a princess of great revenues 'tis confess'd she is so but for some causes private to ourself we have disposed her otherwise
yet despair not for you ere long with joy shall understand that in our princely care we have provided one worthy to succeed us
we submit and hold the counsels of great cozimo oraculous
nay forbear all ceremony
you look sprightly friend and promise in your clear aspect some novel that may delight us
o sir i would not be the harbinger of aught that might distaste you and therefore know for 'twere a sin to torture your highness' expectation your vice admiral by my directions hath surprised the galleys appointed to transport the asian tribute of the great turk
a richer prize was never brought into florence
still my nightingale that with sweet accents dost assure me that my spring of happiness comes fast upon me
i pronounce that wretch an enemy to brave and thriving action that dares believe but in a thought we are too prodigal in our favours to this man whose merits though with him we should divide our dukedom still continue us his debtor
'tis far from me
we all applaud it
nay blush not sanazarro we are proud of what we build up in thee nor can our election be disparaged since we have not received into our bosom and our grace a glorious lazy drone grown fat with feeding on others' toil but an industrious bee that crops the sweet flowers of our enemies and every happy evening returns loaden with wax and honey to our hive
my best endeavours never can discharge the service i should pay
thou art too modest but we will study how to give and when enter and before it be demanded
let me eye thee better boy
in thee methinks my sister lives again for her love i will be a father to thee for thou art my adopted son
your servant and humblest subject
thy hard travel nephew requires soft rest and therefore we forbear for the present an account how thou hast spent thy absent hours
see signiors see our care without a second bed provides you of a hopeful prince
carry him to his lodgings and for his further honour sanazarro with the rest do you attend him
all true pleasures circle your highness
as the rising sun we do receive you
may this never set but shine upon you ever
what entertainment found you from carolo de charomonte
he's ever like himself noble and hospitable
but did my nephew depart thence willingly
he obey'd your summons as did become him
yet it was apparent but that he durst not cross your will he would have sojourn'd longer there he ever finding variety of sweetest entertainment
but there was something else nor can i blame his youth though with some trouble he took leave of such a sweet companion
the daughter sir of signior carolo fair lidia a virgin at all parts but in her birth and fortunes equal to him
the rarest beauties italy can make boast of are but mere shadows to her she the substance of all perfection
and what increases the wonder sir her body's matchless form is better'd by the pureness of her soul
such sweet discourse such ravishing behaviour such charming language such enchanting manners with a simplicity that shames all courtship flow hourly from her that i do believe had circe or calypso her sweet graces wandering ulysses never had remember'd penelope or ithaca
be not rapt so
your excellence would be so had you seen her
take up take up
but did your observation note any passage of affection between her and my nephew
how it should be otherwise between them is beyond my best imagination
cupid's arrows were useless there for of necessity their years and dispositions do accord so they must wound one another
thou art my secretary contarino and more skill'd in politic designs of state than in thy judgment of a beauty give me leave in this to doubt it
go to my cabinet you shall find there letters newly received touching the state of urbin
pray you with care peruse them leave the search of this to us
i do obey in all things
a diamond so long conceal'd and never worn in court
of such sweet feature
and he on whom i fix my dukedom's hopes made captive to it
our eyes are every where and we will make a strict inquiry
is my nephew at his rest
i saw him in bed sir
'tis well and does the princess fiorinda nay do not blush she is rich urbin's heir continue constant in her favours to you
dread sir she may dispense them as she pleases but i look up to her as on a princess i dare not be ambitious of and hope her prodigal graces shall not render me offender to your highness
he whom i favour as i do my friend may take all lawful graces that become him but touching this hereafter
i have now and though perhaps it may appear a trifle serious employment for thee
i stand ready for any act you please
i know it friend
have you ne'er heard of lidia the daughter of carolo charomonte
him i know sir for a noble gentleman and my worthy friend but never heard of her
she is deliver'd and feelingly to us by contarino for a masterpiece in nature
i would have you ride suddenly thither to behold this wonder but not as sent by us that's our first caution the second is and carefully observe it that though you are a bachelor and endow'd with all those perfections that may take a virgin on forfeit of our favour do not tempt her it may be her fair graces do concern us
pretend what business you think fit to gain access unto her father's house and there make full discovery of her and return me a true relation i have some ends in it with which we will acquaint you
this is sir an easy task
yet one that must exact your secrecy and diligence
let not your stay be long
it shall not sir
farewell and be as you would keep our favour careful
a room in fiorinda's house
how does this dressing show
'tis of itself curious and rare but borrowing ornament as it does from your grace that deigns to wear it incomparable
i cannot your excellence is above it
were we less perfect yet being as we are an absolute princess we of necessity must be chaste wise fair by our prerogative
yet all these fail to move where i would have them
how received count sanazarro the rich scarf i sent him for his last visit
with much reverence i dare not say affection
he express'd more ceremony in his humble thanks than feeling of the favour and appear'd wilfully ignorant in my opinion of what it did invite him to
no matter he's blind with too much light
have you not heard of any private mistress he's engaged to
not any and this does amaze me madam that he a soldier should in his manners be so averse to women
troth i know not
i do suspect him for i learnt last night when the great duke went to rest attended by one private follower he took horse but whither he's rid or to what end i cannot guess at but i will find it out
do faithful servant enter we would not be abused
who have we here
how the fool stares
and looks as if he were conning his neck verse
if i now prove perfect in my a b c of courtship calandrino is made for ever
i am sent let me see on a how d'ye as they call 't
what wouldst thou say
let me see my notes
these are her lodgings well
art thou an ass
thou art a court wagtail looking on his instructions
he has given it you
and then say to the illustrious fi o rin da i have it
why this fop doodle
leave chattering bull finch you would put me out but 'twill not do
then after you have made your three obeisances to her kneel and kiss the skirt of her gown
i am glad it is no worse
this is sport unlook'd for
are you the princess
then stand fair for i am choleric and do not nip a hopeful blossom
out again three low obeisances fior
i come on then
thus far i am right
now for the last
kisses the skirt of her gown
she is perfumed all over
sure great women instead of little dogs are privileged to carry musk cats
now the ceremony is pass'd what is the substance
i'll peruse my instructions and then tell you
her skirt kiss'd inform her highness that your lord calam
prince giovanni who entreats your grace that he with your good favour may have leave to present his service to you
i think i have nick'd it for a courtier of the first form
enter and a gentleman
return unto the prince but he prevents my answer
calaminta take him off and for the neat delivery of his message give him ten ducats such rare parts as yours are to be cherish'd
we will share i know it is the custom of the court when ten are promised five is fair
the princess shall never know it so you despatch me quickly and bid me not come to morrow
pray you friend inform the duke i am putting into act what he commanded
i am proud to be employ'd sir
madam that without warrant i presume to trench upon your privacies may argue rudeness of manners but the free access your princely courtesy vouchsafes to all that come to pay their services gives me hope to find a gracious pardon
if you please not to make that an offence in your construction which i receive as a large favour from you there needs not this apology
you continue as you were ever the greatest mistress of fair entertainment
you are sir the master and in the country have learnt to outdo all that in court is practised
but why should we talk at such distance
you are welcome sir
we have been more familiar and since you will impose the province you should govern of boldness on me give me leave to say you are too punctual
sit sir and discourse as we were used
your excellence knows so well how to command that i can never err when i obey you
nay no more of this
you shall o'ercome no more i pray you sir
and what delights pray you be liberal in your relation hath the country life afforded you
all pleasures gracious madam but the happiness to converse with your sweet virtues
i had a grave instructor and my hours design'd to serious studies yielded me pleasure with profit in the knowledge of what before i was ignorant in the signior carolo de charomonte being skilful to guide me through the labyrinth of wild passions that labour'd to imprison my free soul a slave to vicious sloth
you speak him well
but short of his deserts
then for the time of recreation i was allow'd against the form follow'd by jealous parents in italy full liberty to partake his daughter's sweet society
she's a virgin happy in all endowments which a poet could fancy in his mistress being herself a school of goodness where chaste maids may learn without the aids of foreign principles by the example of her life and pureness to be as she is excellent
i but give you a brief epitome of her virtues which dilated on at large and to their merit would make an ample story
your whole age so spent with such a father and a daughter could not be tedious to you
true great princess and now since you have pleased to grant the hearing of my time's expense in the country give me leave to entreat the favour to be made acquainted what service or what objects in the court have in your excellency's acceptance proved most gracious to you
i'll meet your demand and make a plain discovery
the duke's care for my estate and person holds the first and choicest place then the respect the courtiers pay gladly to me not to be contemn'd
but that which raised in me the most delight for i am a friend to valour was to hear the noble actions truly reported of the brave count sanazarro
i profess when it hath been and fervently deliver'd how boldly in the horror of a fight cover'd with fire and smoke and as if nature had lent him wings like lightning he hath fallen upon the turkish galleys i have heard it with a kind of pleasure which hath whisper'd to me this worthy must be cherish'd
'twas a bounty you never can repent
i glory in it
and when he did return but still with conquest his armour off not young antinous appear'd more courtly all the graces that render a man's society dear to ladies like pages waiting on him and it does work strangely on me
to divert your thoughts though they are fix'd upon a noble subject i am a suitor to you
you will ask i do presume what i may grant and then it must not be denied
it is a favour for which i hope your excellence will thank me
that you would please to take occasion to move the duke that you with his allowance may command this matchless virgin lidia of whom i cannot speak too much to wait upon you
she's such a one upon the forfeit of your good opinion of me that will not be a blemish to your train
he loves her but i will fit him with a suit
i pause not as if it bred or doubt or scruple in me to do what you desire for i'll effect it and make use of a fair and fit occasion yet in return i ask a boon of you and hope to find you in your grant to me as i have been to you
'tis near allied to yours
that you would be a suitor to the duke not to expose after so many trials of his faith the noble sanazarro to all dangers as if he were a wall to stand the fury of a perpetual battery but now to grant him after his long labours rest and liberty to live in court his arms and his victorious sword and shield hung up for monuments
i'll embrace fair princess enter the soonest opportunity
nay blush not we smile on your privacy and come not to disturb you
you are equals and without prejudice to either's honours may make a mutual change of love and courtship till you are made one and with holy rites and we give suffrage to it
to ourself in this but now break off too much taken at once of the most curious viands dulls the sharp edge of appetite
we are now for other sports in which our pleasure is that you should keep us company
he's blind with too much light
ennobled by milton "dark with excess of light
a hall in charomonte's house
is my lord stirring
let us take then our morning draught
such as eat store of beef mutton and capons may preserve their healths with that thin composition call'd small beer as 'tis said they do in england
but italians that think when they have supp'd upon an olive a root or bunch of raisins 'tis a feast must kill those crudities rising from cold herbs with hot and lusty wines
a happiness those tramontanes ne'er tasted
have they not store of wine there
yes and drink more in two hours than the dutchmen or the dane in four and twenty
but what is 't
french trash made of rotten grapes and dregs and lees of spain with welsh metheglin a drench to kill a horse
but this pure nectar being proper to our climate is too fine to brook the roughness of the sea the spirit of this begets in us quick apprehensions and active executions whereas their gross feeding makes their understanding like it they can fight and that's their all
security dwells about this house i think the gate's wide open and not a servant stirring
see the horses set up and clothed
i'll make bold to press a little further
who is this count sanazarro
yes i know him
quickly remove the flagon
a good day to you friends
nay do not conceal your physic i approve it and if you please will be a patient with you
a health to yours
i see you love yourselves and i commend you 'tis the best wisdom
may it please your honour to walk a turn in the gallery i'll acquaint my lord with your being here
tell him i come for a visit only
'tis a handsome pile this
why here is a brave fellow and a right one nor wealth nor greatness makes him proud
there are too few of them for most of our new courtiers whose fathers were familiar with the prices of oil and corn with when and where to vent them and left their heirs rich from their knowledge that way like gourds shot up in a night disdain to speak but to cloth of tissue
enter in a nightgown following
stand you prating knaves when such a guest is under my roof
see all the rooms perfumed
this is the man that carries the sway and swing of the court and i had rather preserve him mine with honest offices than but i'll make no comparisons
bid my daughter trim herself up to the height
which way went he
to the round gallery
i will entertain him as fits his worth and quality but no further
strangers barbarians so the italians called and still call all who live beyond the alps ultra montes
in a subsequent speech the author does not forget to satirize the acknowledged propensity of his countrymen to drinking "your dane your german and your swag bellied hollander are nothing to your englishman
" if caponi as well as iago be not however too severe upon us it must be confessed that our ancestors were apt scholars and soon bettered the instructions which they received
sir richard baker as mr
gilchrist observes treating of the wars in the low countries about the end of the sixteenth century says "here it must not be omitted that the english who of all the dwellers in the northern parts of the world were hitherto the least drinkers and deservedly praised for their sobriety in these dutch wars learned to be drunkards and brought the vice so far to overspread the kingdom that laws were fain to be enacted for repressing it
a gallery in the same
i cannot apprehend yet i have argued all ways i can imagine for what reasons the great duke does employ me hither and what does increase the miracle i must render a strict and true account at my return of lidia this lord's daughter and describe in what she's excellent and where defective
'tis a hard task he that will undergo to make a judgment of a woman's beauty and see through all her plasterings and paintings had need of lynceus' eyes and with more ease may look like him through nine mud walls than make a true discovery of her
but the intents and secrets of my prince's heart must be served and not search'd into
most noble sir excuse my age subject to ease and sloth that with no greater speed i have presented my service with your welcome
'tis more fit that i should ask your pardon for disturbing your rest at this unseasonable hour
but my occasions carrying me so near your hospitable house my stay being short too your goodness and the name of friend which you are pleased to grace me with gave me assurance a visit would not offend
i feel myself much younger for the favour
how is it with our gracious master
he sir holds still his wonted greatness and confesses himself your debtor for your love and care to the prince giovanni and had sent particular thanks by me had his grace known the quick despatch of what i was design'd to would have licensed me to see you
i am rich in his acknowledgment
i have heard your happiness in a daughter
sits the wind there
fame gives her out for a rare masterpiece
'tis a plain village girl sir but obedient that's her best beauty sir
let my desire to see her find a fair construction from you i bring no loose thought with me
you are that way my lord free from suspicion
her own manners without an imposition from me i hope will prompt her to it
enter and as she is she comes to make a tender of that service which she stands bound to pay
with your fair leave i make bold to salute you
sir you have it
how he falls off
my lord though silence best becomes a maid and to be curious to know but what concerns myself and with becoming distance may argue me of boldness i must borrow so much of modesty as to inquire prince giovanni's health
he cannot want what you are pleased to wish him
and then there is no blessing that can make a hopeful and a noble prince complete but should fall on him
he was our north star the light and pleasure of our eyes
where am i feel myself another thing
can charms be writ on such pure rubies
her lips melt as soon as touch'd
not those smooth gales that glide o'er happy araby or rich sabæa creating in their passage gums and spices can serve for a weak simile to express the sweetness of her breath
such a brave stature homer bestow'd on pallas every limb proportion'd to it
i crave your pardon and yours matchless maid for such i must report you
there's no notice taken all this while of me
and i must add if your discourse and reason parallel the rareness of your more than human form you are a wonder
pray you my lord make trial she can speak i can assure you and that my presence may not take from her freedom i will leave you for know my lord my confidence dares trust her where and with whom she pleases
yes my good lord
i have employment for you
what's your will sir
madam you are so large a theme to treat of and every grace about you offers to me such copiousness of language that i stand doubtful which first to touch at
if i err as in my choice i may let me entreat you before i do offend to sign my pardon let this the emblem of your innocence give me assurance
my hand join'd to yours without this superstition confirms it
nor need i fear you will dwell long upon me the barrenness of the subject yielding nothing that rhetoric with all her tropes and figures can amplify
yet since you are resolved to prove yourself a courtier in my praise as i'm a woman and you men affirm our sex loves to be flatter'd i'll endure it
now when you please begin
if the great duke made this his end to try my constant temper though i am vanquished 'tis his fault not mine for i am flesh and blood and have affections like other men
who can behold the temples or holy altars but the objects work devotion in him
and i may as well walk over burning iron with bare feet and be unscorch'd as look upon this beauty without desire and that desire pursued too till it be quench'd with the enjoying those delights which to achieve danger is nothing and loyalty but a word
i ne'er was proud nor can find i am guilty of a thought deserving this neglect
suppose his greatness loves her himself why makes he choice of me to be his agent
it is tyranny to call one pinch'd with hunger to a feast and at that instant cruelly deny him to taste of what he sees
allegiance tempted too far is like the trial of a good sword on an anvil as that often flies in pieces without service to the owner so trust enforced too far proves treachery and is too late repented
pray you sir or license me to leave you or deliver the reasons which invite you to command my tedious waiting on you
as i live i know not what to think on 't
is 't his pride or his simplicity
whither have my thoughts carried me from myself
in this my dulness i've lost an opportunity turns to her she falls off
'tis true i was not bred in court nor live a star there nor shine in rich embroideries and pearl as they that are the mistresses of great fortunes are every day adorn'd with sanaz
will you vouchsafe your ear sweet lady
yet i may be bold for my integrity and fame to rank with such as are more glorious
though i never did injury yet i am sensible when i'm contemn'd and scorn'd
will you please to hear me
o the difference of natures
giovanni a prince in expectation when he lived here stole courtesy from heaven and would not to the meanest servant in my father's house have kept such distance
pray you do not think me unworthy of your ear it was your beauty that turn'd me statue
i can speak fair lady
and i can hear
the harshness of your courtship cannot corrupt my courtesy
will you hear me if i speak of love
provided you be modest i were uncivil else
they are come to parley i must observe this nearer
you are a rare one and such but that my haste commands me hence i could converse with ever
will you grace me with leave to visit you again
so you at your return to court do me the favour to make a tender of my humble service to the prince giovanni
ever touching upon that string
and will you give me hope of future happiness
that as i shall find you the fort that's yielded at the first assault is hardly worth the taking
she is a magazine of all perfection and 'tis death to part from her yet i must
a homely breakfast does attend your lordship such as the place affords
no i have feasted already here my thanks and so i leave you i will see you again
till this unhappy hour i was never lost and what to do or say i have not yet determined
under your favour sir his coming hither was to little purpose for any thing i heard from him
i do advise you with a father's love and tenderness of your honour as i would not have you too harsh in giving entertainment so by no means be credulous for great men till they have gain'd their ends are giants in their promises but those obtain'd weak pigmies in their performance
and it is a maxim allow'd among them so they may deceive they may swear any thing for the queen of love as they hold constantly does never punish but smile at lovers' perjuries
yet be wise too and when you are sued to in a noble way be neither nice nor scrupulous
all you speak sir i hear as oracles nor will digress from your directions
so shall you keep your fame untainted
as i would my life sir
an anteroom in the palace
leave the horses with my grooms but be you careful with your best diligence and speed to find out the prince and humbly in my name entreat i may exchange some private conference with him before the great duke know of my arrival
i haste my lord
here i'll attend his coming and see you keep yourself as much as may be conceal'd from all men else
to serve your lordship i wish i were invisible
i am driven into a desperate strait and cannot steer a middle course and of the two extremes which i must make election of i know not which is more full of horror
never servant stood more engaged to a magnificent master than i to cozimo and all those honours and glories by his grace conferr'd upon me or by my prosperous services deserved if now i should deceive his trust and make a shipwreck of my loyalty are ruin'd
and on the other side if i discover lidia's divine perfections all my hopes in her are sunk never to be buoy'd up for 'tis impossible but as soon as seen she must with adoration be sued to
a hermit at his beads but looking on her at this object would take fire
nor is the duke such an hippolytus but that this phædra but seen must force him to forsake the groves and dian's huntmanship proud to serve under venus' soft ensigns
no there is no way for me to hope fruition of my ends but to conceal her beauties and how that may be effected is as hard a task as with a veil to cover the sun's beams or comfortable light
three years the prince lived in her company and contarino the secretary hath possess'd the duke what a rare piece she is but he's my creature and may with ease be frighted to deny what he hath said and if my long experience with some strong reasons i have thought upon cannot o'er reach a youth my practice yields me but little profit
enter with the servant
you are well return'd sir
when that your grace shall know the motives that forced me to invite you to this trouble you will excuse my manners
sir there needs not this circumstance between us
you are ever my noble friend
you shall have further cause to assure you of my faith and zeal to serve you and when i have committed to your trust presuming still on your retentive silence a secret of no less importance than my honour nay my head it will confirm what value you hold with me
pray you believe sir what you deliver to me shall be lock'd up in a strong cabinet of which you yourself shall keep the key for here i pawn my honour which is the best security i can give yet it shall not be discover'd
this assurance is more than i with modesty could demand from such a paymaster but i must be sudden and therefore to the purpose
can your excellence in your imagination conceive on what design or whither the duke's will commanded me hence last night
no i assure you and it had been a rudeness to inquire of that i was not call'd to
grant me hearing and i will make you truly understand it only did concern you
you in your present state and future fortunes for both lie at the stake
you much amaze me
pray you resolve this riddle
you know the duke if he die issueless as yet he is determines you his heir
it hath pleased his highness oft to profess so much
but say he should be won to prove a second wife on whom he may beget a son how in a moment will all those glorious expectations which render you reverenced and remarkable be in a moment blasted howe'er you are his much loved sister's son
i must bear it with patience and in me it is a duty that i was born with and 'twere much unfit for the receiver of a benefit to offer for his own ends to prescribe laws to the giver's pleasure
sweetly answer'd and like your noble self
this your rare temper so wins upon me that i would not live if that by honest arts i can prevent it to see your hopes made frustrate
and but think how you shall be transform'd from what you are should this as heaven avert it
it must disturb your peace for whereas now being as you are received for the heir apparent you are no sooner seen but wonder'd at the signiors making it a business to inquire how you have slept and as you walk the streets of florence the glad multitude in throngs press but to see you and with joy the father pointing with his finger tells his son this is the prince the hopeful prince that must hereafter rule and you obey him
great ladies beg your picture and make love to that despairing to enjoy the substance
and but the last night when 'twas only rumour'd that you were come to court as if you had by sea pass'd hither from another world what general shouts and acclamations follow'd
the bells rang loud the bonfires blazed and such as loved not wine carousing to your health were drunk and blush'd not at it
and is this a happiness to part with
i allow these as flourishes of fortune with which princes are often soothed but never yet esteem'd them for real blessings
yet all these were paid to what you may be not to what you are for if the great duke but show to his servants a son of his own you shall like one obscure pass unregarded
i confess command is not to be contemn'd and if my fate appoint me to it as i may i'll bear it with willing shoulders
but my lord as yet you've told me of a danger coming towards me but have not named it
that is soon deliver'd
great cozimo your uncle as i more than guess for 'tis no frivolous circumstance that does persuade my judgment to believe it purposes to be married
with whom and on what terms
pray you instruct me
with the fair lidia
the daughter of signior charomonte
pardon me though i appear incredulous for on my knowledge he ne'er saw her
that is granted but contarino hath so sung her praises and given her out for such a masterpiece that he's transported with it sir and love steals sometimes through the ear into the heart as well as by the eye
the duke no sooner heard her described but i was sent in post to see her and return my judgment of her
and what's your censure
'tis a pretty creature
yes yes i have seen worse faces
her limbs are neatly form'd
she hath a waist indeed sized to love's wish
a delicate hand too
then for a leg and foot giov
and there i leave you for i presumed no further
as she is sir i know she wants no gracious part that may allure the duke and if he only see her she is his own he will not be denied and then you are lost yet if you'll second me as you have reason for it most concerns you i can prevent all yet
i would you could a noble way
i will cry down her beauties especially the beauties of her mind as much as contarino hath advanced them and this i hope will breed forgetfulness and kill affection in him but you must join with me in my report if you be question'd
i never told a lie yet and i hold it in some degree blasphémous to dispraise what's worthy admiration yet for once i will dispraise a little and not vary from your relation
be constant in it
my lord the duke hath seen your man and wonders enter and attendants
you come not to him
see if his desire to have conference with you hath not brought him hither in his own person
they are comely coursers and promise swiftness
they are of my knowledge of the best race in naples
you are nephew as i hear an excellent horseman and we like it 'tis a fair grace in a prince
pray you make trial of their strength and speed and if you think them fit for your employment with a liberal hand reward the gentleman that did present them from the viceroy of naples
i will use my best endeavour sir
wait on my nephew
nay stay you contarino be within call it may be we shall use you
exit you have rode hard sir and we thank you for it every minute seems irksome and tedious to us till you have made your discovery
say friend have you seen this phoenix of our age
i have seen a maid sir but if that i have judgment no such wonder as she was deliver'd to you
it may be she was look'd on with admiration in the country sir but if compared with many in your court she would appear but ordinary
contarino reports her otherwise
such as ne'er saw swans may think crows beautiful
how is her behaviour
'tis like the place she lives in
how her wit discourse and entertainment
very coarse i would not willingly say poor and rude but had she all the beauties of fair women the dulness of her soul would fright me from her
you are curious sir
i know not what to think on 't
where was thy judgment man to extol a virgin sanazarro tells me is nearer to deformity
i saw her and curiously perused her and i wonder that she that did appear to me that know what beauty is not worthy the observing should so transport you
troth my lord i thought then coz
didst thou not affirm it
i confess sir i did believe so then but now i hear my lord's opinion to the contrary i am of another faith for 'tis not fit that i should contradict him
i am dim sir but he's sharp sighted
this is to my wish
we know not what to think of this yet would not re enter and determine rashly of it
how do you like my nephew's horsemanship
in my judgment sir it is exact and rare
and to my fancy he did present great alexander mounted on his bucephalus
you are right courtiers and know it is your duty to cry up all actions of a prince
do not betray yourself you're safe i have done my part
i thank you nor will i fail
what's your opinion nephew of the horses
two of them are in my judgment the best i ever back'd i mean the roan sir and the brown bay but for the chestnut colour'd though he be full of metal hot and fiery he treads weak in his pasterns
so come nearer this exercise hath put you into a sweat take this and dry it and now i command you to tell me truly what's your censure of charomonte's daughter lidia
i am sir a novice in my judgment of a lady but such as 'tis your grace shall have it freely
i would not speak ill of her and am sorry if i keep myself a friend to truth i cannot report her as i would so much i owe her reverend father but i'll give you sir as near as i can her character in little
she's of a goodly stature and her limbs not disproportion'd for her face it is far from deformity yet they flatter her that style it excellent her manners are simple and innocent but her discourse and wit deserve my pity more than praise at the best my lord she is a handsome picture and that said all is spoken
i believe you i ne'er yet found you false
nor ever shall sir
forgive me matchless lidia
too much love and jealous fear to lose thee do compel me against my will my reason and my knowledge to be a poor detractor of that beauty which fluent ovid if he lived again would want words to express
pray you make choice of the richest of our furniture for these horses to and take my nephew with you we in this will follow his directions
could i find now the princess fiorinda and persuade her to be silent in the suit that i moved to her all were secure
in that my lord i'll aid you
we will be private leave us
exeunt all but all my studies and serious meditations aim no further than this young man's good
he was my sister's son and she was such a sister when she lived i could not prize too much nor can i better make known how dear i hold her memory than in my cherishing the only issue which she hath left behind her
you are welcome to us
i have found it sir
all things go well in urbin
your gracious care to me an orphan frees me from all suspicion that my jealous fears can drive into my fancy
the next summer in our own person we will bring you thither and seat you in your own
when you think fit sir
but in the mean time with your highness' pardon i am a suitor to you
name it madam with confidence to obtain it
that you would please to lay a strict command on charomonte to bring his daughter lidia to the court and pray you think sir that 'tis not my purpose to employ her as a servant but to use her as a most wish'd companion
the hopeful prince your nephew sir hath given her to me for such an abstract of perfection in all that can be wish'd for in a virgin as beauty music ravishing discourse quickness of apprehension with choice manners and learning too not usual with women that i am much ambitious though i shall appear but as a foil to set her off to be by her instructed and supplied in what i am defective
did my nephew seriously deliver this
i assure your grace with zeal and vehemency and even when with his best words he strived to set her forth though the rare subject made him eloquent he would complain all he could say came short of her deservings
pray you have patience
this was strangely carried
are we trifled with
dare they do this
is cozimo's fury that of late was terrible grown contemptible
well we will clear our brows and undermine their secret works though they have digg'd like moles and crush them with the tempest of my wrath when i appear most calm
he is unfit to command others that knows not to use it and with all rigour yet my stern looks shall not discover my intents for i will strike when i begin to frown
you are the mistress of that you did demand
i thank your highness but speed in the performance of the grant doubles the favour sir
you shall possess it sooner than you expect only be pleased to be ready when my secretary waits on you to take the fresh air
my nephew and my bosom friend so to cheat me
re enter and sanaz
where should this princess be
nor in her lodgings nor in the private walks her own retreat which she so much frequented
by my life she's with the duke
and i much more than fear her forwardness to prefer my suit hath ruin'd what with such care we built up
have you furnish'd those coursers as we will'd you
there's no sign of anger in his looks
they are complete sir
'tis well to your rest
soft sleeps wait on you madam
to morrow with the rising of the sun be ready to ride with us
they with more safety had trod on fork tongued adders than provoked me
i come not to be thank'd sir for the speedy performance of my promise touching lidia it is effected
the duke no sooner heard me with my best of language describe her excellencies as you taught me but he confirm'd it
you look sad as if you wish'd it were undone
no gracious madam i am your servant for 't
be you as careful for what i moved to you
count sanazarro now i perceive you honour me in vouchsafing to wear so slight a favour
'tis a grace i am unworthy of
you merit more in prizing so a trifle
take this diamond i'll second what i have begun for know your valour hath so won upon me that 'tis not to be resisted i have said sir and leave you to interpret it
this to me is wormwood
'tis apparent we are taken in our own noose
what's to be done
and 'tis a punishment justly fallen upon me for leaving truth a constant mistress that ever protects her servants to become a slave to lies and falsehood
what excuse can we make to the duke what mercy hope for our packing being laid open
'tis not to be question'd but his purposed journey is to see fair lidia
and to divert him impossible
there's now no looking backward
and which way to go on with safety not to be imagined
give me leave i have an embryon in my brain which i despair not may be brought to form and fashion provided you will be open breasted
'tis no time now our dangers being equal to conceal a thought from you
what power hold you o'er lidia
do you think that with some hazard of her life she would prevent your ruin
i presume so if in the undertaking it she stray not from what becomes her innocence and to that 'tis far from me to press her i myself will rather suffer
'tis enough this night write to her by your servant calandrino as i shall give directions my man enter fantastically dressed
shall bear him company
see sir to my wish he does appear but much transform'd from what he was when he came hither
i confess i am not very wise and yet i find a fool so he be parcel knave in court may flourish and grow rich
i am in contemplation
do not you know me
i tell thee no on forfeit of my place i must not know myself much less my father but by petition that petition lined too with golden birds that sing to the tune of profit or i am deaf
but you've your sense of feeling
offering to strike him
nay pray you forbear
i have all that's requisite to the making up of a signior my spruce ruff my hooded cloak long stocking and paned hose my case of toothpicks and my silver fork to convey an olive neatly to my mouth and what is all in all my pockets ring a golden peal
o that the peasants in the country my quondam fellows but saw me as i am how they would admire and worship me
as they shall for instantly you must thither
my grand signior vouchsafe a beso las manos and a cringe of the last edition
you must ride post with letters this night to lidia
an it please your grace shall i use my coach or footcloth mule
you widgeon you are to make all speed think not of pomp
follow for your instructions sirrah
i have one suit to you my good lord
that you would give me a subtile court charm to defend me from the infectious air of the country
why as this court air taught me knavish wit by which i am grown rich if that again should turn me fool and honest vain hopes farewell
for i must die a beggar
go to sirrah you'll be whipt for this
leave fooling and attend us
a hall in charomonte's house
daughter i have observed since the prince left us whose absence i mourn with you and the visit count sanazarro gave us you have nourish'd sad and retired thoughts and parted with that freedom and alacrity of spirit with which you used to cheer me
for the count sir all thought of him does with his person die but i confess ingenuously i cannot so soon forget the choice and chaste delights the courteous conversation of the prince and without stain i hope afforded me when he made this house a court
it is in us to keep it so without him
want we know not and all we can complain of heaven be praised for 't is too much plenty and we will make use of enter and other servants
when shall we have this lusty dance
in the afternoon sir
'tis a device i wis of my own making and such a one as shall make your signiorship know i have not been your butler for nothing but have crotchets in my head
we'll trip it tightly and make my sad young mistress merry again or i'll forswear the cellar
if we had our fellow calandrino here to dance his part we were perfect
he was a rare fellow but i fear the court hath spoil'd him
when i was young i could have cut a caper on a pinnacle but now i am old and wise
keep your figure fair and follow but the sample i shall set you the duke himself will send for us and laugh at us and that were credit
who have we here
i find what was brawn in the country in the court grows tender
the bots on these jolting jades
i am bruised to jelly
a coach for my money
now to my postures
let my hand have the honour to convey a kiss from my lips to the cover of your foot dear signior
you stoop too low sir
the hem of your vestment lady your glove is for princes nay i have conn'd my distances
signior de caponi grand botelier of the mansion
how is 't man
claps him on the shoulder
be not so rustic in your salutations
signior bernardo master of the accounts
signior petruchio may you long continue your function in the chamber
when shall we learn such gambols in our villa
'tis not unlike for most of such mushrooms are so
what news at court
and not to be reveal'd
with your favour signior i am in private to confer awhile with this signora but i'll pawn my honour that neither my terse language nor my habit howe'er it may convince nor my new shrugs shall render her enamour'd
take your pleasure a little of these apish tricks may pass too much is tedious
the prince in this paper presents his service
nay it is not courtly to see the seal broke open so i leave you
signiors of the villa i'll descend to be familiar with you
have you forgot to dance
no i am better'd
will you join with us
as i like the project
let me warm my brains first with the richest grape and then i'm for you
we will want no wine
exeunt all but lid
that this comes only from the best of princes with a kind of adoration does command me to entertain it and the sweet contents kissing the letter
that are inscribed here by his hand must be much more than musical to me
all the service of my life at no part can deserve this favour
o what a virgin longing i feel on me to unrip the seal and read it
yet to break what he hath fastened rashly may appear a saucy rudeness in me
i must do it nor can i else learn his commands or serve them but with such reverence as i would open some holy writ whose grave instructions beat down rebellious sins and teach my better part how to mount upward
so opens the letter 'tis done and i with eagle's eyes will curiously peruse it
chaste lidia the favours are so great on me by you conferr'd that to entreat the least addition to them in true sense may argue me of blushless impudence
but such are my extremes if you deny a further grace i must unpitied die
haste cuts off circumstance
as you're admired for beauty the report of it hath fired the duke my uncle and i fear you'll prove not with a sacred but unlawful love
if he see you as you are my hoped for light is changed into an everlasting night how to prevent it if your goodness find you save two lives and me you ever bind the honourer of your virtues were i more deaf than adders these sweet charms would through my ears find passage to my soul and soon enchant it
to save such a prince who would not perish
virtue in him must suffer and piety be forgotten
the duke's passion though it raged more than tarquin's shall not reach me
all quaint inventions of chaste virgins aid me
my prayers are heard i have 't
the duke ne'er saw me or if that fail i am again provided but for the servants
they will take what form i please to put upon them
giovanni be safe thy servant lidia assures it
let mountains of afflictions fall on me their weight is easy so i set thee free
another room in the same
are you not tired with travel sir
no no i am fresh and lusty
this day shall be ever a holiday to me that brings my prince under my humble roof
see sir my good tutor sheds tears for joy
dry them up charomonte and all forbear the room while we exchange some private words together
o my lord how grossly have we overshot ourselves
in forgetting to acquaint my guardian with our purpose all that lidia can do avails us nothing if the duke find out the truth from him
'tis now past help and we must stand the hazard hope the best sir
my loyalty doubted sir
thou hast abused our trust and in a high degree committed treason
'tis a word my innocence understands not
were my breast transparent and my thoughts to be discern'd not one spot shall be found to taint the candour of my allegiance and i must be bold to tell you sir for he that knows no guilt can know no fear 'tis tyranny to o'ercharge an honest man and such till now i've lived and such my lord i'll die
sir do not flatter yourself with hope these great and glorious words which every guilty wretch as well as you that's arm'd with impudence can with ease deliver and with as full a mouth can work on us nor shall gay flourishes of language clear what is in fact apparent
you that know only what it is instruct me for i am ignorant
this then sir we gave up on our assurance of your faith and care our nephew giovanni nay our heir in expectation to be train'd up by you as did become a prince
and i discharged it is this the treason
take us with you sir
and in respect we knew his youth was prone to women and that living in our court he might make some unworthy choice before his weaker judgment was confirm'd we did remove him from it constantly presuming you with your best endeavours rather would have quench'd those heats in him than light a torch as you have done to his looseness
my travail is ill requited sir for by my soul i was so curious that way that i granted access to none could tempt him nor did ever one syllable or obscene accent touch his ear that might corrupt him
why then with your allowance did you give free way to all familiar privacy between my nephew and your daughter
or why did you had you no other ends in 't but our service read to them and together as they had been scholars of one form grammar rhetoric philosophy story and interpret to them the close temptations of lascivious poets
or wherefore for we still had spies upon you was she still present when by your advice he was taught the use of his weapon horsemanship nay wrestling but to fan a love in her
and then forsooth his exercises ended a fair pretence of recreation for him when lidia was instructed in those graces that add to beauty he brought to admire her must hear her sing while to her voice her hand made ravishing music and this applauded dance a light lavolta with her
have you ended all you can charge me with
nor stopt you there but they must unattended walk into the silent groves and hear the amorous birds warbling their wanton notes here a sure shade of barren sicamores which the all seeing sun could not pierce through near that an arbour hung with spreading eglantine there a bubbling spring watering a bank of hyacinths and lilies with all allurements that could move to love
and could this charomonte should i grant they had been equals both in birth and fortune become your gravity
nay 'tis clear as air that your ambitious hopes to match your daughter into our family gave connivance to it and this though not in act in the intent i call high treason
hear my just defence sir and though you are my prince it will not take from your greatness to acknowledge with a blush in this my accusation you have been more sway'd by spleen and jealous suppositions than certain grounds of reason
you had a father blest be his memory
that made frequent proofs of my loyalty and faith and would i boast the dangers i have broke through in his service i could say more
nay you yourself dread sir whenever i was put unto the test found me true gold and not adulterate metal and am i doubted now
this is from the purpose
i will come to it sir your grace well knew before the prince's happy presence made my poor house rich the chiefest blessing which i gloried in though now it prove a curse was an only daughter
nor did you command me as a security to your future fears to cast her off which had you done howe'er she was the light of my eyes and comfort of my feeble age so far i prized my duty above affection she now had been a stranger to my care
but she is fair
is that her fault or mine
did ever father hold beauty in his issue for a blemish
you may if you think fit before my face in recompense of all my watchings for you with burning corrosives transform her to an ugly leper
this i will rather suffer sir than live suspected by you
let not passion carry you beyond your reason
i am calm sir yet you must give me leave to grieve i find my actions misinterpreted
sir was lidia's desire to serve the prince call'd an offence
or did she practise to seduce his youth because with her best zeal and fervour she endeavour'd to attend him
'tis a hard construction
though she be my daughter i may thus far speak her from her infancy she was ever civil her behaviour nearer simplicity than craft and malice dares not affirm in one loose gesture or light language she gave a sign she was in thought unchaste
i'll fetch her to you sir and but look on her with equal eyes you must in justice grant that your suspicion wrongs her
it may be but i must have stronger assurance of it than passionate words and not to trifle time as we came unexpected to your house we will prevent all means that may prepare her how to answer that with which we come to charge her
and howsoever it may be received as a foul breach to hospitable rites on thy allegiance and boasted faith nay forfeit of thy head we do confine thee close prisoner to thy chamber till all doubts are clear'd that do concern us
i obey sir and wish your grace had followed my hearse to my sepulchre my loyalty unsuspected rather than now but i am silent sir and let that speak my duty
i can't perceive the deficiency coz
if this man be false disguised treachery ne'er put on a shape so near to truth
re enter and ushering in and others setting forth a banquet
she comes sir of herself to present her service to you
this personage cannot invite affection
see you keep state
the manners of her mind must be transcendent if they can defend her rougher outside
may we with your liking salute you lady
let me wipe my mouth sir with my cambric handkerchief and then have at you
can this be possible
yes sir you will find her such as i gave her to you
will your dukeship sit down and eat some sugar plums
here's a castle of march pane too and this quince marmalade was of my own making all summ'd up together did cost the setting on and here is wine too as good as e'er was tapp'd
i'll be your taster for i know the fashion
now you must do me right sir you shall nor will nor choose
do you drink thus often lady
still when i am thirsty and eat when i am hungry such junkets come not every day
once more to you with a heart and a half i' faith
pray you pause a little
then i'll drink for you
i'll find you out a pledge that shall supply my place what think you of this complete signior
you are a juno and in such state must feast this jupiter what think you of him
i desire no better
and you will undertake this service for me
you are good at the sport
who a piddler sir
nay you shall sit enthroned and eat and drink as you were a duke
if your grace will have me i'll eat and drink like an emperor
take your place then takes the duke's chair
this is gross nor can the imposture but be discover'd
the duke is too sharp sighted to be deluded thus
nay pray you eat fair or divide and i will choose
cannot you use your fork as i do
gape and i will feed you
gape wider yet this is courtlike
to choke daws with i like it not
but you like this
let it come boy
what a sight is this
we could be angry with you
how much you did belie her when you told us she was only simple
this is barbarous rudeness beyond belief
i would not speak her sir worse than she was
and i my lord chose rather to deliver her better parted than she is than to take from her
enter with his fellow servants for the dance
ere i'll lose my dance i'll speak to the purpose
i am sir no prologue but in plain terms must tell you we are provided of a lusty hornpipe
prithee let us have it for we grow dull
but to make up the medley for it is of several colours we must borrow your grace's ghost here
pray you sir depose me it will not do else
i am sir the engine rises and resigns his chair
by which it moves
i will dance with my duke too i will not out
there's more in this than yet i have discover'd
some oedipus resolve this riddle
did i not foot it roundly
as i live stark drunk
we'll reward you exeunt servants with when you have cool'd yourselves in the cellar
we pity charomonte's wretched fortune in a daughter nay a monster
the place grows tedious our remove shall be with speed we'll only in a word or two take leave and comfort him
'twill rather sir increase his sorrow that you know his shame your grace may do it by letter
who sign'd you a patent to direct us
wait our coming in the garden
i more than fear it
these are strange chimeras to us what to judge of 't is past our apprehension
one command charomonte to attend us
can it be that contarino could be so besotted as to admire this prodigy
or her father to dote upon it
or does she personate for some ends unknown to us this rude behaviour which in the scene presented would appear ridiculous and impossible
o you are welcome
enter we now acknowledge the much wrong we did you in our unjust suspicion
we have seen the wonder sir your daughter
and have found her such as i did report her
what she wanted in courtship was i hope supplied in civil and modest entertainment
pray you tell us and truly we command you did you never observe she was given to drink
dare you trust your own eyes if you find her now more than distemper'd
i will pull them out sir if your grace can make this good
and if you please to grant me liberty as she is i'll fetch her and in a moment
look you do and fail not on the peril of your head
such contrarieties were never read of
charomonte is no fool nor can i think his confidence built on sand
we are abused 'tis too apparent
re enter with lid
i am indisposed sir and that life you once tender'd much endanger'd in forcing me from my chamber
here she is sir suddenly sick i grant but sure not drunk speak to my lord the duke
is this your only daughter
and my heir sir nor keep i any woman in my house unless for sordid offices but one i do maintain trimm'd up in her cast habits to make her sport and she indeed loves wine and will take too much of it and perhaps for mirth she was presented to you
it shall yield no sport to the contrivers
'tis too plain now
her presence does confirm what contarino deliver'd of her nor can sickness dim the splendour of her beauties being herself then she must exceed his praise
will your grace hear me
i'm faint and can say little
here are accents whose every syllable is musical
pray you let me raise you and awhile rest here
false sanazarro treacherous giovanni
but stand we talking
here's a storm soon raised
as thou art our subject charomonte swear to act what we command
that is an oath i long since took
then by that oath we charge thee without excuse denial or delay to apprehend and suddenly sanazarro and our ingrateful nephew
we have said it
do it without reply or we pronounce thee like them a traitor to us
see them guarded in several lodgings and forbid access to all but when we warrant
is our will heard sooner than obey'd
these are strange turns but i must not dispute them
be severe in 't
o my abused lenity
from what height is my power fall'n
o me most miserable
that being innocent makes others guilty
most gracious prince coz
pray you rise and then speak to me
my knees shall first be rooted in this earth and myrrha like i'll grow up to a tree dropping perpetual tears of sorrow which harden'd by the rough wind and turn'd to amber unfortunate virgins like myself shall wear before i'll make petition to your greatness but with such reverence my hands held up thus as i would do to heaven
you princes are as gods on earth to us and to be sued to with such humility as his deputies may challenge from their vassals
here's that form of language i expected pray you speak what is your suit
that you look upon me as an humble thing that millions of degrees is placed beneath you for what am i dread sir or what can fall in the whole course of my life that may be worth your care much less your trouble
as the lowly shrub is to the lofty cedar or a molehill to olympus if compared i am to you sir
or suppose the prince which cannot find belief in me forgetting the greatness of his birth and hopes hath thrown an eye of favour on me in me punish that am the cause the rashness of his youth
shall the queen of the inhabitants of the air the eagle that bears thunder on her wings in her angry mood destroy her hopeful young for suffering a wren to perch too near them
such is our disproportion
with what fervour she pleads against herself
for me poor maid i know the prince to be so far above me that my wishes cannot reach him
yet i am so much his creature that to fix him in your wonted grace and favour i'll abjure his sight for ever and betake myself to a religious life where in my prayers i may remember him and ne'er see man more but my ghostly father
will you trust me sir
in truth i'll keep my word or if this fail a little more of fear what may befall him will stop my breath for ever
had you thus argued raises her
as you were yourself and brought as advocates your health and beauty to make way for you no crime of his could put on such a shape but i should look with the eyes of mercy on it
what would i give to see this diamond in her perfect lustre as she was before the clouds of sickness dimm'd it
yet take comfort and as you would obtain remission for his treachery to me cheer your drooping spirits and call the blood again into your cheeks and then plead for him and in such a habit as in your highest hopes you would put on if we were to receive you for our bride
i'll do my best sir
and that best will be a crown of all felicity to me
an upper chamber in charomonte's house
'tis proved in me the curse of human frailty adding to our afflictions makes us know what's good and yet our violent passions force us to follow what is ill
reason assured me it was not safe to shave a lion's skin and that to trifle with a sovereign was to play with lightning yet imperious beauty treading upon the neck of understanding compell'd me to put off my natural shape of loyal duty to disguise myself in the adulterate and cobweb mask of disobedient treachery
where is now my borrow'd greatness or the promised lives of following courtiers echoing my will
in a moment vanish'd
power that stands not on its proper base which is peculiar only to absolute princes falls or rises with their frown or favour
the great duke my master who almost changed me to his other self no sooner takes his beams of comfort from me but i as one unknown or unregarded unpitied suffer
who makes intercession to his mercy for me now
who does remember the service i have done him
not a man and such as spake no language but my lord the favourite of tuscany's grand duke deride my madness
what noise of horses
he looks out at the back window
this back part of my prison allows me liberty to see and know them
yes 'tis he and lodovico and the duchess fiorinda urbin's heir a princess i have slighted yet i wear her favours and to teach me what i am she whom i scorn'd can only mediate for me
this way she makes yet speak to her i dare not and how to make suit to her is a task of as much difficulty
yes thou blessed pledge takes off the ring
of her affection aid me
this supplies the want of pen and ink and this of paper
takes a pane of glass
it must be so and i in my petition concise and pithy
the court before charomonte's house
enter leading in and fior
'tis a goodly pile this
but better by the owner
but most rich in the great states it covers
the duke's pleasure commands us hither
which was laid on us to attend you to it
signior charomonte to see your excellence his guest will think himself most happy
the pane falls down
a pane thrown from the window no wind stirring
and at your feet too fall'n there's something writ on 't
some courtier belike would have it known he wore a diamond
it is directed to the princess fiorinda
we will read it
he whom you pleased to favour is cast down past hope of rising by the great duke's frown if by your gracious means he cannot have a pardon and that got he lives your slave
of men the most distressed of me the most beloved and i will save thee or perish with thee
sure thy fault must be of some prodigious shape if that my prayers and humble intercession to the duke enter and prevail not with him
here he comes delay shall not make less my benefit
what we purpose shall know no change and therefore move we not we were made as properties and what we shall determine of them cannot be call'd rigour but noble justice
when they proved disloyal they were cruel to themselves
the prince that pardons the first affront offer'd to majesty invites a second rendering that power subjects should tremble at contemptible
ingratitude is a monster carolo to be strangled in the birth not to be cherish'd
madam you're happily met with
sir i am an humble suitor to you and the rather am confident of a grant in that your grace when i made choice to be at your devotion vow'd to deny me nothing
to this minute we have confirm'd it
it is sir that you in being gracious to your servant the ne'er sufficiently praised sanazarro that now under your heavy displeasure suffers would be good unto yourself
his services so many and so great your storm of fury calm'd by your better judgment must inform you some little slip for sure it is no more from his loyal duty with your justice cannot make foul his fair deservings
great sir therefore look backward on his former worth and turning your eye from his offence what 'tis i know not and i am confident you will receive him once more into your favour
you say well you are ignorant in the nature of his fault which when you understand as we'll instruct you your pity will appear a charity it being conferr'd on an unthankful man to be repented
he's a traitor madam to you to us to gratitude and in that all crimes are comprehended
if his offence aim'd at me only whatsoe'er it is 'tis freely pardon'd
this compassion in you must make the colour of his guilt more ugly
the honours we have hourly heap'd upon him the titles the rewards to the envy of the old nobility as the common people we now forbear to touch at and will only insist on his gross wrongs to you
you were pleased forgetting both yourself and proper greatness to favour him nay to court him to embrace a happiness which on his knees with joy he should have sued for
who repined not at the grace you did him
yet in recompense of your large bounties the disloyal wretch makes you a stale and what he might be by you scorn'd and derided gives himself up wholly to the service of another
if you can bear this with patience we must say you have not the bitterness of spleen or ireful passions familiar to women
pause upon it and when you seriously have weigh'd his carriage move us again if your reason will allow it his treachery known and then if you continue an advocate for him we perhaps because we would deny you nothing may awake our sleeping mercy
to endure a rival that were equal to me cannot but speak my poverty of spirit but an inferior more yet true love must not know or degrees or distances
lidia may be as far above me in her form as she is in her birth beneath me and what i in sanazarro liked he loves in her
but if i free him now the benefit being done so timely and confirming too my strength and power my soul's best faculties being bent wholly to preserve him must supply me with all i am defective in and bind him my creature ever
it must needs be so nor will i give it o'er thus
does your nephew bear his restraint so constantly as you deliver it to us
in my judgment sir he suffers more for his offence to you than in his fear of what can follow it
for he is so collected and prepared to welcome that you shall determine of him as if his doubts and fears were equal to him
and sure he's not acquainted with much guilt that more laments the telling one untruth under your pardon still for 'twas a fault sir than others that pretend to conscience do their crying secret sins
no more this gloss defends not the corruption of the text
urge it no more
and the others talk aside
i once more must make bold sir to trench upon your patience
i have consider'd my wrongs duly yet that cannot divert my intercession for a man your grace like me once favour'd
i am still a suppliant to you that you would vouchsafe the hearing his defence and that i may with your allowance see and comfort him
then having heard all that he can allege in his excuse for being false to you censure him as you please
you will o'ercome there's no contending with you
pray you enjoy what you desire and tell him he shall have a speedy trial in which we will forbear to sit a judge because our purpose is to rise up his accuser
all increase of happiness wait on cozimo
was it no more
my honour's pawn'd for it
since it is for the service and the safety of the hopeful prince fall what can fall i'll run the desperate hazard
he's no friend to virtue that does decline it
they all come forward and kneel
what sue you for
shall we be ever troubled
do not tempt that anger may consume you
let it sir the loss is less though innocents we perish than that your sister's son should fall unheard under your fury
shall we fear to entreat that grace for him that are your faithful servants which you vouchsafe the count like us a subject
did not we vow till sickness had forsook thy daughter lidia and she appear'd in her perfect health and beauty to plead for him we were deaf to all persuasion
and that hope sir hath wrought a miracle
she is recover'd and if you please to warrant her will bring the penitent prince before you
to enjoy such happiness what would we not dispense with
we all kneel for the prince
nor can it stand with your mercy that are gracious to strangers to be cruel to your own
but art thou certain i shall behold her at the best
if ever she was handsome as it fits not me to say so she is now much better'd
rise thou art but dead if this prove otherwise
lidia appear and feast an appetite almost pined to death with longing expectation to behold thy excellencies thou as beauty's queen shalt censure the detractors
let my nephew be led in triumph under her command we'll have it so and sanazarro tremble to think whom he hath slander'd
we'll retire ourselves a little and prepare to meet a blessing which imagination tells us we are not worthy of and then come forth but with such reverence as if i were myself the priest the sacrifice my heart to offer at the altar of that goodness that must or kill or save me
are not these strange gambols in the duke
great princes have like meaner men their weakness
and may use it without control or check
'tis fit they should their privilege were less else than their subjects'
let them have their humours there's no crossing them
a state room in the same
and can it be your bounties should fall down in showers on my ingratitude or the wrongs your greatness should revenge teach you to pity
what retribution can i make what service pay to your goodness that in some proportion may to the world express i would be thankful
since my engagements are so great that all my best endeavours to appear your creature can but proclaim my wants and what i owe to your magnificence
all debts are discharged in this acknowledgment yet since you please i shall impose some terms of satisfaction for that which you profess yourself obliged for they shall be gentle ones and such as will not i hope afflict you
make me understand great princess what they are and my obedience shall with all cheerful willingness subscribe to what you shall command
i will bind you to make good your promise
first i then enjoin you to love a lady that a noble way truly affects you and that you would take to your protection and care the dukedom of urbin which no more is mine but yours
and that when you have full possession of my person as my fortune you would use me not as a princess but instruct me in the duties of an humble wife for such the privilege of my birth no more remember'd i will be to you
this consented to all injuries are forgotten
i am wretched in having but one life to be employ'd as you please to dispose it
and believe it if it be not already forfeited to the fury of my prince as 'tis your gift with all the faculties of my soul i'll study in what i may to serve you
i am happy enter and in this assurance
what sweet lady's this
'tis lidia madam she fior
nay blush not by my life she is a rare one
and if i were your judge i would not blame you to like and love her
but sir you are mine now and i presume so on your constancy that i dare not be jealous
all thoughts of her are in your goodness buried
pray you sir be comforted your innocence should not know what 'tis to fear and if that you but look on the guards that you have in yourself you cannot
the duke's your uncle sir and though a little incensed against you when he sees your sorrow he must be reconciled
what rugged tartar or cannibal though bathed in human gore but looking on your sweetness would forget his cruel nature and let fall his weapon though then aim'd at your throat
o lidia of maids the honour and your sex's glory
it is not fear to die but to lose you that brings this fever on me
i will now discover to you that which till this minute i durst not trust the air with
ere you knew what power the magic of your beauty had i was enchanted by it liked and loved it my fondness still increasing with my years and flatter'd by false hopes i did attend some blessed opportunity to move the duke with his consent to make you mine but now such is my star cross'd destiny when he beholds you as you are i may as well entreat him give away his crown as to part from a jewel of more value
yet howsoever when you are his duchess and i am turn'd into forgotten dust pray you love my memory i should say more but i'm cut off
that countenance once when it was clothed in smiles show'd like an angel's but now 'tis folded up in clouds of fury 'tis terrible to look on
a while silence your musical tongue and let me feast my eyes with the most ravishing object that they ever gazed on
there's no miniature in her fair face but is a copious theme which would discoursed at large of make a volume
what clear arch'd brows
the lilies contending with the roses in her cheeks who shall most set them off
or unto what can i compare her neck but to a rock of crystal
every limb proportion'd to love's wish and in their neatness add lustre to the riches of her habit not borrow from it
you are pleased to show sir the fluency of your language in advancing a subject much unworthy
by all the vows which lovers offer at the cyprian goddess' altars eloquence itself presuming as you are to speak you would be struck dumb
and what have you deserved then and kneel
wretches you kneel too late that have endeavour'd to spout the poison of your black detraction on this immaculate whiteness
was it malice to her perfections
your highness promised a gracious hearing to the count
and prince too do not make void so just a grant
we will not yet since their accusation must be urged and strongly ere their weak defence have hearing we seat you here as judges to determine of your gross wrongs and ours
seats the ladies in the chairs of state
and now remembering whose deputies you are be neither sway'd or with particular spleen or foolish pity for neither can become you
there's some hope yet since they have such gentle judges
rise and stand forth then and hear with horror to your guilty souls what we will prove against you
could this princess thou enemy to thyself to stoop her high flight of towering greatness to invite thy lowness to look up to it and with nimble wings of gratitude couldst thou forbear to meet it
were her favours boundless in a noble way and warranted by our allowance yet in thy acceptation there appear'd no sign of a modest thankfulness
pray you forbear to press that further 'tis a fault we have already heard and pardon'd
we will then pass over it and briefly touch at that which does concern ourself in which both being equal offenders what we shall speak points indifferently at either
how we raised thee forgetful sanazarro
of our grace to a full possession of power and honours it being too well known we'll not remember
and what thou wert rash youth in expectation to and from which headlong thou hast thrown thyself not florence but all tuscany can witness with admiration
to assure thy hopes we did keep constant to a widow'd bed and did deny ourself those lawful pleasures our absolute power and height of blood allow'd us made both the keys that open'd our heart's secrets and what you spake believed as oracles but you in recompense of this to him that gave you all to whom you owed your being with treacherous lies endeavour'd to conceal this jewel from our knowledge which ourself could only lay just claim to
'tis most true sir
we both confess a guilty cause
is this a beauty fit to be embraced by any subject's arms
can any tire become that forehead but a diadem
or should we grant your being false to us could be excused your treachery to her in seeking to deprive her of that greatness her matchless worth consider'd she was born to must ne'er find pardon
we have spoken ladies like a rough orator that brings more truth than rhetoric to make good his accusation and now expect your sentence
the ladies descend from the state
in your birth sir you were mark'd out the judge of life and death and we that are your subjects to attend with trembling fear your doom
we do resign this chair as only proper to yourself
and since injustice we are lost we fly unto your saving mercy
which sets off a prince much more than rigour
and becomes him when 'tis express'd to such as fell by weakness that being a twin born brother to affection better than wreaths of conquest
we all speak their language mighty sir
you know our temper and therefore with more boldness venture on it and would not our consent to your demands deprive us of a happiness hereafter ever to be despair'd of we perhaps might hearken nearer to you and could wish with some qualification or excuse you might make less the mountains of your crimes and so invite our clemency to feast with you
but you that knew with what impatiency of grief we parted from the fair clarinda our duchess let her memory still be sacred
and with what imprecations on ourself we vow'd not hoping e'er to see her equal ne'er to make trial of a second choice if nature framed not one that did excel her as this maid's beauty prompts us that she does and yet with oaths then mix'd with tears upon her monument we swore our eye should never again be tempted 'tis true and those vows are register'd above something here tells me
carolo thou heard'st us swear
and swear so deeply that if all women's beauties were in this as she's not to be named with the dead duchess nay all their virtues bound up in one story of which mine is scarce an epitome if you should take her as a wife the weight of your perjuries would sink you
if i durst i had told you this before
'tis strong truth carolo and yet what was necessity in us cannot free them from treason
there's your error the prince in care to have you keep your vows made unto heaven vouchsafed to love my daughter
surely massinger intended that his characters should here be understood as speaking the truth
the contrivance by which he exculpates giovanni is a clumsy one but he was anxious to conclude his play and took the first that suggested itself
awkward as it may appear to the reader it has perhaps quite enough dramatic probability to satisfy an audience lid
he told me so indeed sir
and the count averr'd as much to me
you all conspire to force our mercy from us
which given up to aftertimes preserves you unforsworn an honour which will live upon your tomb when your greatness is forgotten
though we know all this is practice and that both are false such reverence we will pay to dead clarinda and to our serious oaths that we are pleased with our own hand to blind our eyes and not know what we understand
here giovanni we pardon thee and take from us in this more than our dukedom love her
as i part with her all thoughts of women fly fast from us
sanazarro we forgive you in your service to this princess merit it
yet let not others that are in trust and grace as you have been by the example of our lenity presume upon their sovereign's clemency
long live great cozimo
sure the duke is in the giving vein they are so loud
come on spouse we have heard all and we will have our boon too
that your grace in remembrance of my share in a dance and that i play'd your part when you should have drunk hard would get this signior's grant to give this damsel to me in the church for we are contracted
in it you shall do your dukedom pleasure
why the whole race of such as can act naturally fools' parts are quite worn out and they that do survive do only zany us and we will bring you if we die not without issue of both sexes such chopping mirth makers as shall preserve perpetual cause of sport both to your grace and your posterity that sad melancholy shall ne'er approach you
we are pleased in it and will pay her portion
may the passage prove of what's presented worthy of your love and favour as was aim'd and we have all that can in compass of our wishes fall
