the camp of near syracuse
why should you droop leosthenes or despair my sister's favour
what before you purchased by courtship and fair language in these wars for from her soul you know she loves a soldier you may deserve by action
good timagoras when i have said my friend think all is spoken that may assure me yours and pray you believe the dreadful voice of war that shakes the city the thundering threats of carthage nor their army raised to make good those threats affright not me
if fair cleora were confirm'd his prize that has the strongest arm and sharpest sword i'd court bellona in her horrid trim as if she were a mistress and bless fortune that offers my young valour to the proof how much i dare do for your sister's love
but when that i consider how averse your noble father great archidamus is and hath ever been to my desires reason may warrant me to doubt and fear what seeds soever i sow in these wars of noble courage his determinate will may blast and give my harvest to another that never toil'd for it
prithee do not nourish these jealous thoughts i am thine and pardon me though i repeat it thy timagoras that for thy sake when the bold theban sued far famed pisander for my sister's love sent him disgraced and discontented home
i wrought my father then and i that stopp'd not in the career of my affection to thee when that renowned worthy that brought with him high birth wealth courage as feed advocates to mediate for him never will consent a fool that only has the shape of man asotus though he be rich cleon's heir shall bear her from thee
in that trust i love
which never shall deceive you
sir the general timoleon by his trumpets hath given warning for a remove
'tis well provide my horse
this slave has a strange aspect
fit for his fortune 'tis a strong limb'd knave my father bought him for my sister's litter
o pride of women
coaches are too common they surfeit in the happiness of peace and ladies think they keep not state enough if for their pomp and ease they are not borne in triumph on men's shoulders
who commands the carthaginian fleet
gisco's their admiral and 'tis our happiness a raw young fellow one never train'd in arms but rather fashion'd to tilt with ladies' lips than crack a lance ravish a feather from a mistress' fan and wear it as a favour
a steel helmet made horrid with a glorious plume will crack his woman's neck
no more of him
the motives that corinth gives us aid
the common danger for sicily being afire she is not safe it being apparent that ambitious carthage that to enlarge her empire strives to fasten an unjust gripe on us that live free lords of syracusa will not end till greece acknowledge her their sovereign
what think you of our general
he's a man trumpets within
of strange and reserved parts but a great soldier
his trumpets call us i'll forbear his character to morrow in the senate house at large he will express himself
so careless we have been my noble lords in the disposing of our own affairs and ignorant in the art of government that now we need a stranger to instruct us
yet we are happy that our neighbour corinth pitying the unjust gripe carthage would lay on syracusa hath vouchsafed to lend us her man of men timoleon to defend our country and our liberties
'tis a favour we are unworthy of and we may blush necessity compels us to receive it
that we that are a populous nation engaged to liberal nature for all blessings an island can bring forth we that have limbs and able bodies shipping arms and treasure the sinews of the war now we are call'd to stand upon our guard cannot produce one fit to be our general
i am old and fat i could say something else
we must obey the time and our occasions ruinous buildings whose bases and foundations are infirm must use supporters we are circled round with danger o'er our heads with sail stretch'd wings destruction hovers and a cloud of mischief ready to break upon us no hope left us that may divert it but our sleeping virtue roused up by brave timoleon
he is expected every hour
the braveries of syracusa among whom my son timagoras leosthenes and asotus your hopeful heir lord cleon two days since rode forth to meet him and attend him to the city every minute we expect to be bless'd with his presence
shouts within then a flourish of trumpets
'tis seconded with loud music
which confirms his wish'd for entrance
let us entertain him with all respect solemnity and pomp a man may merit that comes to redeem us from slavery and oppression
i'll lock up my doors and guard my gold these lads of corinth have nimble fingers and i fear them more being within our walls than those of carthage they are far off
and ladies be it your care to welcome him and his followers with all duty for rest resolved their hands and swords must keep you in that full height of happiness you live a dreadful change else follows
she's studying how to entertain these strangers and to engross them to herself
no more they come
enter in black led in by and followed by and other slaves
it is your seat which with a general suffrage offering the state
as to the supreme magistrate sicily tenders and prays timoleon to accept
such honours to one ambitious of rule or titles whose heaven on earth is placed in his command and absolute power o'er others would with joy and veins swollen high with pride be entertain'd
they take not me for i have ever loved an equal freedom and proclaim'd all such as would usurp on others' liberties rebels to nature to whose bounteous blessings all men lay claim as true legitimate sons but such as have made forfeit of themselves by vicious courses and their birthright lost 'tis not injustice they are mark'd for slaves to serve the virtuous
for myself i know honours and great employments are great burdens and must require an atlas to support them
he that would govern others first should be the master of himself richly endued with depth of understanding height of courage and those remarkable graces which i dare not ascribe unto myself
sir empty men are trumpets of their own deserts but you that are not in opinion but in proof really good and full of glorious parts leave the report of what you are to fame which from the ready tongues of all good men aloud proclaims you
besides you stand bound having so large a field to exercise your active virtues offer'd you to impart your strength to such as need it
'tis confess'd and since you'll have it so such as i am for you and for the liberty of greece i am most ready to lay down my life but yet consider men of syracusa before that you deliver up the power which yet is yours to me to whom 'tis given to an impartial man with whom nor threats nor prayers shall prevail for i must steer an even course
which is desired of all
timophanes my brother for whose death i am tainted in the world and foully tainted in whose remembrance i have ever worn in peace and war this livery of sorrow can witness for me how much i detest tyrannous usurpation
with grief i must remember it for when no persuasion could win him to desist from his bad practice to change the aristocracy of corinth into an absolute monarchy i chose rather to prove a pious and obedient son to my country my best mother than to lend assistance to timophanes though my brother that like a tyrant strove to set his foot upon the city's freedom
'twas a deed deserving rather trophies than reproof
and will be still remember'd to your honour if you forsake not us
if you free sicily from barbarous carthage' yoke it will be said in him you slew a tyrant
but giving way to her invasion not vouchsafing us that fly to your protection aid and comfort 'twill be believed that for your private ends you kill'd a brother
as i then proceed to all posterity may that act be crown'd with a deserved applause or branded with the mark of infamy
stay yet ere i take this seat of justice or engage myself to fight for you abroad or to reform your state at home swear all upon my sword and call the gods of sicily to witness the oath you take that whatsoe'er i shall propound for safety of your commonwealth not circumscribed or bound in shall by you be willingly obey'd
so may we prosper as we obey in all things
and observe all your commands as oracles
do not repent it
he ask'd not our consent
he's a clown i warrant him
he thinks women no part of the republic
he shall find we are a commonwealth
the less your honour
first then a word or two but without bitterness and yet mistake me not i am no flatterer concerning your ill government of the state in which the greatest noblest and most rich stand in the first file guilty
you have not as good patriots should do studied the public good but your particular ends factious among yourselves preferring such to offices and honours as ne'er read the elements of saving policy but deeply skill'd in all the principles that usher to destruction
your senate house which used not to admit a man however popular to stand at the helm of government whose youth was not made glorious by action whose experience crown'd with gray hairs gave warrant to his counsels heard and received with reverence is now fill'd with green heads that determine of the state over their cups or when their sated lusts afford them leisure or supplied by those who rising from base arts and sordid thrift are eminent for their wealth not for their wisdom which is the reason that to hold a place in council which was once esteem'd an honour and a reward for virtue hath quite lost lustre and reputation and is made a mercenary purchase
and to the purpose
from whence it proceeds that the treasure of the city is engross'd by a few private men the public coffers hollow with want and they that will not spare one talent for the common good to feed the pride and bravery of their wives consume in plate in jewels and superfluous slaves what would maintain an army
we thought we were forgot
but it appears you will be treated of
yet in this plenty and fat of peace your young men ne'er were train'd in martial discipline and your ships unrigg'd rot in the harbour no defence prepared but thought unuseful as if that the gods indulgent to your sloth had granted you a perpetuity of pride and pleasure no change fear'd or expected
now you find that carthage looking on your stupid sleeps and dull security was invited to invade your territories
you have made us see sir to our shame the country's sickness now from you as from a careful and a wise physician we do expect the cure
old fester'd sores must be lanced to the quick and cauterized which borne with patience after i'll apply soft unguents
for the maintenance of the war it is decreed all moneys in the hand of private men shall instantly be brought to the public treasury
the cure is worse than the disease i'll never yield to 't what could the enemy though victorious inflict more on us
all that my youth hath toil'd for purchased with industry and preserved with care forced from me in a moment
this rough course will never be allow'd of
if you refuse the first means that is offer'd to give you health no hope's left to recover your desperate sickness
do you prize your muck above your liberties
and rather choose to be made bondmen than to part with that to which already you are slaves
or can it be probable in your flattering apprehensions you can capitulate with the conquerors and keep that yours which they come to possess and while you kneel in vain will ravish from you
but take your own ways brood upon your gold
sacrifice to your idol and preserve the prey entire and merit the report of careful stewards yield a just account to your proud masters who with whips of iron will force you to give up what you conceal or tear it from your throats adorn your walls with persian hangings wrought of gold and pearl cover the floors on which they are to tread with costly median silks perfume the rooms with cassia and amber where they are to feast and revel while like servile grooms you wait upon their trenchers feed their eyes with massy plate until your cupboards crack with the weight that they sustain and to perfect their entertainment offer up your sons and able men for slaves while you that are unfit for labour are spurn'd out to starve unpitied in some desert no friend by whose sorrow may spare one compassionate tear in the remembrance of what once you were
observe how old cleon shakes as if in picture he had shown him what he was to suffer
i am sick the man speaks poniards and diseases
i never shall recover
if a virgin whose speech was ever yet usher'd with fear one knowing modesty and humble silence to be the choicest ornaments of our sex in the presence of so many reverend men struck dumb with terror and astonishment presume to clothe her thought in vocal sounds let her find pardon
first to you great sir a bashful maid's thanks and her zealous prayers wing'd with pure innocence bearing them to heaven for all prosperity that the gods can give to one whose piety must exact their care thus low i offer
'tis a happy omen
rise blest one and speak boldly
on my virtue i am thy warrant from so clear a spring sweet rivers ever flow
then thus to you my noble father and these lords to whom i next owe duty no respect forgotten to you my brother and these bold young men such i would have them that are or should he the city's sword and target of defence
to all of you i speak and if a blush steal on my cheeks it is shown to reprove your paleness willingly i would not say your cowardice or fear think you all treasure hid in the bowels of the earth or shipwreck'd in neptune's wat'ry kingdom can hold weight when liberty and honour fill one scale triumphant justice sitting on the beam
or dare you but imagine that your gold is too dear a salary for such as hazard their blood and lives in your defence
for me an ignorant girl bear witness heaven
so far i prize a soldier that to give him pay with such devotion as our flamens offer their sacrifices at the holy altar i do lay down these jewels will make sale of my superfluous wardrobe to supply the meanest of their wants
lays down her jewels &c
the rest follow her example
we are shown to our shame what we in honour should have taught others
such a fair example must needs be follow'd
ever my dear sister but now our family's glory
were she deform'd the virtues of her mind would force a stoic to sue to be her servant
i must yield and though my heart blood part with it i will deliver in my wealth
i would say something but the truth is i know not what
we have money and men must now be thought on
we can press of labourers in the country men inured to cold and heat ten thousand
or if need be enrol our slaves lusty and able varlets and fit for service
they shall go for me i will not pay and fight too
o stain of honour
once more sir your pardon and to their shames let me deliver what i know in justice you may speak
most gladly i could not wish my thoughts a better organ than your tongue to express them
for age may qualify though not excuse the backwardness of these able young men
yet now your country's liberty's at the stake honour and glorious triumph made the garland for such as dare deserve them a rich feast prepared by victory of immortal viands not for base men but such as with their swords dare force admittance and will be her guests and can you coldly suffer such rewards to be proposed to labourers and slaves
while you that are born noble to whom these valued at their best rate are next to horses or other beasts of carriage cry aim
like idle lookers on till their proud worth make them become your masters
by my hopes there's fire and spirit enough in this to make thersites valiant
no far far be it from you let these of meaner quality contend who can endure most labour plough the earth and think they are rewarded when their toil brings home a fruitful harvest to their lords let them prove good artificers and serve you for use and ornament but not presume to touch at what is noble
if you think them unworthy to taste of those cates you feed on or wear such costly garments will you grant them the privilege and prerogative of great minds which you were born to
honour won in war and to be styled preservers of their country are titles fit for free and generous spirits and not for bondmen
had i been born a man and such ne'er dying glories made the prize to bold heroic courage by diana i would not to my brother nay my father be bribed to part with the least piece of honour i should gain in this action
she's inspired or in her speaks the genius of your country to fire your blood in her defence i am rapt with the imagination
noble maid timoleon is your soldier and will sweat drops of his best blood but he will bring home triumphant conquest to you
let me wear your colours lady and though youthful heats that look no further than your outward form are long since buried in me while i live i am a constant lover of your mind that does transcend all precedents
'tis an honour gives her scarf
and so i do receive it
i am for the journey
may all diseases sloth and luxury bring fall upon him that stays at home
though old i will be there in person
so will i methinks i am not what i was her words have made me younger by a score of years than i was when i came hither
i shall never make a good soldier and therefore desire to be excused at home
'tis my suit too
have your desires you would be burthens to us
lead fairest to the temple first we'll pay a sacrifice to the gods for good success for all great actions the wish'd course do run that are with their allowance well begun
exeunt all but and mar
stay cimbrio and gracculo
meet me to morrow night near to the grove neighbouring the east part of the city
and bring the rest of our condition with you i've something to impart may break our fetters if you dare second me
a cart rope shall not bind me at home
think on 't and prosper
a room in archidamus's house
enter with gorgets and archid
so so 'tis well how do i look
i shrink not in the shoulders though i'm old i'm tough steel to the back i have not wasted my stock of strength in featherbeds here's an arm too there's stuff in 't and i hope will use a sword as well as any beardless boy of you all
i'm glad to see you sir so well prepared to endure the travail of the war
i shall endure when some of you keep your cabins for all your flaunting feathers nay leosthenes you are welcome too all friends and fellows now
leave these compliments they stink in a soldier's mouth i could be merry for now my gown's off farewell gravity
i fear ye when you come to the test
old stories tell us there's a month call'd october which brings in cold weather there are trenches too 'tis rumour'd in which to stand all night to the knees in water in gallants breeds the toothach there's a sport too named lying perdue do you mark me
'tis a game which you must learn to play at now in these seasons and choice variety of exercises nay i come to you and fasts not for devotion your rambling youngster feels strange alterations and in a frosty morning
enter and you have cut off my discourse but i will perfect my lecture in the camp
come we are stay'd for the general's afire for a remove and longs to be in action
'tis my wish too
we must part nay no tears my best cleora i shall melt too and that were ominous
millions of blessings on thee
all that's mine i give up to thy charge and sirrah look to you with that care and reverence observe her which you would pay to me
a kiss farewell girl
peace wait upon you fair one
'twere impertinence to wish you to be careful of your honour that ever keep in pay a guard about you of faithful virtues farewell
friend i leave you to wipe our kisses off i know that lovers part with more circumstance and ceremony which i give way to
'tis a noble favour for which i ever owe you
we are alone but how i should begin or in what language speak the unwilling word of parting from you i am yet to learn
and still continue ignorant for i must be most cruel to myself if i should teach you
yet it must be spoken or you will chide my slackness
you have fired me with the heat of noble action to deserve you and the least spark of honour that took life from your sweet breath still fann'd by it and cherish'd must mount up in a glorious flame or i am much unworthy
may it not burn here and as a seamark serve to guide true lovers safe from the rocks of passion to the harbour of pure affection
rising up an example which aftertimes shall witness to our glory first took from us beginning
'tis a happiness my duty to my country and mine honour cannot consent to besides add to these it was your pleasure fortified by persuasion and strength of reason for the general good that i should go
i then was witty to plead against myself and mine eye fix'd upon the hill of honour ne'er descended to look into the vale of certain dangers through which you were to cut your passage to it
i'll stay at home then
no that must not be for so to serve my own ends and to gain a petty wreath myself i rob you of a certain triumph which must fall upon you or virtue's turn'd a handmaid to blind fortune
how is my soul divided
to confirm you in the opinion of the world most worthy to be beloved with me you're at the height and can advance no further i must send you to court the goddess of stern war who if she see you with my eyes will ne'er return you but grow enamour'd of you
and what i offer you you must vouchsafe me or i am wretched
all the dangers that i can encounter in the war are trifles my enemies abroad to be contemn'd the dreadful foes that have the power to hurt me i leave at home with you
nay in you in every part about you they are arm'd to fight against me
there's no perfection that you are mistress of but musters up a legion against me and all sworn to my destruction
but true sweet excess of love can work such miracles
upon this ivory forehead are intrench'd ten thousand rivals and these suns command supplies from all the world on pain to forfeit their comfortable beams these ruby lips a rich exchequer to assure their pay this hand sibylla's golden bough to guard them through hell and horror to the elysian springs which who'll not venture for
and should i name such as the virtues of your mind invite their numbers would be infinite
can you think i may be tempted
you were never proved
for me i have conversed with you no further than would become a brother
i ne'er tuned loose notes to your chaste ears or brought rich presents for my artillery to batter down the fortress of your honour i never practised the cunning and corrupting arts they study that wander in the wild maze of desire honest simplicity and truth were all the agents i employ'd and when i came to see you it was with that reverence as i beheld the altars of the gods and love that came along with me was taught to leave his arrows and his torch behind quench'd in my fear to give offence
and 'twas that modesty that took me and preserves me like a fresh rose in mine own natural sweetness which sullied with the touch of impure hands loses both scent and beauty
but cleora when i am absent as i must go from you such is the cruelty of my fate and leave you unguarded to the violent assaults of loose temptations when the memory of my so many years of love and service is lost in other objects when you are courted by such as keep a catalogue of their conquests won upon credulous virgins when nor father is here to owe you brother to advise you nor your poor servant by to keep such off by love instructed how to undermine and blow your constancy up when your weak senses at once assaulted shall conspire against you and play the traitors to your soul your virtue how can you stand
'faith though you fall and i the judge before whom you then stood accused i should acquit you
will you then confirm that love and jealousy though of different natures must of necessity be twins the younger created only to defeat the elder and spoil him of his birthright
but being to part i will not chide i will not nor with one syllable or tear express how deeply i am wounded with the arrows of your distrust but when that you shall hear at your return how i have borne myself and what an austere penance i take on me to satisfy your doubts when like a vestal i show you to your shame the fire still burning committed to my charge by true affection the people joining with you in the wonder when by the glorious splendour of my sufferings the prying eyes of jealousy are struck blind the monster too that feeds on fears e'en starved for want of seeming matter to accuse me expect leosthenes a sharp reproof from my just anger
what will you do
obey me or from this minute you are a stranger to me and do 't without reply
all seeing sun thou witness of my innocence thus i close mine eyes against thy comfortable light 'till the return of this distrustful man
now bind them sure nay do 't he binds her eyes with her scarf
if uncompell'd i loose this knot until the hands that made it be pleased to untie it may consuming plagues fall heavy on me
pray you guide me to your lips
this kiss when you come back shall be a virgin to bid you welcome nay i have not done yet i will continue dumb and you once gone no accent shall come from me
now to my chamber my tomb if you miscarry there i'll spend my hours in silent mourning and thus much shall be reported of me to my glory and you confess it whether i live or die my constancy triumphs o'er your jealousy
a room in cleon's house
enter driving in asot
hold good young master for pity's sake
now am i in my kingdom who says i am not valiant
i begin to frown again quake villain
so i do sir your looks are agues to me
are they so sir
'slight if i had them at this bay that flout me and say i look like a sheep and an ass i'd make them feel that i am a lion
do not roar sir as you are a valiant beast but do you know why you use me thus
i'll beat thee a little more then study for a reason
i have it one brake a jest on me and then i swore because i durst not strike him when i came home that i would break thy head
plague on his mirth
i am sure i mourn for 't
remember too i charge you to teach my horse good manners yet this morning as i rode to take the air the untutor'd jade threw me and kick'd me
i thank him for 't
i say sir i will teach him to hold his heels if you will rule your fingers
i'll think upon 't
i am bruised to jelly better be a dog than slave to a fool or coward
here's my mother enter and she is chastising too how brave we live that have our slaves to beat to keep us in breath when we want exercise
careless creature striking her
look to 't if a curl fall or wind or sun take my complexion off i will not leave one hair upon thine head
here's a second show of the family of pride
fie on these wars
i'm starved for want of action
when were you with your mistress fair cleora
two days sithence but she's so coy forsooth that ere i can speak a penn'd speech i have bought and studied for her her woman calls her away
here's a dull thing
where are you wife
i fain would go abroad but cannot find my slaves that bear my litter i am tired
your shoulder son nay sweet thy hand too a turn or two in the garden and then to supper and so to bed
never to rise i hope more
a grove near the walls of syracuse
enter and a table set out with wine &c
'twill take i warrant thee
you may do your pleasure but in my judgment better to make use of the present opportunity
more wine prithee drink hard friend and when we're hot whatever i propound enter and other slaves
men of your words all welcome
slaves use no ceremony sit down here's a health
let it run round fill every man his glass
we look for no waiters this is wine
the better strong lusty wine drink deep this juice will make us as free as our lords
but if they find we taste it we are condemn'd to the quarry during life without hope of redemption
for that we'll talk anon another rouse
we lose time drinks
when our low blood's wound up a little higher i'll offer my design nay we are cold yet these glasses contain nothing do me right takes the bottle
as e'er you hope for liberty
'tis done bravely how do you feel yourselves now
i begin to have strange conundrums in my head
and i to loathe base water
i would be hang'd in peace now for one month of such holidays
an age boys and yet defy the whip if you are men or dare believe you have souls
we are no brokers
our lords are no gods grac
they are devils to us i am sure
but subject to cold hunger and diseases
equal nature fashion'd us all in one mould
the bear serves not the bear nor the wolf the wolf 'twas odds of strength in tyrants that pluck'd the first link from the golden chain with which that bound in the world
why then since we are taught by their examples to love our liberty if not command should the strong serve the weak the fair deform'd ones
or such as know the cause of things pay tribute to ignorant fools
all's but the outward gloss and politic form that does distinguish us
cimbrio thou art a strong man if in place of carrying burthens thou hadst been train'd up in martial discipline thou might'st have proved a general fit to lead and fight for sicily as fortunate as timoleon
a little fighting will serve a general's turn
thou gracculo hast fluency of language quick conceit and i think cover'd with a senator's robe formally set on the bench thou wouldst appear as brave a senator
would i had lands or money to buy a place
and if i did not sleep on the bench with the drowsiest of them play with my chain look on my watch and wear a state beard with my barber's help rank with them in their most choice peculiar gifts degrade me and put me to drink water again which now i have tasted wine were poison
'tis spoke nobly and like a gownman none of these i think too but would prove good burghers
the fools are modest i know their insides here's an ill faced fellow but that will not be seen in a dark shop if he did not in a month learn to outswear in the selling of his wares the cunning'st tradesman in syracuse i have no skill
here's another observe but what a cozening look he has
hold up thy head man
if for drawing gallants into mortgages for commodities cheating heirs with your new counterfeit gold thread and gumm'd velvets he does not transcend all that went before him call in his patent
is 't not pity then men of such eminent virtues should be slaves
'tis your folly daring men command and make their fates
say at this instant i mark'd you out a way to liberty possess'd you of those blessings our proud lords so long have surfeited in and what is sweetest arm you with power by strong hand to revenge your stripes your unregarded toil the pride the insolence of such as tread upon your patient sufferings fill your famish'd mouths with the fat and plenty of the land redeem you from the dark vale of servitude and seat you upon a hill of happiness what would you do to purchase this and more
any thing to burn a church or two and dance by the light on 't were but a may game
i have a father living but if the cutting of his throat could work this he should excuse me
i would cut mine own rather than miss it so i might but have a taste on 't ere i die
be resolute men you shall run no such hazard nor groan under the burden of such crying sins
do not torment us with expectation
thus then our proud masters and all the able freemen of the city are gone unto the wars poliph
old men and such as can make no resistance are only left at home grac
and the proud young fool my master if this take i'll hamper him
their arsenal their treasure 's in our power if we have hearts to seize them
if our lords fall in the present action the whole country's ours say they return victorious we have means to keep the town against them at the worst to make our own conditions
if you dare break up their iron chests banquet in their rich halls and carve yourselves of all delights and pleasures you have been barr'd from with one voice cry with me liberty
go then and take possession use all freedom but shed no blood
so this is well begun but not to be commended till 't be done
a gallery in archidamus's house
why think you that i plot against myself
fear nothing you are safe these thick skinn'd slaves i use as instruments to serve my ends pierce not my deep designs nor shall they dare to lift an arm against you
but turbulent spirits raised beyond themselves with ease are not so soon laid they oft prove dangerous to him that call'd them up
'tis true in what is rashly undertook
long since i have consider'd seriously their natures proceeded with mature advice and know i hold their will and faculties in more awe than i can do my own
now for their licence and riot in the city i can make a just defence and use it may appear too a politic prevention of such ills as might with greater violence and danger hereafter be attempted though some smart for 't it matters not however i'm resolved and sleep you with security
holds cleora constant to her rash vow
beyond belief to me that see her hourly it seems a fable
by signs i guess at her commands and serve them with silence such her pleasure is made known by holding her fair hand thus
she eats little sleeps less as i imagine once a day i lead her to this gallery where she walks some half a dozen turns and having offer'd to her absent saint a sacrifice of sighs she points back to her prison
guide her hither and make her understand the slaves' revolt and with your utmost eloquence enlarge their insolence and wrongs done in the city
forget not too i am their chief and tell her you strongly think my extreme dotage on her as i'm marullo caused this sudden uproar to gain possession of her
punctually i will discharge my part
o sir i sought you there's such variety of all disorders among the slaves answer'd with crying howling by the citizens and their wives such a confusion in a word not to tire you as i think the like was never read of
this is some revenge for my disgrace
but sir i fear if your authority restrain them not they'll fire the city or kill one another they are so apt to outrage neither know i whether you wish it and came therefore to acquaint you with so much
i will among them but must not long be absent
why think you that i plot against myself
the plot opens here with wonderful address and the succeeding conference or rather scene between pisander and cleora is inimitably beautiful
a room in the same
they are at our gates my heart
affrights and horrors increase each minute
no way left to save us no flattering hope to comfort us or means but miracle to redeem us from base wrongs and lawless rapine
are there gods yet suffer such innocent sweetness to be made the spoil of brutish violence
and of these rebel slaves he that should offer up his life to guard you marullo cursed marullo your own bondman purchased to serve you and fed by your favours nay start not it is he he the grand captain of these libidinous beasts that have not left one cruel act undone that barbarous conquest yet ever practised in a captive city he doting on your beauty and to have fellows in his foul sin hath raised these mutinous slaves
wring not your hands 'tis bootless use the means that may preserve you
'tis no crime to break a vow when you are forced to it show your face and with the majesty of commanding beauty strike dead his loose affections if that fail give liberty to your tongue and use entreaties there cannot be a breast of flesh and blood or heart so made of flint but must receive impression from your words or eyes so stern but from the clear reflection of your tears must melt and bear them company
will you not do these good offices to yourself
poor i then can only weep your fortune
enter speaking at the door
he that advances a foot beyond this comes upon my sword you have had your ways disturb not mine
speak gently her fears may kill her else
now love inspire me
still shall this canopy of envious night obscure my suns of comfort
and those dainties of purest white and red which i take in at my greedy eyes denied my famish'd senses
the organs of your hearing yet are open and you infringe no vow though you vouchsafe to give them warrant to convey unto your understanding parts the story of a tortured and despairing lover whom not fortune but affection marks your slave shake not best lady
for believe 't you are as far from danger as i am from force all violence i shall offer tends no further than to relate my sufferings which i dare not presume to do till by some gracious sign you show you are pleased to hear me
if you are hold forth your right hand
holds forth her right hand
so 'tis done and i with my glad lips seal humbly on your robe my soul's thanks for the favour i forbear to tell you who i am what wealth what honours i made exchange of to become your servant and though i knew worthy leosthenes for sure he must be worthy for whose love you have endured so much to be my rival when rage and jealousy counsell'd me to kill him which then i could have done with much more ease than now in fear to grieve you i dare speak it love seconded with duty boldly told me the man i hated fair cleora favour'd and that was his protection
see she bows her head in sign of thankfulness
he removed by the occasion of the war my fires increasing by being closed and stopp'd up frantic affection prompted me to do something in his absence that might deliver you into my power which you see is effected and even now when my rebellious passions chide my dulness and tell me how much i abuse my fortunes now it is in my power to bear you hence starts
nay fear not madam true love is a servant but brutish lust a tyrant only thus much be pleased i may speak in my own dear cause and think it worthy your consideration i have loved truly cannot say deserved since duty must not take the name of merit that i so far prize your content before all blessings that my hope can fashion to me that willingly i entertain despair and for your sake embrace it for i know this opportunity lost by no endeavour the like can be recover'd
to conclude forget not that i lose myself to save you for what can i expect but death and torture the war being ended
and what is a task would trouble hercules to undertake i do deny you to myself to give you a pure unspotted present to my rival
i have said if it distaste not best of virgins
reward my temperance with some lawful favour though you contemn my person
kneels then pulls off her glove and offers her hand to timand
see she kneels and seems to call upon the gods to pay the debt she owes your virtue to perform which as a sure pledge of friendship she vouchsafes you her fair right hand
i am paid for all my sufferings
now when you please pass to your private chamber my love and duty faithful guards shall keep you from all disturbance and when you are sated with thinking of leosthenes as a fee due to my service spare one sigh for me
makes a low courtesy as she goes off
a room in cleon's house
enter leading in an ape's habit with a chain about his neck in corisca's clothes she bearing up her train
you were ever a brainless ass but if this hold i'll teach you to come aloft and do tricks like an ape
your morning's lesson if you miss asot
what for the carthaginians
what for ourself your lord
gives him an apple
not kiss your paw
was ever lady the first day of her honour so waited on by a wrinkled crone
she looks now without her painting curling and perfumes like the last day of january
so stand there like an image if you stir till with a quarter of a look i call you you know what follows
o what am i fallen to
but 'tis a punishment for my cruel pride justly return'd upon me
how dost thou like thy ladyship zanthia
very well and bear it with as much state as your lordship
give me thy hand let us like conquering romans walk in triumph our captives following then mount our tribunals and make the slaves our footstools
are your hands clean minion
she and i have changed our parts she does what she forced me to do in her reign and i must practise it in mine
'tis justice here come more
discover to a drachma or i will famish thee
i am pined already
spare the old jade he's founder'd
cut his throat then and hang him out for a scarecrow
you have all your wishes in your revenge and i have mine
you see i use no tyranny once i was her slave and in requital of her courtesies having made one another free we are married and if you wish us joy join with us in a dance at our wedding
agreed for i have thought of a most triumphant one which shall express we are lords and these our slaves
but we shall want a woman
no here's jane of apes shall serve carry your body swimming
i have placed it in yon window
music and then a dance
well done on all sides
i have prepared a banquet let's drink and cool us
wait here you have been tired with feasting learn to fast now
i'll have an apple for jack and may be some scraps may fall to your share
whom can we accuse but ourselves for what we suffer
thou art just thou all creating power
and misery instructs me now that yesterday acknowledged no deity beyond my pride and pleasure there is a heaven above us that looks down with the eyes of justice upon such as number those blessings freely given in the accompt of their poor merits else it could not be now miserable i to please whose palate the elements were ransack'd yet complain'd of nature as not liberal enough in her provision of rarities to soothe my taste and pamper my proud flesh should wish in vain for bread
yes i do wish too for what i fed my dogs with
i that forgot i was made of flesh and blood and thought the silk spun by the diligent worm out of their entrails too coarse to clothe me and the softest down too hard to sleep on that disdain'd to look on virtue being in rags that from my servants expected adoration am made justly the scorn of my own bondwoman
i know i cannot last long that's all my comfort
what a true mirror were this sad spectacle for secure greatness
here they that never see themselves but in the glass of servile flattery might behold the weak foundation upon which they build their trust in human frailty
happy are those that knowing in their births they are subject to uncertain change are still prepared and arm'd for either fortune a rare principle and with much labour learn'd in wisdom's school
for as these bondmen by their actions show that their prosperity like too large a sail for their small bark of judgment sinks them with a fore right gale of liberty ere they reach the port they long to touch at so these wretches swollen with the false opinion of their worth and proud of blessings left them not acquired that did believe they could with giant arms fathom the earth and were above their fates those borrow'd helps that did support them vanish'd fall of themselves and by unmanly suffering betray their proper weakness and make known their boasted greatness was lent not their own
o for some meat
we forgot when we drew out intemperate feasts till midnight their hunger was not thought on nor their watchings nor did we hold ourselves served to the height but when we did exact and force their duties beyond their strength and power
we pay for 't now re enter and drunk and quarrelling
do not hold me not kiss the bride
take heed i've news will cool this heat and make you remember what you were
send off these and then i'll tell you
what would you impart
what must invite you to stand upon your guard and leave your feasting our masters are victorious
within a day's march of the city flesh'd with spoil and proud of conquest the armado sunk the carthaginian admiral hand to hand slain by leosthenes
i feel the whip upon my back already
every man seek a convenient tree and hang himself
better die once than live an age to suffer new tortures every hour
say we submit and yield us to their mercy
can you flatter yourselves with such false hopes
or dare you think that your imperious lords that never fail'd to punish with severity petty slips in your neglect of labour may be won to pardon those licentious outrages which noble enemies forbear to practise upon the conquer'd
we have gone too far to think now of retiring in our courage and daring lies our safety if you are not slaves in your abject minds as in your fortunes since to die is the worst better expose our naked breasts to their keen swords and sell our lives with the most advantage than to trust in a forestall'd remission or yield up our bodies to the furnace of their fury thrice heated with revenge
you led us on
and 'tis but justice you should bring us off
and we expect it
hear then and obey me and i will either save you or fall with you
man the walls strongly and make good the ports boldly deny their entrance and rip up your grievances and what compell'd you to this desperate course if they disdain to hear of composition we have in our powers their aged fathers children and their wives who to preserve themselves must willingly make intercession for us
'tis not time now to talk but do a glorious end or freedom is now proposed us stand resolved for either and like good fellows live or die together
the country near syracuse
the camp of enter and timag
i am so far from envy i am proud you have outstripp'd me in the race of honour
o 'twas a glorious day and bravely won
your bold performance gave such lustre to timoleon's wise directions as the army rests doubtful to whom they stand most engaged for their so great success
the gods first honour'd the glory be the general's 'tis far from me to be his rival
you abuse your fortune to entertain her choice and gracious favours with a contracted brow plumed victory is truly painted with a cheerful look equally distant from proud insolence and base dejection
o timagoras you only are acquainted with the cause that loads my sad heart with a hill of lead whose ponderous weight neither my new got honour assisted by the general applause the soldier crowns it with nor all war's glories can lessen or remove and would you please with fit consideration to remember how much i wrong'd cleora's innocence with my rash doubts and what a grievous penance she did impose upon her tender sweetness to pluck away the vulture jealousy that fed upon my liver you cannot blame me but call it a fit justice on myself though i resolve to be a stranger to the thought of mirth or pleasure
you have redeem'd the forfeit of your fault with such a ransom of honourable action as my sister must of necessity confess her sufferings weigh'd down by your fair merits and when she views you like a triumphant conqueror carried through the streets of syracusa the glad people pressing to meet you and the senators contending who shall heap most honours on you the oxen crown'd with garlands led before you appointed for the sacrifice and the altars smoking with thankful incense to the gods the soldiers chanting loud hymns to your praise the windows fill'd with matrons and with virgins throwing upon your head as you pass by the choicest flowers and silently invoking the queen of love with their particular vows to be thought worthy of you can cleora though in the glass of self love she behold her best deserts but with all joy acknowledge what she endured was but a noble trial you made of her affection
and her anger rising from your too amorous cares soon drench'd in lethe and forgotten
if those glories you so set forth were mine they might plead for me but i can lay no claim to the least honour which you with foul injustice ravish from her
her beauty in me wrought a miracle taught me to aim at things beyond my power which her perfections purchased and gave to me from her free bounties she inspired me with that valour which i dare not call mine own and from the fair reflection of her mind my soul received the sparkling beams of courage
she from the magazine of her proper goodness stock'd me with virtuous purposes sent me forth to trade for honour and she being the owner of the bark of my adventures i must yield her a just account of all as fits a factor
and howsoever others think me happy and cry aloud i have made a prosperous voyage one frown of her dislike at my return which as a punishment for my fault i look for strikes dead all comfort
these fears are needless she cannot must not shall not be so cruel
a free confession of a fault wins pardon but being seconded by desert commands it
the general is your own and sure my father repents his harshness for myself i am ever your creature
one day shall be happy in your triumph and your marriage
may it prove so with her consent and pardon
ever touching on that harsh string
she is your own and you without disturbance seize on what's your due
a room in archidamus's house
she has her health then
yes sir and as often as i speak of you lends attentive ear to all that i deliver nor seems tired though i dwell long on the relation of your sufferings for her heaping praise on praise on the unequall'd temperance and command you hold o'er your affections
to my wish have you acquainted her with the defeature of the carthaginians and with what honours leosthenes comes crown'd home with
and how does she receive it
as i guess with a seeming kind of joy but yet appears not transported or proud of his happy fortune
but when i tell her of the certain ruin you must encounter with at their arrival in syracusa and that death with torments must fall upon you which you yet repent not esteeming it a glorious martyrdom and a reward of pure unspotted love preserved in the white robe of innocence though she were in your power and still spurr'd on by powerful love you rather chose to suffer the fury of your lord than that she should be grieved or tainted in her reputation mar
pities she my misfortune
she express'd all signs of sorrow which her vow observed could witness a grieved heart
at the first hearing she fell upon her face rent her fair hair her hands held up to heaven and vented sighs in which she silently seem'd to complain of heaven's injustice
'tis enough wait carefully and on all watch'd occasions continue speech and discourse of me 'tis time must work her
i'll not be wanting but still strive to serve you
now poliphron the news
the conquering army is within ken
how brook the slaves the object
cheerfully yet they do refuse no labour and seem to scoff at danger 'tis your presence that must confirm them with a full consent you are chosen to relate the tyranny of our proud masters and what you subscribe to they gladly will allow of or hold out to the last man
i'll instantly among them
if we prove constant to ourselves good fortune will not i hope forsake us
'tis our best refuge
the two words were used indiscriminately by our old writers
before the walls of syracuse
thus far we are return'd victorious crown'd with wreaths triumphant famine blood and death banish'd your peaceful confines and bring home security and peace
'tis therefore fit that such as boldly stood the shock of war and with the dear expense of sweat and blood have purchased honour should with pleasure reap the harvest of their toil and we stand bound out of the first file of the best deservers though all must be consider'd to their merits to think of you leosthenes that stand and worthily most dear in our esteem for your heroic valour
when i look on the labour of so many men and ages this well built city not long since design'd to spoil and rapine by the favour of the gods and you their ministers preserved i cannot in my height of joy but offer these tears for a glad sacrifice
or are they overwhelm'd with the excess of comfort that flows to them
we receive a silent entertainment
i long since expected that the virgins and the matrons the old men striving with their age the priests carrying the images of their gods before them should have met us with procession
the gates are shut against us
and upon the walls arm'd men seem to defy us
enter above on the walls and other slaves
i should know these faces they are our slaves
open the ports and play not with an anger that will consume you
this is above wonder
our bondmen stand against us
some such things we were in man's remembrance
the slaves are turn'd lords of the town or so nay be not angry perhaps upon good terms giving security you will be quiet men we may allow you some lodgings in our garrets or outhouses your great looks cannot carry it
the truth is we have been bold to rifle your rich chests been busy with your wardrobes
can we endure this
a caudle for the gentleman he'll die o' the pip else
are you turn'd stone
hold parley with our bondmen
force our entrance then villains expect timol
you wear men's shapes and if like men you have reason show a cause that leads you to this desperate course which must end in your destruction
that as please the fates but we vouchsafe speak captain
bay'd by our own curs
take heed you be not worried
we are sharp set
briefly thus then since i must speak for all your tyranny drew us from our obedience
happy those times when lords were styled fathers of families and not imperious masters
when they number'd their servants almost equal with their sons or one degree beneath them
when their labours were cherish'd and rewarded and a period set to their sufferings when they did not press their duties or their wills beyond the power and strength of their performance
all things order'd with such decorum as wise lawmakers from each well govern'd private house derived the perfect model of a commonwealth
humanity then lodged in the hearts of men and thankful masters carefully provided for creatures wanting reason
the noble horse that in his fiery youth from his wide nostrils neigh'd courage to his rider and brake through groves of opposed pikes bearing his lord safe to triumphant victory old or wounded was set at liberty and freed from service
the athenian mules that from the quarry drew marble hew'd for the temples of the gods the great work ended were dismiss'd and fed at the public cost nay faithful dogs have found their sepulchres but man to man more cruel appoints no end to the sufferings of his slave since pride stepp'd in and riot and o'erturn'd this goodly frame of concord teaching masters to glory in the abuse of such as are brought under their command who grown unuseful are less esteem'd than beasts
this you have practised practised on us with rigour this hath forced us to shake our heavy yokes off and if redress of these just grievances be not granted us we'll right ourselves and by strong hand defend what we are now possess'd of
and not leave one house unfired
or throat uncut of those we have in our power
nor will we fall alone you shall buy us dearly
what are your demands
a general pardon first for all offences committed in your absence
liberty to all such as desire to make return into their countries and to those that stay a competence of land freely allotted to each man's proper use no lord acknowledged lastly with your consent to choose them wives out of your families
let the city sink first
and ruin seize on all ere we subscribe to such conditions
carthage though victorious could not have forced more from us
scale the walls capitulate after
he that wins the top first shall wear a mural wreath
each to his place
or death or victory
charge them home and fear not
re enter and senators
we wrong ourselves and we are justly punish'd to deal with bondmen as if we encounter'd an equal enemy
they fight like devils and run upon our swords as if their breasts were proof beyond their armour
re enter and timag
make a firm stand
the slaves not satisfied they have beat us off prepare to sally forth
they are wild beasts and to be tamed by policy
each man take a tough whip in his hand such as you used to punish them with as masters in your looks carry severity and awe 'twill fright them more than your weapons
savage lions fly from the sight of fire and these that have forgot that duty you ne'er taught them with your swords when unexpected they behold those terrors advanced aloft that they were made to shake at 'twill force them to remember what they are and stoop to due obedience
enter from the city and other slaves
leave not a man alive a wound's but a flea biting to what we suffer'd being slaves
cimbrio what do we see
dare you rebel slaves
the senators shake their whips the slaves throw away their weapons and run off
where shall we hide us from their fury
o we shall be tormented
enter with them but yet forbear to kill them still remember they are part of your wealth and being disarm'd there is no danger
let us first deliver such as they have in fetters and at leisure determine of their punishment
friend to you i leave the disposition of what's mine i cannot think i am safe without your sister she is only worth my thought and till i see what she has suffer'd i am on the rack and furies my tormentors
a room in archidamus's house
i know i am pursued nor would i fly although the ports were open and a convoy ready to bring me off the baseness of these villains from the pride of all my hopes hath thrown me to the bottomless abyss of horror and despair had they stood firm i could have bought cleora's free consent with the safety of her father's life and brother's and forced leosthenes to quit his claim and kneel a suitor for me
you must not think what might have been but what must now be practised and suddenly resolve
all my poor fortunes are at the stake and i must run the hazard
unseen convey me to cleora's chamber for in her sight if it were possible i would be apprehended do not inquire the reason why but help me
make haste one knocks
exit jove turn all to the best
enter you are welcome sir
thou giv'st it in a heavy tone
sir we have so long fed on the bread of sorrow drinking the bitter water of afflictions made loathsome too by our continued fears comfort 's a stranger to us
your sufferings for which i am so overgone with grief i dare not ask without compassionate tears the villain's name that robb'd thee of thy honour for being train'd up in chastity's cold school and taught by such a mistress as cleora 'twere impious in me to think timandra fell with her own consent
how mean you fell sir
i understand you not
i would thou didst not or that i could not read upon thy face in blushing characters the story of libidinous rape confess it for you stand not accountable for a sin against whose strength your o'ermatch'd innocence could make no resistance under which odds i know cleora fell too heaven's help in vain invoked the amazed sun hiding his face behind a mask of clouds nor daring to look on it
in her sufferings all sorrow's comprehended what timandra or the city has endured her loss consider'd deserves not to be named
pray you do not bring sir in the chimeras of your jealous fears new monsters to affright us
o timandra that i had faith enough but to believe thee
i should receive it with a joy beyond assurance of elysian shades hereafter or all the blessings in this life a mother could wish her children crown'd with but i must not credit impossibilities yet i strive to find out that whose knowledge is a curse and ignorance a blessing
come discover what kind of look he had that forced thy lady thy ravisher i will inquire at leisure that when hereafter i behold a stranger but near him in aspect i may conclude though men and angels should proclaim him honest he is a hell bred villain
you are unworthy to know she is preserved preserved untainted sorrow but ill bestow'd hath only made a rape upon her comforts in your absence
come forth dear madam
nay she deserves the bending of your heart that to content you has kept a vow the breach of which a vestal though the infringing it had call'd upon her a living funeral must of force have shrunk at
no danger could compel her to dispense with her cruel penance though hot lust came arm'd to seize upon her when one look or accent might have redeem'd her
o do not show me a beam of comfort and straight take it from me
the means by which she was freed
speak o speak quickly each minute of delay 's an age of torment o speak timandra
free her from her oath herself can best deliver it
never did galley slave shake off his chains or look'd on his redemption from the oar with such true feeling of delight as now i find myself possessed of
now i behold true light indeed for since these fairest stars cover'd with clouds of your determinate will denied their influence to my optic sense the splendour of the sun appear'd to me but as some little glimpse of his bright beams convey'd into a dungeon to remember the dark inhabitants there how much they wanted
open these long shut lips and strike mine ears with music more harmonious than the spheres yield in their heavenly motions and if ever a true submission for a crime acknowledged may find a gracious hearing teach your tongue in the first sweet articulate sounds it utters to sign my wish'd for pardon
how greedily i receive this
stay best lady and let me by degrees ascend the height of human happiness
all at once deliver'd the torrent of my joys will overwhelm me so
now a little more and pray excuse me if like a wanton epicure i desire the pleasant taste these cates of comfort yield me should not too soon be swallow'd
have you not by your unspotted truth i do conjure you to answer truly suffer'd in your honour by force i mean for in your will i free you since i left syracusa
i restore this kiss so help me goodness
which i borrow'd when i last saw you
one pause more i beseech you i am like a man whose vital spirits consumed and wasted with a long and tedious fever unto whom too much of a strong cordial at once taken brings death and not restores him
yet i cannot fix here but must inquire the man to whom i stand indebted for a benefit which to requite at full though in this hand i grasp all sceptres the world's empire bows to would leave me a poor bankrupt
name him lady if of a mean estate i'll gladly part with my utmost fortunes to him but if noble in thankful duty study how to serve him or if of higher rank erect him altars and as a god adore him
if that goodness and noble temperance the queen of virtues bridling rebellious passions to whose sway such as have conquer'd nations have lived slaves did ever wing great minds to fly to heaven he that preserved mine honour may hope boldly to fill a seat among the gods and shake off our frail corruption
or if ever the powers above did mask in human shapes to teach mortality not by cold precepts forgot as soon as told but by examples to imitate their pureness and draw near to their celestial natures i believe he's more than man
you do describe a wonder
which will increase when you shall understand he was a lover
yes loved me leosthenes nay more so doted if e'er affections scorning gross desires may without wrong be styled so that he durst not with an immodest syllable or look in fear it might take from me whom he made the object of his better part discover i was the saint he sued to
i cannot speak it to the worth all praise i can bestow upon it will appear envious detraction
not to rack you further yet make the miracle full though of all men he hated you leosthenes as his rival so high yet he prized my content that knowing you were a man i favour'd he disdain'd not against himself to serve you
you conceal still the owner of these excellencies
'tis marullo my father's bondman
why do you laugh
to hear the labouring mountain of your praise deliver'd of a mouse
the man deserves not this scorn i can assure you
do you call what was his duty merit
yes and place it as high in my esteem as all the honours descended from your ancestors or the glory which you may call your own got in this action in which i must confess you have done nobly and i could add as i desired but that i fear 't would make you proud
why lady can you be won to give allowance that your slave should dare to love you
the immortal gods accept the meanest altars that are raised by pure devotions and sometimes prefer an ounce of frankincense honey or milk before whole hecatombs or sabæan gums offer'd in ostentation
are you sick of your old disease
zealous i grant in the defence of virtue
why good leosthenes though i endured a penance for your sake above example i have not so far sold myself i take it to be at your devotion but i may cherish desert in others where i find it
how would you tyrannize if you stood possess'd of that which is only yours in expectation that now prescribe such hard conditions to me
one kiss and i am silenced
i vouchsafe it yet i must tell you 'tis a favour that marullo when i was his not mine own durst not presume to ask no when the city bow'd humbly to licentious violence and when i was of men and gods forsaken deliver'd to his power he did not press me to grace him with one look or syllable or urged the dispensation of an oath made for your satisfaction the poor wretch having related only his own sufferings and kiss'd my hand which i could not deny him defending me from others never since solicited my favours
pray you end the story does not please me
well take heed of doubts and fears for know leosthenes a greater injury cannot be offer'd to innocent chastity than unjust suspicion
i love marullo's fair mind not his person let that secure you
and i here command you if i have any power in you to stand between him and all punishment and oppose his temperance to his folly if you fail no more i will not threaten
what a bridge of glass i walk upon over a river of certain ruin mine own weighty fears cracking what should support me
and those helps which confidence lends to others are from me ravish'd by doubts and wilful jealousy
another room in the same
but are you sure we are safe
you need not fear they are all under guard their fangs pared off the wounds their insolence gave you to be cured with the balm of your revenge
and shall i be the thing i was born my lord
the same wise thing
'slight what a beast they have made thee
afric never produced the like
i think so nor the land where apes and monkeys grow like crabs and walnuts on the same tree
not all the catalogue of conjurers or wise women bound together could have so soon transform'd me as my rascal did with his whip for not in outside only but in my own belief i thought myself as perfect a baboon timag
an ass thou wert ever
and would have given one leg with all my heart for good security to have been a man after three lives or one and twenty years though i had died on crutches
never varlets so triumph'd o'er an old fat man i was famish'd
indeed you are fallen away
three years of feeding on cullises and jelly though his cooks lard all he eats with marrow or his doctors pour in his mouth restoratives as he sleeps will not recover him
but your ladyship looks sad on the matter as if you had miss'd your ten crown amber possets good to smooth the cutis as you call it
pray you forbear i am an alter'd woman
so it seems a part of your honour's ruff stands out of rank too
no matter i have other thoughts
not ten days since it would have vex'd you more than the loss of your good name
enter and with a guard
looks our cleora lovely
in my thoughts sir
but why this guard
it is timoleon's pleasure the slaves have been examined and confess their riot took beginning from your house and the first mover of them to rebellion your slave marullo
i more than fear
they may search boldly
enter speaking to the guard within
you are unmanner'd grooms
to pry into my lady's private lodgings there's no marullos there
re enter and guard with timag
now i suspect too
where found you him
close hid in your sister's chamber
is that the villain's sanctuary
this confirms all she deliver'd false
but that i scorn to rust my good sword in thy slavish blood thou now wert dead
he's more a slave than fortune or misery can make me that insults upon unweapon'd innocence
curs snap at lions in the toil whose looks frighted them being free
as a wild beast drive him before you
darest thou presume to name her
yes and love her and may say have deserved her
stop his mouth load him with irons too
exit guard with cleon
i am deadly sick to look on him
if he get loose i know it i caper like an ape again i feel the whip already
this goes to my lady
come cheer you sir we'll urge his punishment to the full satisfaction of your anger
he is not worth my thoughts
no corner left in all the spacious rooms of my vex'd heart but is fill'd with cleora and the rape she has done upon her honour with my wrong the heavy burden of my sorrow's song
a room in archidamus's house
thou art thine own disposer
were his honours and glories centupled as i must confess leosthenes is most worthy yet i will not however i may counsel force affection
it needs not sir i prize him to his worth nay love him truly yet would not live slaved to his jealous humours since by the hopes of heaven as i am free from violence in a thought i am not guilty
'tis believed cleora and much the rather our great gods be praised for 't
in that i find beyond my hopes no sign of riot in my house but all things order'd as if i had been present
may that move you to pity poor marullo
'tis my purpose to do him all the good i can cleora but this offence being against the state must have a public trial
in the mean time be careful of yourself and stand engaged no further to leosthenes than you may come off with honour for being once his wife you are no more your own nor mine but must resolve to serve and suffer his commands and not dispute them ere it be too late consider it duly
i must to the senate
i am much distracted in leosthenes i can find nothing justly to accuse but his excess of love which i have studied to cure with more than common means yet still it grows upon him
and if i may call my sufferings merit i stand bound to think on marullo's dangers though i save his life his love is unrewarded i confess both have deserved me yet of force must be unjust to one such is my destiny
whence flow these tears
i have met madam an object of such cruelty as would force a savage to compassion
speak what is it
men pity beasts of rapine if o'ermatch'd though baited for their pleasure but these monsters upon a man that can make no resistance are senseless in their tyranny
let it be granted marullo is a slave he's still a man a capital offender yet in justice not to be tortured till the judge pronounce his punishment
dragg'd to prison with more than barbarous violence spurn'd and spit on by the insulting officers his hands pinion'd behind his back loaden with fetters yet with a saint like patience he still offers his face to their rude buffets
o my grieved soul
it seems my lord your brother's for he's a looker on and it takes from honour'd leosthenes to suffer it for his respect to you whose name in vain the grieved wretch loudly calls on
by diana 'tis base in both and to their teeth i'll tell them that i am wrong'd in 't
what will you do
in person visit and comfort him
that will bring fuel to the jealous fires which burn too hot already in lord leosthenes
let them consume him
i am mistress of myself
where cruelty reigns there dwells nor love nor honour
though hitherto i have run a desperate course to serve my brother's purposes now 'tis fit enter and i study mine own ends
they come assist me in these my undertakings love's great patron as my intents are honest
'tis my fault distrust of other springs timagoras from diffidence in ourselves but i will strive with the assurance of my worth and merits to kill this monster jealousy
'tis a guest in wisdom never to be entertain'd on trivial probabilities but when he does appear in pregnant proofs not fashion'd by idle doubts and fears to be received they make their own wrongs that are too secure as well as such as give them growth and being from mere imagination
though i prize cleora's honour equal with mine own and know what large additions of power this match brings to our family i prefer our friendship and your peace of mind so far above my own respects or hers that if she hold not her true value in the test 'tis far from my ambition for her cure that you should wound yourself
this argues for me
why she should be so passionate for a bondman falls not in compass of my understanding but for some nearer interest or he raise this mutiny if he loved her as you say she does confess he did but to possess the prize he ventured for to me's a riddle
i have answer'd that objection in my strong assurance of her virtue
'tis unfit then that i should press it further
now i must make in or all is lost
how wild she looks
how is it with thy lady
collect thyself and speak
as you are noble have pity or love piety
out with it boldly
o the best of ladies i fear is gone for ever
'sdeath be a man sir
take it then in as many sighs as words my lady timag
no sooner heard marullo was imprison'd but she fell into a deadly swoon
but she recover'd say so or he will sink too
brought again to life but with much labour she awhile stood silent yet in that interim vented sighs as if they labour'd from the prison of her flesh to give her grieved soul freedom
on the sudden transported on the wings of rage and sorrow she flew out of the house and unattended enter'd the common prison
this confirms what but before i fear'd
there you may find her and if you love her as a sister timag
or you respect her safety as a lover procure marullo's liberty
she'll run mad else or do some violent act upon herself my lord her father sensible of her sufferings labours to gain his freedom
has she bewitch'd him too
i'll hear no more
come sir we'll follow her and if no persuasion can make her take again her natural form which by some powerful spell she has cast off this sword shall disenchant her
o my heart strings
i knew 't would take
pardon me fair cleora though i appear a traitress which thou wilt do in pity of my woes when i make known my lawful claim and only seek mine own
that the word anciently had this meaning could be proved by many examples e
the more my fault to scape his hands where i was like to die
" pericles act sc
there's for your privacy
stay unbind his hands
i dare not madam
i will buy thy danger take more gold do not trouble me with thanks i do suppose it done
my better angel assumes this shape to comfort me and wisely since from the choice of all celestial figures he could not take a visible form so full of glorious sweetness
i am flesh and blood and do partake thy tortures
can it be that charity should persuade you to descend so far from your own height as to vouchsafe to look upon my sufferings
how i bless my fetters now and stand engaged to fortune for my captivity no my freedom rather
for who dare think that place a prison which you sanctify with your presence
or believe sorrow has power to use her sting on him that is in your compassion arm'd and made impregnable though tyranny raise at once all engines to assault him
indeed virtue with which you have made evident proofs that you are strongly fortified cannot fall though shaken with the shock of fierce temptations but still triumphs in spite of opposition
for myself i may endeavour to confirm your goodness a sure retreat which never will deceive you and with unfeigned tears express my sorrow for what i cannot help
do you weep for me
o save that precious balm for nobler uses
i am unworthy of the smallest drop which in your prodigality of pity you throw away on me
ten of these pearls were a large ransom to redeem a kingdom from a consuming plague or stop heaven's vengeance call'd down by crying sins though at that instant in dreadful flashes falling on the roofs of bold blasphemers
i am justly punish'd for my intent of violence to such pureness and all the torments flesh is sensible of a soft and gentle penance
which is ended in this your free confession
what an object have i encounter'd
i am blasted too yet hear a little further
could i expire now these white and innocent hands closing my eyes thus 'twere not to die but in a heavenly dream to be transported without the help of charon to the elysian shades
you make me bold and but to wish such happiness i fear may give offence
no for believe 't marullo you've won so much upon me that i know not that happiness in my gift but you may challenge
are you yet satisfied
nor can you wish but what my vows will second though it were your freedom first and then in me full power to make a second tender of myself and you receive the present
by this kiss from me a virgin bounty i will practise all arts for your deliverance and that purchased in what concerns your further aims i speak it do not despair but hope and come forward
to have the hangman when he is married to the cross in scorn to say gods give you joy
but look on me and be not too indulgent to your folly and then but that grief stops my speech imagine what language i should use
against thyself thy malice cannot reach me
no brother though you join in the dialogue to accuse me what i have done i'll justify and these favours which you presume will taint me in my honour though jealousy use all her eyes to spy out one stain in my behaviour or envy as many tongues to wound it shall appear my best perfections
for to the world i can in my defence allege such reasons as my accusers shall stand dumb to hear them when in his fetters this man's worth and virtues but truly told shall shame your boasted glories which fortune claims a share in
the base villain shall never live to hear it
through me you shall pass to him
on whom is your sword drawn
are you a judge
or else ambitious of the hangman's office before it be design'd you
you are bold too unhand my daughter
she's my valour's prize
with her consent not otherwise
you may urge your title in the court if it prove good possess her freely
guard him safely off too
you'll hear me sir
if you have aught to say deliver it in public all shall find a just judge of timoleon
you must of force now use your patience
exeunt all but and timag
whirlwinds of rage possess me you are wrong'd beyond a stoic sufferance yet you stand as you were rooted
i feel something here that boldly tells me all the love and service i pay cleora is another's due and therefore cannot prosper
melancholy which now you must not yield to
'tis apparent in fact your sister's innocent however changed by her violent will
if you believe so follow the chase still and in open court plead your own interest we shall find the judge our friend i fear not
something i shall say but what timag
collect yourself as we walk thither
the court of justice
nor can it fall within the reach of my belief a slave should be the owner of a temperance which this age can hardly parallel in freeborn lords or kings proud of their purple
'tis most true and though at first it did appear a fable all circumstances meet to give it credit which works so on me that i am compell'd to be a suitor not to be denied he may have equal hearing
sir you graced me with the title of your mistress but my fortune is so far distant from command that i lay by the power you gave me and plead humbly for the preserver of my fame and honour
and pray you sir in charity believe that since i had ability of speech my tongue has been so much inured to truth i know not how to lie
i'll rather doubt the oracles of the gods than question what your innocence delivers and as far as justice and mine honour can give way he shall have favour
bring him in unbound exeunt officers
and though leosthenes may challenge from me for his late worthy service credit to all things he can allege in his own cause marullo so i think you call his name shall find i do reserve one ear for him enter and to let in mercy
sit and take your places the right of this fair virgin first determined your bondmen shall be censured
temper'd i say with mercy
enter at one door and at the other officers with and timol
your hand leosthenes i cannot doubt you that have been victorious in the war should in a combat fought with words come off but with assured triumph
my deserts sir if without arrogance i may style them such arm me from doubt and fear
nor be thou daunted howsoe'er thy fortune has mark'd thee out a slave to speak thy merits for virtue though in rags may challenge more than vice set off with all the trim of greatness
i had rather fall under so just a judge than be acquitted by a man corrupt and partial in his censure
note his language it relishes of better breeding than his present state dares promise
place the fair lady in the midst that both looking with covetous eyes upon the prize they are to plead for may from the fair object teach hermes eloquence
am i fallen so low
my birth my honour and what 's dearest to me my love and witness of my love my service so undervalued that i must contend with one where my excess of glory must make his o'erthrow a conquest
shall my fulness supply defects in such a thing that never knew any thing but want and emptiness give him a name and keep it such from this unequal competition
if my pride or any bold assurance of my worth has pluck'd this mountain of disgrace upon me i am justly punish'd and submit but if i have been modest and esteem'd myself more injured in the tribute of the praise which no desert of mine prized by self love ever exacted may this cause and minute for ever be forgotten
i dwell long upon mine anger and now turn to you ungrateful fair one and since you are such 'tis lawful for me to proclaim myself and what i have deserved
neglect and scorn from me for this proud vaunt
you nourish lady your own dishonour in this harsh reply and almost prove what some hold of your sex you are all made up of passion for if reason or judgment could find entertainment with you or that you would distinguish of the objects you look on in a true glass not seduced by the false light of your too violent will i should not need to plead for that which you with joy should offer
is my high birth a blemish
or does my wealth which all the vain expense of women cannot waste breed loathing in you
the honours i can call mine own thought scandals
am i deform'd or for my father's sins mulcted by nature
if you interpret these as crimes 'tis fit i should yield up myself most miserably guilty
but perhaps which yet i would not credit you have seen this gallant pitch the bar or bear a burden would crack the shoulders of a weaker bondman
you are foul mouth'd
i speak in the way of supposition and entreat you with all the fervour of a constant lover that you would free yourself from these aspersions or any imputation black tongued slander could throw on your unspotted virgin whiteness to which there is no easier way than by vouchsafing him your favour him to whom next to the general and the gods and fautors the country owes her safety
leap into his arms and there ask pardon
you expect your slave's reply no doubt we shall have a fine oration i will teach my spaniel to howl in sweeter language and keep a better method
you forget the dignity of the place
'tis your authority gives me a tongue i should be dumb else and i am secure i cannot clothe my thoughts and just defence in such an abject phrase but 'twill appear equal if not above my low condition
i need no bombast language stolen from such as make nobility from prodigious terms the hearers understand not i bring with me no wealth to boast of neither can i number uncertain fortune's favours with my merits i dare not force affection or presume to censure her discretion that looks on me as a weak man and not her fancy's idol
how i have loved and how much i have suffer'd and with what pleasure undergone the burden of my ambitious hopes in aiming at the glad possession of a happiness the abstract of all goodness in mankind can at no part deserve with my confession of mine own wants is all that can plead for me
but if that pure desires not blended with foul thoughts that like a river keeps his course retaining still the clearness of the spring from whence it took beginning may be thought worthy acceptance then i dare rise up and tell this gay man to his teeth i never durst doubt her constancy that like a rock beats off temptations as that mocks the fury of the proud waves nor from my jealous fears question that goodness to which as an altar of all perfection he that truly loved should rather bring a sacrifice of service than raze it with the engines of suspicion of which when he can wash an æthiop white leosthenes may hope to free himself but till then never
i will go further and make good upon him the pride of all his honours birth and fortunes he's more unworthy than myself
confute him with a whip and the doubt decided punish him with a halter
my ribs though made of brass cannot contain my heart swollen big with rage
let fury then disperse these clouds in which i long have march'd disguised throws off his disguise
that when they know whom they have injured they may faint with horror of my revenge which wretched men
expect as sure as fate to suffer
'tis the bold theban
there's no hope for me then i thought i should have put in for a share and borne cleora from them both but now this stranger looks so terrible that i dare not so much as look on her
now as myself thy equal at thy best leosthenes
for you timagoras praise heaven you were born cleora's brother 'tis your safest armour
but i lose time
the base lie cast upon me i thus return thou art a perjured man false and perfidious and hast made a tender of love and service to this lady when thy soul if thou hast any can bear witness that thou wert not thine own for proof of this look better on this virgin and consider this persian shape laid by and she appearing in a greekish dress such as when first you saw her if she resemble not pisander's sister one call'd statilia
my guilt so chokes my spirits i cannot deny my falsehood nor excuse it
this is she to whom thou wert contracted this the lady that when thou wert my prisoner fairly taken in the spartan war then begg'd thy liberty and with it gave herself to thee ungrateful
no more sir i entreat you i perceive true sorrow in his looks and a consent to make me reparation in mine honour and then i am most happy
the wrong done her drew me from thebes with a full intent to kill thee but this fair object met me in my fury and quite disarm'd me
being denied to have her by you my lord archidamus and not able to live far from her love the mistress of all quaint devices prompted me to treat with a friend of mine who as a pirate sold me for a slave to you my lord and gave my sister as a present to cleora
there how i bare myself needs no relation but if so far descending from the height of my then flourishing fortunes to the lowest condition of a man to have means only to feed my eye with the sight of what i honour'd the dangers too i underwent the sufferings the clearness of my interest may deserve a noble recompense in your lawful favour now 'tis apparent that leosthenes can claim no interest in you you may please to think upon my service
sir my want of power to satisfy so great a debt makes me accuse my fortune but if that out of the bounty of your mind you think a free surrender of myself full payment i gladly tender it
with my consent too all injuries forgotten
i will study in my future service to deserve your favour and good opinion
thus i gladly fee this advocate to plead for me
you will find me an easy judge
when i have yielded reasons of your bondmen's falling off from their obedience then after as you please determine of me
i found their natures apt to mutiny from your too cruel usage and made trial how far they might be wrought on to instruct you to look with more prevention and care to what they may hereafter undertake upon the like occasions
the hurt 's little they have committed nor was ever cure but with some pain effected
i confess in hope to force a grant of fair cleora i urged them to defend the town against you nor had the terror of your whips but that i was preparing for defence elsewhere so soon got entrance in this i am guilty now as you please your censure
bring them in and though you've given me power i do entreat such as have undergone their insolence it may not be offensive though i study pity more than revenge
'twill best become you
for me i'll find a time to be revenged hereafter
and now the war being ended to our wishes and such as went the pilgrimage of love happy in full fruition of their hopes 'tis lawful thanks paid to the powers divine to drown our cares in honest mirth and wine
