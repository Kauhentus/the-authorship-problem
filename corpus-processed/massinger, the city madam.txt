city madam a actus primus scena prima
enter goldwire and tradewell
goldwire the ship is safe in the pool then
and makes good in her rich fraught the name shee bears the speedwell my master will find it for on my certain knowledg for every hundred that hee ventu∣red in her she hath return'd him five
and it comes timely for besides a paiment on the nail for a mannor late purchas'd by my master his young daughters are ripe for marriage
mistris anne and mary and with some addition or 'tis more punishable in our house then scandalum magnatum
tradewell 'tis great pitie such a gentleman as my master for that title his being a citizen cannot take from him hath no male heir to inherit his estate and keep his name alive
the want of one swells my young mistresses and their madam mother with hopes above their birth and scale
their dreams are of being made countesses and they take state as they were such already
when you went to the indies there was some shape and proportion of a merchants house in our family but since my master to gain precedencie for my mistris above some elder merchants wives was knighted 'tis grown a little court in bravery variety of fashions and those rich ones there are few great ladies going to a masque that do out shine ours in their every day habits
'tis strange my master in his wisdom can give the reins to such exorbitancie
he must or there's no peace nor rest for him at home i grant his state will bear it yet hee's censur'd for his indulgence and for sir john frugall by some styl'd sir john prodigal
is his brother mr
yes the more his misery poor man
still in the counter
in a worser place
he was redeemed from the hole to live in our house in hell since his base usage consider'd 'tis no better
my proud ladie admits him to her table marry ever beneath the salt and there he sits the subject of her contempt and scorn and dinner ended his courteous neeces find emploiment for him fitting an under prentice or a footman and not an uncle
i wonder being a scholler well read and travel'd the world yielding means for men of such desert he should endure it
enter star gaze ladie anne mary millescent in several postures with looking glasses at their girdles
he does with a strange patience and to us the servants so familiar nay humble
i'le tell you but i am cut off
look these like a citizens wife and daughters
in their habits they appear other things but what are the motives of this strange preparation
the young wag tails expect their suitors
the first the son and heir of the lord ladie who needs my masters money as his daughter does his honour
plenty a rough hew'n gentleman and newly come to a great estate and so all aids of art in them's excusable
you have done your parts here to your studie and be curious in the search of the nativities
me thinks the mother as if she could renew her youth in care nay curiosity to appear lovely comes not behind her daughters
keeps the first place and though the church book speak her fifty they that say she can write thirty more offend her then if they tax'd her honesty t'other day a tenant of hers instructed in her humor but one she never saw being brought before her for saying onely good young mistris help me to the speech of your lady mother so far pleas'd her that he got his lease renew'd for't
how she bristles prethee observe her
as i hope to see a country knights son and heir walk bare before you when you are a countess as you may be one when my master dies or leavs trading and i continuing your principal woman take the upper hand of a squires wife though a justice as i must by the place you give me you look now as young as when you were married
i think i bear my years well
why should you talk of years
time hath not plough'd one furrow in your face and were you not known the mother of my young ladies you might passe for a virgin of fifteen
here's no grosse flattery will she swallow this
you see she does and glibly
you never can be old wear but a masque forty years hence and you will still seem young in your other parts what a waste is here
that i had been born a king
and here a hand to be kifs'd ever pardon my boldnesse madam then for a leg and foot you will be courter when a great grandmother
these indeed wench are not so subject to decayings as the face their comliness last's longer
ever ever such a rare featur'd and proportion'd madam london could never boast of
where are my shoos
those that your ladyship gave order should be made of the spanish perfum'd skins
i sent the prison bird this morning for em but he neglects his duty
he is grown exceeding carelesse
and begins to murmur at our commands and sometimes grumbles to us he is forsooth our uncle
he is your slave and as such use him
willingly but hee's grown rebellious madam
enter luke with shooes garters and roses
nay like hen like chicken
pere he comes sweating all over he shews like a walking fripperie
very good sir were you drunk last night that you could rise no sooner with humble diligence to do what my daughters and woman did command you
drunk an't please you
drunk i said sirrah
dar'st thou in a look repine or grumble
thou unthankful wretch did our charitie redeem thee out of prison thy patrimonie spent ragged and lowsie
when the sheriffs basket and his broken meat were your festivall exceedings and is this so soon forgotten
i confesse i am your creature madam
and good reason why you should continue so
who did new cloath you
admitted you to the dining room
allowed you a fresh bed in the garret
or from whom receiv'd you spending money
i owe all this to your goodnesse madam for it you have my prayers the beggars satisfaction all my studies forgetting what i was but withall duty remembring what i am are how to please you
and if in my long stay i have offended i ask your pardon
though you may consider being forc'd to fetch these from the old exchange these from the tower and these from westminster i could not come much sooner
here was a walke to breath a foot man
'tis a curious fan
these roses will shew rare would t'were in fashion that the garters might be seen too
many ladyes that know they have good legs wish the same with you men that way have th'advantage
i was with the lady and delivered her the sattin for her gown and velvet for her petticote this night she vows shee'l pay you
how i am bound to your favour luke
as i live you will perfume all rooms you walk in
get your furr you shall pull'em on within
that servile office her pride imposes on him
enter holdfast with porters
what have you brought there
the cream of the market provision enough to serve a garrison
i weep to think on't
when my master got his wealth his family fed on roots and livers and necks of beef on sundays
but now i fear it will be spent in poultry
butchers meat will not go down
why you rascall is it at your expence
what cooks have you provided
the best of the city
they have wrought at my lord mayors
fye on em they smel of fleet lane and pie corner
and thinks the happinesse of mans life consists in a mighty shoulder of mutton
i'le have none shall touch what i shall eat you grumbling curr but french men and italians they wear sattin and dish no meat but in silver
you may want though a dish or two when the service ends
leave prating i'le have my will do you as i command you

enter lacie and page
you were with plenty
and what answer return'd the clown
he is transform'd and grown a gallant of the last edition more rich then gaudie in his habit yet the freedom and the bluntnesse of his language continues with him
when i told him that you gave him caution as he lov'd the peace and safety of his life he should forbear to passe the merchants threshold untill you of his two daughters had made choice of her whom you design'd to honour as your wife
he smil'd in scorn
his words confirm'd it they were few but to this purpose tell your master though his lordship in reversion were now his it cannot awe me
i was born a free man and will not yeeld in the way of affection precedence to him
i will vifit em though he sate porter to deny my entrance
when i meet him next i'le say more to his face
deliver thou this then gave me a piece to help my memorie and so we parted
where got he this spirit
at the academie of valour newly erected for the institution of elder brothers
where they are taught the ways though they refuse to seal for a duellist how to decline a challenge
he himself can best resolve you
enter plenty and three serving men
what with me sir
how big you look
i will not loose a hat to a hairs breadth move your bever i'le move mine or if you desire to prove your sword mine hangs as near my right hand and will as soon out though i keep not a fencer to breath me walke into moor fields i dare look on your toledo
do not shew a foolish valour in the streets to make work for shop keepers and their clubs 'tis scurvie and the women will laugh at us
you presume on the protection of your hinds
i scorn it though i keep men i fight not with their fingers nor make it my religion to follow the gallants fashion to have my family consisting in a foot man and a page and those two sometimes hungrie
i can feed these and cloath'em too my gay sir
what a fine man hath your taylor made you
tis quite contrary i have made my taylor for my cloaths are pai'd for assoon as put on a sin your man of title is seldom guiltie of but heaven forgive it
i have other faults too very incident to a plain gentleman
i eat my venison with my neighbours in the countrie and present not my phesants partridges and growse to the userer nor ever yet paid brokage to his scrivener
i flatter not my mercers wife nor feast her with the first cherries or pelcods to prepare me credit with her husband when i com to london
the wooll of my sheep or a score or two of fat oxen in smithfield give me money for my expences
i can make my wife a jointure of such lands too as are not encombred no annuity or statue lying on'em
this i can do and it please your future honour and why therefore you should forbid my being a suiter with you my dulnesse apprehends not
i have heard you sir and in my patience shewn to much of the stoicks
but to parley further or answer your grosse jeers would write me coward
this onely thy great grandfather was a butcher and his son a grasier thy sire constable of the hundred and thou the first of your dunghill created gemtleman now you may come on sir you and your thrashers
stir not on your lives

very well sir you look for this defence
'tis thy protection but it will deceive thee

and in plain terms tell you enter lady anne mary and milliscent
neither your birth sir maurice nor your wealth shall priviledg this riot

can you imagine it can stand with the credit of my daughters to be the argument of your swords
nay e're you do salute or i give way to any private conference shake hands in sign of peace

this is as it should be

luke the world's much chang'd with you within these few months then you were the gallant no meeting at the horse race cocking hunting shooting or bowling at which mr
luke was not a principal gamester and companion for the nobility
i have paid dear for those follies my good lord and 'tis but justice that such as soar above their pich and will not be warn'd by my example should like me share in the miseries that wait upon't
your honor in your charitie may do well not to upbraid me with those weaknesses too late repented
i nor do nor will and you shall find i'le lend a helping hand to raise your fortunes how deals your brother with you
beyond my merit i thank his goodnesse for't
i am a freeman all my debts discharg'd nor does one creditor undone by me curse my loose riots
i have meat and cloaths time to ask heaven remission for what's past cares of the world by me are laid aside my present poverty's a blessing to me and though i have been long i dare not say i ever liv'd till now
you bear it well yet as you wish i should receive for truth what you deliver with that truth acquaint me with your brothers inclination
i have heard in the acquisition of his wealth he weighs no whose ruines he builds upon
in that report wrongs him my lord
he is a citizen and would increase his heap and will not lose what the law gives him
such as are worldly wise pursue that tract or they will ne're wear skarlet
but if your honor please to know his temper you are come opportunely
i can bring you where you unseen shall see and hear his carriage towards some poor men whose making or undoing depend upon his pleasure

for as i am a gentleman enter luke placing the lord lacie luke
there you may hear all
i pawn'd you my land for the tenth part of the value now cause i am a gamester and keep ordinaries and a liverie punk or so and trade not with the money mongers wives not one will be bound for me 'tis a hard case you must give me longer day or i shall grow very angry
fret and spare not
i know no obligation lies upon me with my honey to feed drones
but to the purpose how much owes penurie
two hundred pounds his bond three times since forfeited
yes sir and execution out against him sir john
for bodie and goods
i am undone my wife and family
must starve for want of bread
more infidel thou in not providing better to support'em
an estate for a good man
you were the glorious trader embrac'd all bargains the main venturer in every ship that launch'd forth kept your wife as a ladie she had her coach her choice of summer houses built with other mens moneys took up at interest the certain road to ludgate in a citizen
pray you acquaint me how were my thousand pounds imploy'd
insult not on my calamity though being a debtor and a slave to him that lends i must endure it
yet hear me speak thus much in my defence losses at sea and those sir great and many by storms and tempests not domestical riots in soothing my wives humor or mine own have brought me to this low ebb
suppose this true what is't to me
i must and will have my money or i'le protest you first and that done have the statute made for bankrupts serv'd upon you
'tis in your power but not in mine to shun it
not as a brother sir but with such dutie as i should use unto my father since your charitie is my parent give me leave to speak my thoughts
what would you say
luke no word sir i hope shall give offence nor let it relish of flattery though i proclaim aloud i glory in the bravery of your mind to which your wealths a servant
not that riches is or should be contemn'd it being a blessing deriv'd from heaven and by your industry pull'd down upon you but in this dear sir you have many equals such a mans possessions extend as far as yours a second hath his bags as full a third in credit flies as high in the popular voice but the distinction and noble difference by which you are divided from 'em is that you are styl'd gentle in your abundance good in plentie and that you feel compassion in your bowels of others miseries i have found it sir heaven keep me thankful for't while they are curs'd as rigid and inexorable
i delight not to hear this spoke to my face
that shall not grieve you your affability and mildnesse cloath'd in the garments of your debtors breath shall every where though you strive to conceal it be seen and wondred at and in the act with a prodigall hand rewarded
whereas such as are born only for themselvs and live so though prosperous in wordly understandings are but like beasts of rapine that by odds of strength usurp and tyrannize o're others brought under their subjection
i am strangely taken with him
can you think sir in your unquestion'd wisdome i beseech you the goods of this poor man sold at an out crie his wife turn'd out of doors his children forc'd to beg their bread this gentleman's estate by wrong extorted can advantage you
if it thrive with him hang me as it will damn him if he be not converted
you are too violent
or that the ruine of this once brave merchant for such he was esteem'd though now decay'd will raise your reputation with good men
but you may urge pray you pardon me my zeal makes mee thus bold and vehement in this you satisfie your anger and revenge for being defeated
suppose this it will not repair your losse and there was never yet but shame and scandall in a victorie when the rebells unto reasons passions fought it
then for revenge by great souls it was ever contemn'd though offered entertain'd by none but cowards base and abject spirits strangers to morall honestie and never yet acquainted with religion
our divines cannot speak more effectually
shall i be talk'd out of my money
no sir but intreated to do your self a benefit and preserve what you possesse intire
how my good brother
by making these your beads men
when they eat their thanks next heaven will be paid to your mercy when your ships are at sea their prayers will swell the sails with prosperous winds and guard'em from tempests and pirates keep your ware houses from fire or quench'em with their tears
write you a good man in the peoples hearts follow you every where
if this could be
it must or our devotions are but words i see a gentle promise in your eie make it a blessed act and poor me rich in being the instrument
but do you hear no talk of't

your charity to your debtors i do commend but where you should expresse your pietie to the height i must boldly tell you you shew your self an athiest
make me know my error and for what i am thus censur'd and i will purge my self or else confesse a guiltie cause
it is your harsh demeanour to your poor brother
'tis more then can admit defence
you keep him as a parasite to your table subject to the scorn of your proud wife an underling to his own neeces
and can i with mine honor mix my blood with his that is not sensible of his brothers miseries
pray you take me with you and let mee yeeld my reasons why i am no opener handed to him
i was born his elder brother yet my fathers fondnesse to him the younger robb'd me of my birth right he had a fair estate which his loose riots soon brought to nothing
wants grew heavy on him and when layd up for debt of all forsaken and in his own hopes lost i did redeem him lord
you could not do lesse
was i bound to it my lord
what i possesse i may with justice call the harvest of my industry
would you have me neglecting mine own family to give up my estate to his disposure
i would have you what's pass'd forgot to use him as a brother a brother of fair parts of a clear soul religious good and honest
outward gloss often deceivs may it not prove so in him and yet my long acquaintance with his nature renders me doubtful but that shall not make a breach between us let us in to dinner and what trust or imployment you think sit shall be conferred upon him if he prove true gold in the touch i'le be no mourner for it

why in this rage man
men may talk of country christmases and court∣gluttonie their thirty pound butter'd eggs their pies of carps tongues their pheasants drench'd with ambergreece the carkases of three fat weathers bruised for gravie to make sauce for a single peacock yet their feasts were fasts compar'd with the cities
what deer dainty was it thou murmur'st at
did you not observe it
there were three sucking piggs serv'd up in a dish took from the sow as soon as farrowed a fortnight fed with dates and muskadine that stood my master in twenty marks a piece besides the puddings in their bellies made of i know not what
i dare swear the cook that dress'd it was the devill disguis'd like a dutch man
yet all this will not make you fat fellow
i am rather starv'd to look on't
but here's the mischief though the dishes were rais'd one upon another as woodmongers do billets for the first the second and third course and most of the shopps of the best confectioners in london ransack'd to furnish out a banquet yet my lady call'd me penurious rascall and cri'd out there was nothing worth the eating
you must have patience this is not done often
'tis not fit it should threesuch dinners more would break an alderman and make him give up his cloak
i am resolv'd to have no hand in't
i'le make up my accompts and since my master longs to be undone the great fiend be his steward i will pray and blesse my self from him
the wretch shews in this an honest care
out on him with the fortune of a slave he has the mind of one
however she bears me hard i like my ladies humor and my brothers sufferage to it
they are now busie on all hands one side eager for large portions the other arguing strictly for jointures and securitie but this being above our scale no way concerns us
how dul you look
in the mean time how intend you to spend the hours
we well know how we would but dare not serve our wills
being prentices we are bound to attendance
have you almost serv'd out the term of your indentures yet make conscience by starts to use your liberty
hast thou traded in the other world expos'd unto all dangers to make thy master rich yet dar'st not take some portion of the profit for thy pleasure
or wilt thou being keeper of the cash like an ass that carries dainties feed on thistles
are you gentlemen born yet have no gallant tincture of gentry in you
you are no mechanicks nor serve some needy shop keeper who surveighs his every day takings
you have in your keeping a masse of wealth from which you may take boldly and no way be discover'd he's no rich man that knows all he possesses and leavs nothing for his servants to make prey of
i blush for you blush at your poverty of spirit you the brave sparks of the city
luke i wonder you should urge this having felt what miserie follows riot
and the penance you indur'd for't in the counter
you are fools the case is not the same
i spent mine own money and my stock being smal no mervail 'twas soon wasted
but you without the least doubt or suspicion if cautelous may make bold with your masters
as for example when his ships come home and you take your receipts as 'tis the fashion for fifty bales of silk you may write forty or for so many pieces of cloth of bodkin tissue gold silver velvets sattins taffaties a piece of each deducted from the grosse will never be miss'd a dash of a pen will do it
i but our fathers bonds that lye in pawn for our honesties must pay for't

and can you in your wisedom or rusticall simplicity imagine you have met some innocent country girle that never look'd further then her fathers farm nor knew more then the price of corn in the market or at what rate beef went a stone
that would surveigh your dayrie and bring in mutton out of cheese and butter
that could give directions at what time of the moon to cut her cocks sor apons against christmas or when to raise up goslings
these are arts would not mis become you though you should put in obedience and duty
yes and patience to sit like a fool at home and eye your thrashers then make provition for your slavering round when you come drunk from an ale house after hunting with your clowns and comrades as if all were yours you the lord paramount and i the drudge the case sir must be otherwise

i'le have the state convey'd into my hands and be put to his pension which the wise virago's of our climate practise i will receive your rents
you shall be hang'd first

a plentifull pox upon you mary
and when i have children if it be enquir'd by a stranger whose they are they shall still eccho my lady plenties
the husband never thought on
in their begetting i think so
since you'l marry in the city for our wealth in justice we must have the countries soveraignty
a nagg of forty shillings a couple of spaniels with a spar hawk is sufficient and these too as you shall behave your self during my pleasure i will not greatly stand on
i have said sir now if you like me so

it better would become you your means of life depending wholly on him to give your attendance
in my will i do but since he rode sorth yesterday with lord lacie i have not seen him
and wh went not you by his stirrup
how do you look
were his eies clos'd you'd be glad of such imploiment
'twas his pleasure i should wait your command those i am ever most ready to receive
i know you can speak well but say and do
enter lord lacie with a will
here comes my lord
further off you are no companion for him and his businesse aims not at you as i take it

i hp'd my lord you had brought mr
frugall with you for i must ask an account of him from you
i can give it ladie but with the best discretion of a woman and a strong fortifi'd patience i desire you to give it hearing luke
my lord you much amaze me
i shall astonish you
the noble merchant who living was for his integritie and upright dealing a rare miracle
in a rich citizen londons best honour is i am loth to speak it
i do suppose the worst not dead i hope
your supposition's true your hopes are false hee's dead
now they insult not
pray hear me out
dead to the world and you
and now lives onely to himself
act not the torturer in my afflictions but make me understand the summe of all that i must undergo
in few words take it he is retir'd into a monastery where he resolves to end his daies
i saw him take poste for dover and the wind sitting so fair by this hee's safe at calice and ere long will be at lovain
could i guesse what were the motives that induc'd him to it 'twere some allay to my sorrows
i 'le instruct you and chide you into that knowledg 'twas your pride above your rank and stubborn disobedience of these your daughters in their milk suck'd from you at home the harshnesse of his entertainment you wilfully forgetting that your all was borrowed from him and to hear abroad the imputations dispers'd upon you and justly too i fear that drew him to this strict retirement and thus much said for him i am my self to accuse you
i confesse a guilty cause to him but in a thought my lord i ne'rc wrong'd you
in fact you have the insolent disgrace you put upon my onely son and mr
plenty men that lov'd your daughters in a noble way to wash off the scandal put a resolution in 'em for three years travel
i am much griev'd for it
one thing i had forgot your rigor to his decaied brother in which your flatteries or sorcevies made him a coagent with you wrought not the least impression
'tis now past help after these storms my lord a little calme if you please
if what i have told you shew'd like a storm what now i must deliver will prove a raging tempest
his whole estate in lands and leases debts and present moneys with all the movables he stood posses'd of with the best advice which he could get for gold from his learned counsel by this formall will is pass'd o're to his brother

this humilitie from him may gain remission and perhaps forgetfulnesse of your barbarous usage to him
am i come to this
enjoy your own good sir but use it with due reverence
i once heard you speak most divinely in the opposition of a revengefull humor to these shew it and such who then depended on the mercy of your brother wholly now at your devotion and make good the opinion i held of you of which i am most confident
pray you rise and rise with this assurance i am still as i was of late your creature and if rais'd in any thing 'tis in my power to serve you my will is still the same
this heap of wealth which you possesse me of
which to a worldly man had been a blessing and to the messenger might with justice challenge a kind of adoration is to me a curse i cannot thank you for and much lesse rejoyce in that tranquility of mind my brothers vows must purchase
i have made a dear exchange with him
he now enjoyes my peace and poverty the trouble of his wealth confer'd on me and that a burthen too heavy for my weak shouldiers
honest soul with what feeling he receivs it
you shall have my best assistance if you please to use it to help you to suport it
by no means the waight shall rather sinck me then you part with one short minute from those lawfull pleasures which you were born to in your care to aid me you shall have all abundance
in my nature i was ever liberall my lord you know it
and now me thinks i see before my face the jubile of joy when it is assur'd my brother lives in me his debtors in full cups crown'd to my health with paeans to my praise will celabrate
for they well know 'tis far from me to take the forfeiture of a bond
nay i shall blush the interest never paid after three years when i demand my principall
and his servants who from a slavish fear pai'd her obedience by him exacted now when they are mine will grow familiar friends and as such use me being certain of the mildnesse of my temper which my change of fortune frequent in most men hath not the power to alter
yet take heed sir you ruine it not with too much lenity what his fit severity rais'd
and we fall from that height we have maintain'd
fle build it higher to admiration higher
with disdain i look upon these habits no way suiting the wife and daughters of a knighted citizen bless'd with abundance
there sir i joyn with you a fit decorum must be kept the court distinguished from the city
with your favour i know what you would say but give me leave in this to be your advocate
you are wide wide the whole region in what i purpose
since all the titles honours long descents borrow their gloss from wealth the rich with reason may challenge their perogatives
and it shall be my glory nay a triumph to revive in the pomp that these shall shine the memory of the roman matrons who kep't captive queens to be their hand maids

you talk'd of hebe of iris and i know not what but were they dres'd as we are they were sure some chandlers daughters bleaching linnen in moor fields
or exchange wenches comming from eating pudding pies on a sunday at pemlico or islington
i now dare style you so you were before too glorious to be look'd on now you appear like a city matron and my pretty neeces such things as were born and bred there
why should you ape the fashions of court ladies
whose high titles and pedegrees of long descen give warrant for their superfluous braverie
'twas monstrous till now you ne're look'd lovely

your father was an honest country farmer

we put that trick upon your brother to have means to come to the citie
now to you wee'l discover the close design that brought us with assurance if you lend your aids to furnish us with that which in the colonie was not to be purchas'd no merchant ever made such a return for his most pretious venture as you shall receive from us far far above your hopes or fancie to imagine
musicians come down to make ready for the song at aras
it must be some strange commoditie and of a dear value such an opinion is planted in me you will deal fairly that i would not hazard
give me the name of't
i fear you will make some scruple in your conscience to grant it
no no so it may be done with safety and without danger of the law
for that you shall sleep securely
nor shall it diminish but add unto your heap such an increase as what you now possess shall appear an atome to the mountain it brings with it
do not rack me with expectation
thus then in a word the divel
why start you at his name
if you desire to wallow in wealth and worldly honors you must make haste to be familiar with him
this divel whose priest i am and by him made a deep magician for i can do wonders appear'd to me in virginia and commanded with many stripes for that's his cruel custome i should provide on pain of his fierce wrath against the next great sacrifice at which we groveling on our faces fall before him two christian virgins that with their pure blood might dy his horrid altars and a third in his hate to such embraces as are lawful married and with your cerimonious rites as an oblation unto hecate and wanton lust her favorite
a divellish custom and yet why should it startle me
there are enough of the sex fit fort his use but virgins and such a matron as you speak of hardly to be wrought to it
a mine of gold for a fee waits him that undertakes it and performs it
know you no distressed widow or poor maids whose want of dower though well born makes'em weary of their own country
such as had rather be miserable in another world then where they have surfeited in felicity
give me leave i would not loose this purchase
and two pure virgins
i think my sister though proud was ever honest and my neeces untainted yet
why should not they be shipp'd for this employment
they are burden some to me and eat too much
and if they stay in london they will find friends that to my losse will force me to composition
'twere a master piece if this could be effected
they were ever ambitious of title
should i urge matching with these they shall live indian queens it may do much
but what shall i feel here knowing to what they are design'd
they absent the thought of them will leave me
it shall be so
i'le furnish you and to indear the service in mine own family and my blood too
make this good and your house shall not contain the gold wee'l send you
you have seen my sister and my two neeces
these perswaded how happily they shall live and in what pomp when they are in your kingdoms for you must work'em a beliefe that you are kings
i'le put it in practice instantly
study you for moving language
how enter lady ann mary
dry your eyes and clear these clouds that do obscure your beauties
did you believe my personated reprehension though it shew'd like a rough anger could be serious
forget the fright i put you in
my ends in humbling you was to set off the height of honour principle honor which my studies when you least expect it shall confer upon you
still you seem doubtfull be not wanting to your selvs nor let the strangenesse of the means with the shadow of some danger render you incredulous
our usage hath been such as we can faintly hope that your intents and language are the same
i'le change those hopes to certainties
with what art he winds about them
what wil you say
or what thanks shall i look for
if now i raise you to such eminence as the wife and daughters of a citizen never arriv'd at
many for their wealth i grant have written ladies of honor and some few have higher titles and that's the farthest rise you can in england hope for
what think you if i should mark you out a way to live queens in another climate
one chair and wine
wee desire a competence
and prefer our countries smoke before outlandish fire
but should we listen to such impossibilities 'tis not in the power of man to make it good
nor is this seat of majesty far remov'd
it is but to virginia
remember sir i beseech you what creatures are shipp'd thither
condemn'd wretches forfeited to the law
strumpets and bauds for the abomination of their life spew'd out of their own country
your false fears abuse my noble purposes
such indeed are sent as slaves to labour there but you to absolute soveraignty
observe these men with reverence observe them
they are kings kings of such spacious territories and dominions as our great brtitain measur'd will appear a garden too't
you shall be ador'd there as goddesses
your litters made of gold supported by your vassalls proud to bear the burthen on their shoulders
pomp and ease with delicates that europe never knew like pages shall wait on you
if you have minds to entertain the greatnesse offer'd to you with outstretched arms and willing hands embrace it
but this refus'd imagine what can make you most miserable here and rest assur'd in storms it falls upon you take em in and use your best perswasion
i'le send em aboard in a dry fat
be not mov'd sir
wee'l work'em to your will yet e're we part your worldly cares defer'd a little mirth would not misbecome us

i must have none
not the city senate

the first would argue me of foolish oftentation the latter of too much hospitality and a virtue grown obsolete and uselesse
i will sit alone and surfet in my store while others with envy pine at it
my genius pamper'd with the thought of what i am and what they suffer i have mark'd out to miserie
you shall and something i will add you yet conceive not nor will i be flow pac'd

you have receiv'd penitent letters from your sons i doubt not
they are our onely sons

you are very peremptory pray you stay

i am honesten now by a hundred thousand pound i thank my stars for't upon the exchange and if your late opinion be alter'd who can help it
good my lord to the point
i have other businesse then to talk of honesty and opinions

here are two gentlemen the fathers of your brothers prentices
mine my lord i take it
they are welcome if they come prepar'd to satisfie the damage i have sustain'd by their sons
we are so you please to use a conscience
which we hope you will do for your own worships sake
conscience my friends and wealth are not always neighbours
should i part with what the law gives me i should suffer mainly in my reputation
for it would convince me of indiscretion
nor will you i hope move me to do my self such prejudice
they cannot look for't and preserve in me a thriving citizens credit
your bonds lie for your sons truth and they shall answer all they have run out
the masters never prosper'd since gentlemens sons grew prentices
when we look to have our business done at home they are abroad in the tenis court or in partridge alley in lambeth marsh or a cheating ordinary where i found your sons
i have your bonds look too't
a thousand pounds a piece and that will hardly repair my losses
lord thou dar'st not shew thy self such a divel
such a cut throat
i have heard of the usage of your brothers wife and daughters
you shall find you are not lawlesse and that your moneys cannot justifie your villanies
and good my lord now you talk in time of moneys pay in what you owe me
and give me leav to wonder your wisedome should have leisure to consider the businesse of these gentlemen or my carriage to my sister or my neeces being your self so much in my danger
i find in my counting house a mannor pawn'd pawn'd my good lord lacie mannour and that mannour from which you have the title of a lord and it please your good lordship
you are a noble man pray you pay in my moneys
the interest plenty ready to speak within will eat saster in't then aqua fortis in iron
now though you bear me hard i love your lordship
i grant your person to be priviledg'd from all arrests
yet there lives a foolish creature call'd an under sheriffe who being well paid will serve au extent on i ords or lowns land
pay it in i would be loth your name should sink

you are angry for my good counsell
look you to your bonds had i known of your comming believe it i would have had serjeants ready lord how you fret

you are constant to your purposes yet i think that i could stagger you
should i present your servants debters and the rest that suffer by your fit severity i presume the sight would move you to compassion
the musick that your orpheus made was harsh to the delight i should receive in hearing their cries and groans if it be in your power i would now see'em
