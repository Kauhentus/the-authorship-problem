enter mathias in armour sophia in a riding suit corisca hilario with other servants
since we must part sophia to pass further is not alone impertinent but dangerous
we are not distant from the turkish camp above five leagues and who knows but some party of his timariots that scour the country may fall upon us
− be now as thy name truly interpreted hath ever spoke thee wise and discreet and to thy understanding marry thy constant patience
you put me sir to the utmost trial of it
nay no melting since the necessity that now separates us we have long since disputed and the reasons forcing me to it too oft washed in tears
i grant that you in birth were far above me and great men my superiors rivals for you but mutual consent of heart as hands joined by true love hath made us one and equal nor is it in me mere desire of fame or to be cried up by the public voice for a brave soldier that puts on my armour such airy tumours take not me
you know how narrow our demeans are and what's more having as yet no charge of children on us we hardly can subsist
in you alone sir i have all abundance
for my mind's content in your own language i could answer you
you have been an obedient wife a right one and to my power though short of your desert i have been ever an indulgent husband
we have long enjoyed the sweets of love and though not to satiety or loathing yet we must not live such dotards on our pleasures as still to hug them to the certain loss of profit and preferment
competent means maintains a quiet bed want breeds dissention even in good women
have you found in me sir any distaste or sign of discontent for want of what's superfluous
no sophia nor shalt thou ever have cause to repent thy constant course in goodness if heaven bless my honest undertakings
'tis for thee that i turn soldier and put forth dearest upon this sea of action as a factor to trade for rich materials to adorn thy noble parts and shew them in full lustre
i blush that other ladies less in beauty and outward form but in the harmony of the soul's ravishing music the same age not to be named with thee should so out shine thee in jewèls and variety of wardrobes while you to whose sweet innocence both indies compared are of no value wanting these pass unregarded
if i am so rich or in your opiniön why should you borrow additions for me
i should be censured of ignorance possessing such a jewel above all price if i forbear to give it the best of ornaments therefore sophia in few words know my pleasure and obey me as you have ever done
to your discretion i leave the government of my family and our poor fortunes and from these command obedience to you as to myself to the utmost of what's mine live plentifully and ere the remnant of our store be spent with my good sword i hope i shall reap for you a harvest in such full abundance as shall make a merry winter
since you are not to be diverted sir from what you purpose all arguments to stay you here are useless go when you please sir
− eyes i charge you waste not one drop of sorrow look you hoard all up till in my widowed bed i call upon you but then be sure you fail not
you blest angels guardians of human life i at this instant forbear t'invoke you at our parting 'twere to personate devotiön
− my soul shall go along with you and when you are circled with death and horror seek and find you and then i will not leave a saint unsued to for your protectiön
to tell you what i will do in your absence would shew poorly my actions shall speak for me 'twere to doubt you to beg i may hear from you where you are you cannot live obscure nor shall one post by night or day pass unexamined by me
if i dwell long upon your lips consider kisses him
after this feast the griping fast that follows and it will be excusable pray turn from me
all that i can is spoken
forbear your wishes for me let me find them at my return in your prompt will to serve her
for my part sir i will grow lean with study to make her merry
though you are my lord yet being her gentlewoman by my place i may take my leave your hand or if you please to have me fight so high i'll not be coy but stand a tip toe for't
a kiss well begged corisca
'twas my fee love how he melts
i cannot blame my lady's unwillingness to part with such marmalade lips
there will be scrambling for them in the camp and were it not for my honesty i could wish now i were his leaguer laundress i would find soap of mine own enough to wash his linen or i would strain hard for't
how the mammet twitters
− come come my lady stays for us
would i had been her ladyship the last night
no more of that wench
exeunt hilario corisca and the rest
i am strangely troubled yet why i should nourish a fury here and with imagined food having no real grounds on which to raise a building of suspicion she was ever or can be false hereafter
i in this but foolishly enquire the knowledge of a future sorrow which if i find out my present ignorance were a cheap purchase though with my loss of being
i have already dealt with a friend of mine a general scholar one deeply read in nature's hidden secrets and though with much unwillingness have won him to do as much as art can to resolve me my fate that follows
− to my wish he's come
julio baptista now i may affirm your promise and performance walk together and therefore without circumstance to the point instruct me what i am
i could wish you had made trial of my love some other way
nay this is from the purpose
if you can proportion your desire to any mean i do pronounce you happy i have found by certain rules of art your matchless wife is to this present hour from all pollution free and untainted
in reason therefore you should fix here and make no further search of what may fall hereafter
o baptista 'tis not in me to master so my passions i must know further or you have made good but half your promise
while my love stood by holding her upright and my presence was a watch upon her her desires being met too with equal ardour from me what one proof could she give of her constancy being untempted
but when i am absent and my coming back uncertain and those wanton heats in women not to be quenched by lawful means and she the absolute disposer of herself without control or curb nay more invited by opportunity and all strong temptations if then she hold out − bapt
as no doubt she will
those doubts must be made certainties baptista by your assurance or your boasted art deserves no admiration
how you trifle and play with my affliction
i am on the rack till you confirm me
sure mathias i am no god nor can i dive into her hidden thoughts or know what her intents are that is denied to art and kept concealed even from the devils themselves they can but guess out of long observation what is likely but positively to fortell that shall be you may conclude impossible
all i can i will do for you when you are distant from her a thousand leagues as if you then were with her you shall know truly when she is solicited and how far wrought on
i desire no more
take then this little model of sophia with more than human skill limned to the life gives him a picture
each line and lineament of it in the drawing so punctually observed that had it motion in so much 'twere herself
it is indeed an admirable piece but if it have not some hidden virtue that i cannot guess at in what can it advantage me
i'll instruct you carry it still about you and as oft as you desire to know how she's affected with curious eyes peruse it while it keeps the figure it now has entire and perfit she is not only innocent in fact but unattempted but if once it vary from the true form and what's now white and red incline to yellow rest most confident she's with all violence courted but unconquered but if it turn all black 'tis an assurance the fort by composition or surprise is forced or with her free consent surrendered
how much you have engaged me for this favour the service of my whole life shall make good
we will not part so i'll along with you and it is needful with the rising sun the armies meet yet ere the fight begin in spite of opposition i will place you in the head of the hungarian general's troop and near his person
as my better angel you shall direct and guide me
as we ride i'll tell you more
in all things i'll obey you
i alba regalis hungary
a state room in the palace
enter ubaldo and ricardo
when came the post
yes as 'tis said and the letter writ and signed by the general ferdinand
nay then sans question it is of moment
it concerns the lives of two great armies
was it cheerfully received by the king
yes for being assured the armies were in view of one another having proclaimed a public fast and prayer for the good success he dispatched a gentleman of his privy chamber to the general with absolute authority from him to try the fortune of a day
no doubt then the general will come on and fight it bravely
this military art i grant to be the noblest of professions and yet i thank my stars for't i was never inclined to learn it since this bubble honour which is indeed the nothing soldiers fight for with the loss of limbs or life is in my judgment too dear a purchase
give me our court warfare the danger is not great in the encounter of a fair mistress
fair and sound together do very well ubaldo but such are with difficulty to be found out and when they know their value prized too high
by thy own report thou wast at twelve a gamester and since that studied all kinds of females from the night trader the street with certain danger to thy pocket to the great lady in her cabinet that spent upon thee more in cullises to strengthen thy weak back than would maintain twelve flanders mares and as many running horses besides apothecaries and chirurgeons' bills paid upon all occasions and those frequent
you talk ricardo as if yet you were a novice in those mysteries
by no means my doctor can assure the contrary i lose no time
i have felt the pain and pleasure as he that is a gamester and plays often must sometimes be a loser
wherefore then do you envy me
it grows not from my want nor thy abundance but being as i am the likelier man and of much more experience my good parts are my curses there's no beauty but yields ere it be summoned and as nature had signed me the monopoly of maidenheads there's none can buy till i have made my market
satiety cloys me as i live i would part with half my estate nay travel o'er the world to find that only phoenix in my search that could hold out against me
be not rapt so you may spare that labour
as she is a woman what think you of the queen
i dare not aim at the petticoat royal that is still excepted yet were she not my king's being the abstract of all that's rare or to be wished in woman to write her in my catalogue having enjoyed her i would venture my neck to a halter − but we talk of impossibilities as she hath a beauty would make old nestor young such majesty draws forth a sword of terror to defend it as would fright paris though the queen of love vowed her best furtherance to him
have you observed the gravity of her language mixed with sweetness
then at what distance she reserves herself when the king himself makes his approaches to her
as she were still a virgin and his life but one continued wooing
she well knows her worth and values it
and so far the king is indulgent to her humours that he forbears the duty of a husband but when she calls for't
all his imaginatiöns and thoughts are buried in her the loud noise of war cannot awake him
at this very instant when both his life and crown are at the stake he only studies her content and when she's pleased to shew herself music and masques are with all care and cost provided for her
this night she promised to appear
you may believe it by the diligence of the king as if he were her harbinger
enter ladislaus eubulus and attendants with perfumes
these rooms are not perfumed as we directed
i know not what you would have i am sure the smoke cost treble the price of the whole week's provision spent in your majesty's kitchens
how i scorn thy gross comparison
when my honoria the amazement of the present time and envy of all succeeding ages does descend to sanctify a place and in her presence makes it a temple to me can i be too curious much less prodigal to receive her
but that the splendour of her beams of beauty hath struck thee blind − eubu
as dotage hath done you
is it in me to serve her to her merit
is she not the daughter of a king
and you the son of ours i take it by what privilege else do you reign over us
for my part i know not where the disparity lies
her birth old man old in the kingdom's service which protects thee is the least grace in her and though her beauties might make the thunderer a rival for her they are but superficial ornaments and faintly speak her from her heavenly mind were all antiquity and fiction lost our modern poets could not in their fancy but fashion a minerva far transcending the imagined one whom homer only dreamt of
but then add this she's mine mine eubulus
and though she knows one glance from her fair eyes must make all gazers her idolaters she is so sparing of their influence that to shun superstitiön in others she shoots her powerful beams only at me
and can i then whom she desires to hold her kingly captive above all the world whose natiöns and empires if she pleased she might command as slaves but gladly pay the humble tribute of my love and service nay if i said of adoration to her i did not err
well since you hug your fetters in love's name wear them
you are a king and that concludes you wise your will a powerful reason which we that are foolish subjects must not argue
and what in a mean man i should call folly is in your majesty remarkable wisdom but for me i subscribe
do and look up upon this wonder
enter honoria in state under a canopy her train borne up by sylvia and acanthe
it is more sir
a rapture an astonishment
what think you sir
as the king thinks that is the surest guard we courtiers ever lie at
was prince ever so drowned in dotage
without spectacles i can see a handsome woman and she is so but yet to admiration look not on her
heaven how he fawns
and as it were his duty with what assurèd gravity she receives it
o she at length vouchsafes her lip and as he had sucked nectar from it how he's exalted
women in their natures affect command but this humility in a husband and a king marks her the way to absolute tyranny
the king seats her on his throne
juno's placed in jove's tribunal and like mercury forgetting his own greatness he attends for her employments
she prepares to speak what oracles shall we hear now
that you please sir with such assurances of love and favour to grace your handmaid but in being yours sir a matchless queen and one that knows herself so binds me in retribution to deserve the grace conferred upon me
you transcend in all things excellent and it is my glory your worth weighed truly to depose myself from absolute command surrendering up my will and faculties to your disposure and here i vow not for a day or year but my whole life which i wish long to serve you that whatsoever i in justice may exact from these my subjects you from me may boldly challenge and when you require it in sign of my subjection as your vassal thus i will pay my homage
let not my lips envy my robe on them print your allegiance often i desire no other fealty
is not here fine fooling
would i were gelt so that would disenchant him
though i forfeit my life for't i must speak
− by your good leave sir – i have no suit to you nor can you grant one having no power you are like me a subject her more than serene majesty being present
and i must tell you 'tis ill manners in you having deposed yourself to keep your hat on and not stand bare as we do being no king but a fellow subject with us
− gentlemen ushers it does belong to your place see it reformed he has given away his crown and cannot challenge the privilege of his bonnet
do not tempt me
in following your example
if you are angry question me hereafter as ladislaus should do eubulus on equal terms
you were of late my sovereign but weary of it i now bend my knee to her divinity and desire a boon from her more than magnificence
− nay be not moved for our mirth's sake let us hear him
'tis but to ask a question have you ne'er read the story of semiramis and ninus
not as i remember
i will then instruct you and 'tis to the purpose this ninus was a king and such an impotent loving king as this was but now he's none this ninus pray you observe me doted on this semiramis a smith's wife i must confess there the comparison holds not you are a king's daughter yet under your correction like her a woman this assyrian monarch of whom this is a pattern to express his love and service seated her as you are in his regal throne and bound by oath his nobles forgetting all allegiance to himself one day to be her subjects and to put in executiön whatever she pleased to impose upon them − pray you command him to minister the like to us and then you shall hear what followed
well sir to your story
you have no warrant stand by let me know your pleasure goddess
let this nod assure you
as i live a pretty idol
she knowing her power wisely made use of it and fearing his inconstancy and repentance of what he had granted as in reason madam you may do his that he might never have power to recall his grant or question her for her short government instantly gave order to have his head struck off
the story says so and commends her wisdom for making use of her authority
and it is worth your imitation madam he loves subjection and you are no queen unless you make him feel the weight of it
you are more than all the world to him and that he may be so to you and not seek change when his delights are sated mew him up in some close prison if you let him live which is no policy and there diet him as you think fit to feed your appetite since there ends his ambition
the queen appears too full of deep imaginations eubulus hath put both to it
now she seems resolved i long to know the issue
honoria descends from the throne
give me leave dear sir to reprehend you for appearing perplexed with what this old man out of envy of your unequal graces showered upon me hath in his fabulous story saucily applied to me
sir that you only nourish one doubt honoria dares abuse the power with which she is invested by your favour or that she ever can make use of it to the injury of you the great bestower takes from your judgment
it was your delight to seek to me with more obsequiousness than i desired and stood it with my duty not to receive what you were pleased to offer
i do but act the part you put upon me and though you make me personate a queen and you my subject when the play your pleasure is at a period i am what i was before i entered still your humble wife and you my royal sovereign
i have heard of captains taken more with dangers than the rewards and if in your approaches to those delights which are your own and freely to heighten your desire you make the passage narrow and difficult shall i prescribe you or blame your fondness
or can that swell me beyond my just proportion
heaven make me thankful for such goodness
now sir the state i took to satisfy your pleasure i change to this humility and the oath you made to me of homage i thus cancel and seat you in your own
leads the king to the throne
i am transported beyond myself
and now to your wise lordship am i proved a semiramis
or hath my ninus as maliciously you made him cause to repent the excess of favour to me which you call dotage
i dare sir and say however the event may plead in your defence you had a guilty cause nor was it wisdom in you i repeat it to teach a lady humble in herself with the ridiculous dotage of a lover to be ambitious
eubulus i am so tis rooted in me you mistake my temper
i do profess myself to be the most ambitious of my sex but not to hold command over my lord such a proud torrent would sink me in my wishes not that i am ignorant how much i can deserve and may with justice challenge
aside this i looked for after this seeming humble ebb i knew a gushing tide would follow
by my birth and liberal gifts of nature as of fortune from you as things beneath me i expect what's due to majesty in which i am a sharer with your sovereign
and as i am most eminent in place in all my actiöns i would appear so
you need not fear a rival
i hope not and till i find one i disdain to know what envy is
you are above it madam
for beauty without art discourse and free from affectation with what graces else can in the wife and daughter of a king be wished i dare prefer myself as − eubu
i blush for you lady
trumpet your own praises
this spoken by the people had been heard with honour to you
does the court afford no oil tongued parasite that you are forced to be your own gross flatterer
be dumb thou spirit of contradictiön
the wolf but barks against the moon and i contemn it
a horn sounded within
the masque you promised
here's one i fear unlooked for
the general victorious in your fortune kisses your hand in this sir
that great power who at his pleasure does dispose of battailes be ever praised for't
read sweet and partake it the turk is vanquished and with little loss upon our part in which our joy is doubled
but let it not exalt you bear it sir with moderation and pay what you owe for't
i understand thee eubulus
− i'll not now enquire particulars
− our delights deferred with reverence to the temples there we'll tender our souls' devotiöns to his dread might who edged our swords and taught us how to fight
a room in mathias' house
enter hilario and corisca
you like my speech
yes if you give it action in the delivery
i have played the fool before this is not the first time nor shall be i hope the last
nay i think so too
and if i put her not out of her dumps with laughter i'll make her howl for anger
not too much of that good fellow hilario our sad lady hath drank too often of that bitter cup a pleasant one must restore her
with what patience would she endure to hear of the death of my lord that merely out of doubt he may miscarry afflicts herself thus
'tis a question a widow only can resolve
there be some that in their husbands’ sicknesses have wept their pottle of tears a day but being once certain at midnight he was dead have in the morning dried up their handkerchiefs and thought no more on't
tush she is none of that race if her sorrow be not true and perfit i against my sex will take my oath woman ne'er wept in earnest
she has made herself a prisoner to her chamber dark as a dungeon in which no beam of comfort enters
she admits no visits eats little and her nightly music is of sighs and groans tuned to such harmony of feeling grief that i against my nature am made one of the consort
this hour only she takes the air a custom every day she solemnly observes with greedy hopes from some that pass by to receive assurance of the success and safety of her lord
now if that your device will take − hil
ne'er fear it i am provided cap à pe and have my properties in readiness
within bring my veil there
be gone i hear her coming
if i do not appear and what's more appear perfit hiss me
i was flattered once i was a star but now turned a prodigious meteor and like one hang in the air between my hopes and fears and every hour the little stuff burnt out that yields a waning light to dying comfort i do expect my fall and certain ruin
in wretched things more wretched is delay and hope a parasite to me being unmasked appears more horrid than despair and my distraction worse than madness
even my prayers when with most zeal sent upward are pulled down with strong imaginary doubts and fears and in their sudden precipice o'erwhelm me
dreams and fantastic visions walk the round about my widowed bed and every slumber's broken with loud alarms can these be then but sad presages girl
you make them so and antedate a loss shall ne'er fall on you
such pure affectiön such mutual love a bed and undefiled on either part a house without contention in two bodies one will and soul like to the rod of concord kissing each other cannot be short lived or end in barrenness
− if all these dear madam sweet in your sadness should produce no fruit or leave the age no models of yourselves to witness to posterity what you were succeeding times frighted with the example but hearing of your story would instruct their fairest issue to meet sensually like other creatures and forbear to raise true love or hymen altars
o corisca i know thy reasons are like to thy wishes and they are built upon a weak foundation to raise me comfort
ten long days are past ten long days my corisca since my lord embarked himself upon a sea of danger in his dear care of me
and if his life had not been shipwracked on the rock of war his tenderness of me knowing how much i languish for his absence had provided some trusty friend from whom i might receive assurance of his safety
ill news madam are swallow winged but what's good walks on crutches with patiënce expect it and ere long no doubt you shall hear from him
a sowgelder's horn without
aside the fool has got a sowgelder's horn
− a post as i take it madam
it makes this way still nearer and nearer
from the camp i hope
enter a post with a horn followed by hilario in antic armour with long white hair and beard
the messenger appears and in strange armour heaven
if it be thy will − hil
it is no boot to strive our horses tired let's walk on foot and that the castle which is very near us to give us entertainment may soon hear us blow lustily my lad and drawing nigh a ask for a lady which is cleped sophia
he names you madam
for to her i bring thus clad in arms news of a pretty thing by name mathias
o sir i am sophia that mathias' wife
so may mars favour you in all your battailes as you with speed unload me of the burthen i labour under till i am confirmed both where and how you left him
if thou art as i believe the pigsney of his heart know he's in health and what's more full of glee and so much i was willed to say to thee
have you no letters from him
in the camp we use no pens but write with swords yet as i am enjoined by word of mouth i will proclaim his deeds from north to south but tremble not while i relate the wonder though my eyes like lightning shine and my voice thunder
this is some counterfeit braggart
the rear marched first which followed by the van and winged with the battalia no man durst stay to shift a shirt or louse himself yet ere the armies joined that hopeful elf thy dear thy dainty duckling bold mathias advanced and stared like hercules or golias
a hundred thousand turks it is no vaunt assailed him every one a termagaunt but what did he then
with his keen edge spear he cut and carbonated them here and there lay legs and arms and as 'tis said truly of bevis some he quartered all in three
i must take breath then like a nightingale i'll sing his death
aside to corisca i am out
how he escaped i should have sung not died for though a knight when i said so i lied
weary he was and scarce could stand upright and looking round for some courageous knight to rescue him as one perplexed in woe he called to me help help hilario
my valiant servant help
he has spoiled all
are you the man of arms then
i'll make bold to take off your martial beard you had fool's hair enough without it
how durst thou make thy sport of what concerns me more than life in such an antic fashion
am i grown contemptible to those i feed
− you minion had a hand in it too as it appears your petticoat serves for bases to this warrior
we did it for your mirth
for myself i hope i have spoke like a soldier
i never but with reverence name my lord and can i hear it by thy tongue profaned and not correct thy folly
but you are transformed and turned knight errant take your course and wander where you please for here i vow by my lord's life an oath i will not break till his return or certainty of his safety my doors are shut against thee
you have made a fine piece of work on't
how do you like the quality
you had a foolish itch to be an actor and may stroll where you please
will you buy my share
no certainly i fear i have already too much of mine own i'll only as a damsel as the books say thus far help to disarm you and so dear don quixote taking my leave i leave you to your fortune
have i sweat my brains out for this quaint and rare invention and am i thus rewarded
i could turn tragedian and roar now but that i fear 'twould get me too great a stomach having no meat to pacify colon what will become of me
i cannot beg in armour and steal i dare not my end must be to stand in a corn field and fright away the crows for bread and cheese or find some hollow tree in the highway and there until my lord return sell switches no more hilario but dolorio now i'll weep my eyes out and be blind of purpose to move compassiön and so i vanish
an ante room in the palace
enter eubulus ubaldo ricardo and others
are the gentlemen sent before as it was ordered by the king's directiön to entertain the general
long since they by this have met him and given him the bienvenu
i hope i need not instruct you in your parts
fear not we know our distances and degrees to the very inch where we are to salute him
the state were miserable if the court had none of her own breed familiar with all garbs gracious in england italy spain or france with form and punctuality to receive stranger ambassadors for the general he's a mere native and it matters not which way we do accost him
tis great pity that such as sit at the helm provide no better for the training up of the gentry
in my judgment an academy erected with large pensions to such as in a table could set down the congees cringes postures methods phrase proper to every nation − ric
o it were an admirable piece of work
and yet rich fools throw away their charity on hospitals for beggars and lame soldiers and ne'er study the due regard to compliment and courtship matters of more import and are indeed the glories of a monarchy
these no doubt are state points gallants i confess but sure our court needs no aids this way since it is a school of nothing else
there are some of you whom i forbear to name whose coining heads are the mints of all new fashions that have done more hurt to the kingdom by superfluous bravery which the foolish gentry imitate than a war or a long famine all the treasure by this foul excess is got into the merchant embroiderer silkman jeweller tailor's hand and the third part of the land too the nobility engrossing titles only
my lord you are bitter
the general is alighted and now entered
were he ten generals i am prepared and know what i will do
pray you what ricardo
i'll fight at compliment with him
i'll charge home too
and that's a desperate service if you come off well
enter ferdinand mathias baptista and two captains
captain command the officers to keep the soldier as he marched in rank and file till they hear further from me
here's one speaks in another key this is no canting language taught in your academy
nay i will present you to the king myself
a grace beyond my merit
you undervalue what i cannot set too high a price on
with a friend's true heart i gratulate your return
next to the favour of the great king i am happy in your friendship
by courtship coarse on both sides
pray you receive this stranger to your knowledge on my credit at all parts he deserves it
your report is a strong assurance to me
this said by you the reverence of your age commands me to believe it
this was pretty but second me now
− i cannot stoop too low to do your excellence that due observance your fortune claims
he ne'er thinks on his virtue
for being as you are the soul of soldiers and bulwark of bellona − ubald
the protection both of the court and king − ric
and the sole minion of mighty mars − ubald
one that with justice may increase the number of the worthies − eubu
it being impossible in my arms to circle such giant worth − ubald
at distance we presume to kiss your honoured gauntlet
what reply now can he make to this foppery
you have said gallants so much and hitherto done so little that till i learn to speak and you to do i must take time to thank you
as i live answered as i could wish
how the fops gape now
this was harsh and scurvy
we will be revenged when he comes to court the ladies and laugh at him
nay do your offices gentlemen and conduct the general to the presence
make way for the general
exeunt all but eubulus
what wise man that with judicious eyes looks on a soldier but must confess that fortune's swinge is more o'er that profession than all kinds else of life pursued by man
they in a state are but as chirurgeöns to wounded men e'en desperate in their hopes while pain and anguish make them blaspheme and call in vain for death their wives and children kiss the chirurgeon's knees promise him mountains if his saving hand restore the tortured wretch to former strength
but when grim death by æsculapius' art is frighted from the house and health appears in sanguine colours on the sick man's face all is forgot and asking his reward he's paid with curses often receives wounds from him whose wounds he cured so soldiers though of more worth and use meet the same fate as it is too apparent
i have observed when horrid mars the touch of whose rough hand with palsies shakes a kingdom hath put on his dreadful helmet and with terror fills the place where he like an unwelcome guest resolves to revel how the lords of her like the tradesman merchant and litigious pleader and such like scarabs bred in the dung of peace in hope of their protection humbly offer their daughters to their beds heirs to their service and wash with tears their sweat their dust their scars but when those clouds of war that menaced a bloody deluge to the affrighted state are by their breath dispersed and over blown and famine blood and death bellona's pages whipt from the quiet continent to thrace soldiers that like the foolish hedge sparrow to their own ruin hatch this cuckoo peace are straight thought burthensome since want of means growing from want of action breeds contempt and that the worst of ills falls to their lot their service with the danger soon forgot
the queen my lord hath made choice of this room to see the masque
i'll be a looker on my dancing days are past

as they pass a song in praise of war
this courtesy to a stranger my honoria keeps fair rank with all your rarities
− after your travail look on our court delights but first from your relation with erected ears i'll hear the music of your war which must be sweet ending in victory
not to trouble your majesties with description of a battle too full of horror for the place and to avoid particulars which should i deliver i must trench longer on your patience than my manners will give way to − in a word sir it was well fought on both sides and almost with equal fortune it continuing doubtful upon whose tents plumed victory would take her glorious stand
impatient of delay with the flower of our prime gentlemen i charged their main battalia and with their assistance brake in but when i was almost assured that they were routed by a stratagem of the subtile turk who opening his gross body and rallying up his troops on either side i found myself so far engaged for i must not conceal my errors that i knew not which way with honour to come off
i like a general that tells his faults and is not ambitious to engross unto himself all honour as some have in which with justice they could not claim a share
being thus hemmed in their scimitars raged among us and my horse killed under me i every minute looked for an honourable end and that was all my hope could fashion to me circled thus with death and horror as one sent from heaven this man of men with some choice horse that followed his brave example did pursue the tract his sword cut for them and but that i see him already blush to hear what he being present i know would wish unspoken i should say sir by what he did we boldly may believe all that is writ of hector
general pray spare these strange hyperboles
do not blush to hear a truth here are a pair of monsieurs had they been in your place would have run away and ne'er changed countenance
we have your good word still
and shall while you deserve it
he as i said like dreadful lightning thrown from jupiter's shield dispersed the armèd gyre with which i was environed horse and man shrunk under his strong arm more with his looks frighted the valiant fled with which encouraged my soldiers like young eaglets preying under the wings of their fierce dam as if from him they took both spirit and fire bravely came on
by him i was remounted and inspired with treble courage and such as fled before boldly made head again and to confirm them it suddenly was apparent that the fortune of the day was ours each soldier and commander performed his part but this was the great wheel by which the lesser moved and all rewards and signs of honour as the civic garland the mural wreath the enemy's prime horse with the general's sword and armour the old honours with which the romans crowned their several leaders to him alone are proper
and they shall deservedly fall on him
sit 'tis our pleasure
which i must serve not argue
you are a stranger but in your service for the king a native and though a free queen i am bound in duty to cherish virtue wheresoe'er i find it this place is yours
it were presumption in me to sit so near you
not having our warrant
let the masquers enter by the preparation 'tis a french brawl an apish imitation of what you really perform in battaile and pallas bound up in a little volume apollo with his lute attending on her serve for the induction
enter two boys dressed as apollo with his lute and pallas a dance after which a song by pallas in praise of the victorious soldiers
though we contemplate to express the glory of your happiness that by your powerful arm have been so true a victor that no sin could ever taint you with a blame to lessen your deserved fame
or though we contend to set your worth in the full height or get celestial singers crowned with bays with flourishes to dress your praise you know your conquest but your story lives in your triumphant glory
our thanks to all
to the banquet that's prepared to entertain them exeunt masquers apollo and pallas
what would my best honoria
may it please my king that i who by his suffrage ever have had power to command may now entreat an honour from him
why should you desire what is your own
whate'er it be you are the mistress of it
i am happy in your grant my suit sir is that your commanders especially this stranger may as i in my discretion shall think good receive what's due to their deserts
what you determine shall know no alteratiön
the soldier is like to have good usage when he depends upon her pleasure
are all the men so bad that to give satisfaction we must have a woman treasurer
to mathias with you sir i will begin and as in my esteem you are most eminent expect to have what's fit for me to give and you to take
the favour in the quick dispatch being double − go fetch my casket and with speed
the kingdom is very bare of money when rewards issue from the queen's jewel house
give him gold and store no questiön the gentleman wants it
− good madam what shall he do with a hoop ring and a spark of diamond in it though you take it re enter acanthe with a casket
for the greater honour from your majesty's finger
'twill not increase the value
he must purchase rich suits the gay caparisons of courtship revel and feast which the war ended is a soldier's glory and 'tis fit that way your bounty should provide for him
you are rude and by your narrow thoughts proportion mine
what i will do now shall be worth the envy of cleopatra
open it see here honoria descends from the state
gold is trash and a poor salary fit for grooms wear these as studded stars in your armour and make the sun look dim with jealousy of a greater light than his beams gild the day with when it is exposed to view call it honoria's gift the queen honoria's gift that loves a soldier and to give ornament and lustre to him parts freely with her own
yet not to take from the magnificence of the king i will dispense his bounty too but as a page to wait on mine for other tosses take a hundred thousand crowns − your hand dear sir − takes off the king's signet
and this shall be thy warrant
i perceive i was cheated in this woman now she is in the giving vein to soldiers let her be proud and the king dote so she go on i care not
this done our pleasure is that all arrearages be paid unto the captains and their troops with a large donative to increase their zeal for the service of the kingdom
better still let men of arms be used thus if they do not charge desperately upon the cannon's mouth though the devil roared and fight like dragons hang me
now they may drink sack but small beer with a passport to beg with as they travel and no money turns their red blood to buttermilk
are you pleased sir with what i have done
yes and thus confirm it with this addition of mine own you have sir from our loved queen received some recompense for your life hazarded in the late action and that we may follow her great example in cherishing valour without limit ask what you from us can wish
if it be true dread sir as 'tis affirmed that every soil where he is well is to a valiant man his natural country reason may assure me i should fix here where blessings beyond hope from you the spring like rivers flow unto me
if wealth were my ambition by the queen i am made rich already to the amazement of all that see or shall hereafter read the story of her bounty if to spend the remnant of my life in deeds of arms no region is more fertile of good knights from whom my knowledge that way may be bettered than this your warlike hungary if favour or grace in court could take me by your grant far far beyond my merit i may make in yours a free election but alas
sir i am not mine own but by my destiny which i cannot resist forced to prefer my country's smoke before the glorious fire with which your bounties warm me
all i ask sir though i cannot be ignorant it must relish of foul ingratitude is your gracious license for my departure
to my own home sir my own poor home which will at my return grow rich by your magnificence
i am here but a body without a soul and till i find it in the embraces of my constant wife and to set off that constancy in her beauty and matchless excellencies without a rival i am but half myself
and is she then so chaste and fair as you infer
o madam though it must argue weakness in a rich man to shew his gold before an armèd thief and i in praising of my wife but feed the fire of lust in others to attempt her such is my full sailed confidence in her virtue though in my absence she were now besieged by a strong army of lascivious wooers and every one more expert in his art than those that tempted chaste penelope though they raised batteries by prodigal gifts by amorous letters vows made for her service with all the engines wanton appetite could mount to shake the fortress of her honour here here is my assurance she holds out kisses the picture
as i live an excellent face
you have seen a better
i ever except yours − nay frown not sweetest the cyprian queen compared to you in my opinion is a negro
as you ordered i'll see the soldiers paid and in my absence pray use your powerful arguments to stay this gentleman in our service
i will do my part
on to the camp
exeunt ladislaus ferdinand eubulus baptista captains and others
aside i am full of thoughts and something there is here i must give form to though yet an embryon − you signiors have no business with the soldier as i take it you are for other warfare quit the place but be within call
employment on my life boy
if it lie in our road we are made for ever
exeunt ubaldo and ricardo
you may perceive the king is no way tainted with the disease of jealousy since he leaves me thus private with you
it were in him madam a sin unpardonable to distrust such pureness though i were an adonis
i presume he neither does nor dares and yet the story delivered of you by the general with your heroic courage which sinks deeply into a knowing woman's heart besides your promising presence might beget some scruple in a meaner man but more of this hereafter
i'll take another theme now and conjure you by the honours you have won and by the love sacred to your dear wife to answer truly to what i shall demand
you need not use charms to this purpose madam
tell me then being yourself assured 'tis not in man to sully with one spot th' immaculate whiteness of your wife's honour if you have not since the gordian of your love was tied by marriage played false with her
by the hopes of mercy never
it may be not frequenting the converse of handsome ladies you were never tempted and so your faith's untried yet
surely madam i am no woman hater i have been received to the society of the best and fairest of our climate and have met with no common entertainment yet ne'er felt the least heat that way
and do you think still the earth can show no beauty that can drench in lethe all remembrance of the favour you now bear to your own
nature must find out some other mould to fashion a new creature fairer than her pandora ere i prove guilty or in my wishes or my thoughts to my sophia
sir consider better not one in our whole sex
i am constant to my resolutiön
but dare you stand the oppositiön and bind yourself by oath for the performance
my faith else had but a weak foundation
i take hold upon your promise and enjoin your stay for one month here
aside i am caught
and if i do not produce a lady in that time that shall make you confess your error i submit myself to any penalty you shall please to impose upon me in the mean space write to your chaste wife acquaint her with your fortune the jewèls that were mine you may send to her for better confirmation i'll provide you of trusty messengers but how far distant is she
a day's hard riding
there is no retiring i’ll bind you to your word
well since there is no way to shun it i will stand the hazard and instantly make ready my dispatch till then i'll leave your majesty
how i burst with envy that there lives besides myself one fair and loyal woman
'twas the end of my ambitiön to be recorded the only wonder of the age and shall i give way to a competitor
nay more to add to my affliction the assurances that i placed in my beauty have deceived me i thought one amorous glance of mine could bring all hearts to my subjection but this stranger unmoved as rocks contemns me
but i cannot sit down so with mine honour i will gain a double victory by working him to my desire and taint her in her honour or lose myself i have read that sometime poison is useful
− to supplant her i'll employ with any cost ubaldo and ricardo two noted courtiers of approvèd cunning in all the windings of lust's labyrinth and in corrupting him i will outgo nero's poppӕa if he shut his ears against my siren notes i'll boldly swear ulysses lives again or that i have found a frozen cynic cold in spite of all allurements one whom beauty cannot move nor softest blandishments entice to love
a space near the entrance to mathias’ house
enter hilario with a pitcher of water and a wallet
i am dieted like one set to watch hawks and to keep me waking my croaking guts make a perpetual larum
here i stand sentinel and though i fright beggars from my lady's gate in hope to have a greater share i find my commons mend not
i looked this morning in my glass the river and there appeared a fish called a poor john cut with a lenten face in my own likeness and it seemed to speak and say good morrow cousin
no man comes this way but has a fling at me a chirurgeon passing by asked at what rate i would sell myself i answered for what use
to make said he a living anatomy and set thee up in our hall for thou art transparent without dissection and indeed he had reason for i am scoured with this poor purge to nothing
they say that hunger dwells in the camp but till my lord returns or certain tidings of him he will not part with me − but sorrow's dry and i must drink howsoever
enter ubaldo ricardo and a guide
that's her castle upon my certain knowledge
our horses held out to my desire
i am afire to be at it
take the jades for thy reward before i part hence i hope to be better carried
give me the cabinet so leave us now
good fortune to you gallants
being joint agents in a design of trust too for the service of the queen and our own pleasure let us proceed with judgment
if i take not this fort at the first assault make me an eunuch so i may have precedence
we are both to play one prize he that works best in the searching of this mine shall carry it without contention
make you your approaches as i directed
i need no instruction i work not on your anvil
i'll give fire with mine own linstock if the powder be dank the devil rend the touch hole
who have we here
or the image of famine
where dost thou dwell
my dwelling is in the highway that goodly house was once my habitatiön but i am banished and cannot be called home till news arrive of the good knight mathias
if that will restore thee thou art safe
we come from him with presents to his lady
but are you sure he is in health
never so well conduct us to the lady
though a poor snake i will leap out of my skin for joy
and wallet late my cupboard i bequeath thee to the next beggar thou red herring swim to the red sea again methinks i am already knuckle deep in the fleshpots and though waking dream of wine and plenty
what's the mystery of this strange passiön
my belly gentlemen will not give me leave to tell you when i have brought you to my lady's presence i am disenchanted there you shall know all
follow if i outstrip you know i run for my belly
a room in mathias' house
enter sophia and corisca
do not again delude me
if i do send me a grazing with my fellow hilario
i stood as you commanded in the turret observing all that passed by and even now i did discern a pair of cavaliers for such their outside spoke them with their guide dismounting from their horses they said something to our hungry sentinel that made him caper and frisk i' the air for joy and to confirm this see madam they're in view
enter hilario ubaldo and ricardo
news from my lord
these are no counterfeits but knights indeed
dear madam sign my pardon that i may feed again and pick up my crumbs i have had a long fast of it
eat i forgive thee
eat i forgive thee
and if in this i do not soon obey you and ram in to the purpose billet me again in the highway
butler and cook be ready for i enter like a tyrant
since mine eyes were never happy in so sweet an object without inquiry i presume you are the lady of the house and so salute you
this letter with these jewèls from your lord warrant my boldness madam
delivers a letter and a casket
in being a servant to such rare beauty you must needs deserve this courtesy from a stranger
you are still beforehand with me
− pretty one i descend to take the height of your lip and if i miss in the altitude hereafter if you please i will make use of my jacob's staff
these gentlemen have certainly had good breeding as it appears by their neat kissing they hit me so pat on the lips at the first sight
in the interim sophia reads the letter and opens the casket
heaven in thy mercy make me thy thankful handmaid for this boundless blessing in thy goodness showered upon me
i do not like this simple devotion in her it is seldom practised among my mistresses
would they kneel to i know not who for the possession of such inestimable wealth before they thanked the bringers of it
the poor lady does want instruction but i'll be her tutor and read her another lesson
if i have shown want of manners gentlemen in my slowness to pay the thanks i owe you for your travail to do my lord and me howe'er unworthy of such a benefit this noble favour impute it in your clemency to the excess of joy that overwhelmed me
and howe'er it may increase the offence to trouble you with more demands touching my lord before i have invited you to taste such as the coarseness of my poor house can offer pray you connive on my weak tenderness though i entreat to learn from you something he hath it may be in his letter left unmentioned
i can only give you assurance that he is in health graced by the king and queen
and in the court with admiration looked on
you must therefore put off these widow's garments and appear like to yourself
and entertain all pleasures your fortune marks out for you
there are other particular privacies which on occasion i will deliver to you
you oblige me to your service ever
"your service" mark that
in the mean time by your good acceptance make my rustic entertainment relish of the curiousness of the court
your looks sweet madam cannot but make each dish a feast
it shall be such in the freedom of my will to please you
i'll shew you the way this is too great an honour from such brave guests to me so mean an hostess
an outer room in the palace
enter acanthe and four or five servants in vizards
you know your charge give it action and expect rewards beyond your hopes
if we but eye them they are ours i warrant you
may we not ask why we are put upon this
let that stop your mouth gives them money
and learn more manners groom
'tis upon the hour in which they use to walk here when you have them in your power with violence carry them to the place where i appointed there i will expect you be bold and careful
enter mathias and baptista
am i sure i am myself
cease on him strongly if he have but means to draw his sword 'tis ten to one we smart for't take all advantages
i cannot guess what her intents are but her carriage was as i but now related
your assurance in the constancy of your lady is the armour that must defend you
here and no way altered
if she be not perfit there is no truth in art
by this i hope she hath received my letters
without question these courtiers are rank riders when they are to visit a handsome lady
lend me your ear
one piece of her entertainment will require your dearest privacy
now they stand fair upon them
we come not to try your valours kill him if he offer to ope his mouth
− we have you 'tis in vain to make resistance
mount them and away
exeunt with mathias and baptista
a gallery in the same
enter servants with lights ladislaus ferdinand and eubulus
go to your rest but do not envy the happiness i draw near to
if you enjoy it the moderate way the sport yields i confess a pretty titillation but too much of’t will bring you on your knees
in my younger days i was myself a gamester and i found by sad experience there is no such soaker as a young spongy wife she keeps a thousand horse leeches in her box and the thieves will suck out both blood and marrow
i feel a kind of cramp in my joints when i think on't but it may be queens and such a queen as yours is has the art − ferd
you take leave to talk my lord
he may since he can do nothing
if you spend this way too much of your royal stock ere long we may be pewfellows
− knock gently harder
so here comes her woman
take off my gown
my lord the queen by me this night desires your pardon
i come by her appointment 'twas her grant the motion was her own
it may be sir but by her doctors she is since advised for her health's sake to forbear eubu
i do not like this physical letchery the old downright way is worth a thousand on't
prithee acanthe mediate for me
offering her a ring
o the fiends of hell
would any man bribe his servant to make way to his own wife
if this be the court state shame fall on such as use it
by this jewel this night i dare not move her but to morrow i will watch all occasiöns
take this to be mindful of me
'slight i thought a king might have ta'en up any woman at the king's price
and must he buy his own at a dearer rate than a stranger in a brothel
what is that you mutter sir
no treason to your honour i'll speak it out though it anger you if you pay for your lawful pleasure in some kind great sir what do you make the queen
cannot you clicket without a fee or when she has a suit for you to grant
ladislaus draws his sword
off with his head
do when you please you but blow out a taper that would light your understanding and in care of’t is burnt down to the socket
be as you are sir an absolute monarch it did show more king like in those libidinous caesars that compelled matrons and virgins of all ranks to bow unto their ravenous lusts and did admit of more excuse than i can urge for you that slave yourself to the imperious humour of a proud beauty
out of my sight
i will sir give way to your furious passion but when reason hath got the better of it i much hope the counsaile that offends now will deserve your royal thanks
tranquillity of mind stay with you sir
− aside i do begin to doubt there's something more in the queen's strangeness than is yet disclosed and i will find it out or lose myself in the search
sure he is honest and from your infancy hath truly served you let that plead for him and impute this harshness to the frowardness of his age
i am much troubled and do begin to stagger
to morrow visit us
back to our own lodgings
another room in the same
enter acanthe and the vizarded servants with mathias and baptista blindfolded
you have done bravely
lock this in that room there let him ruminate i'll anon unhood him they carry off baptista
the other must stay here
as soon as i have quit the place give him the liberty and use of his eyes that done disperse yourselves as privately as you can but on your lives no word of what hath passed
if i do sell my tongue to a tripe wife
− come unbind his arms − you are now at your own disposure and however we used you roughly i hope you will find here such entertainment as will give you cause to thank us for the service and so i leave you
if i am in prison 'tis a neat one
what oedipus can resolve this riddle
i never gave just cause to any man basely to plot against my life − but what is become of my true friend
for him i suffer more than myself
within remove that idle fear he's safe as you are
whosoe'er thou art for him i thank thee
i cannot imagine where i should be though i have read the tales of errant knighthood stuffed with the relations of magical enchantments yet i am not so sottishly credulous to believe the devil hath that way power
singing from above a song of pleasure
the blushing rose and purple flower let grow too long are soonest blasted dainty fruits though sweet will sour and rot in ripeness left untasted
yet here is one more sweet than these the more you taste the more she'll please
beauty that's enclosed with ice is a shadow chaste as rare then how much those sweets entice that have issue full as fair
earth cannot yield from all her powers one equal for dame venus' bowers
certainly be it he or she that owes this voice it hath not been acquainted with much affliction
whosoe'er you are that do inhabit here if you have bodies and are not mere aërial forms appear enter honoria masked
and make me know your end with me
what have i conjured up
sure if this be a spirit it is no damned one
what a shape's here
then with what majesty it moves
if juno were now to keep her state among the gods and hercules to be made again her guest she could not put on a more glorious habit though her handmaid iris lent her various colours or old oceanus ravished from the deep all jewèls shipwracked in it
− as you have thus far made known yourself if that your face have not too much divinity about it for mortal eyes to gaze on pérfit what you have begun with wonder and amazement to my astonished senses
honoria pulls off her mask
rise sir and hear my reasons in defence of the rape for so you may conceive which i by my instruments made upon you
you perhaps may think what you have suffered for my lust is a common practice with me but i call those ever shining lamps and their great maker as witnesses of my innocence i ne'er looked on a man but your best self on whom i ever except the king vouchsafed an eye of favour
the king indeed and only such a king deserves your rarities madam and but he 'twere giant like ambitiön in any in his wishes only to presume to taste the nectar of your kisses or to feed his appetite with that ambrosia due and proper to a prince and what binds more a lawful husband
for myself great queen i am a thing obscure disfurnished of all merit that can raise me higher than in my most humble thankfulness for your bounty to hazard my life for you and that way i am most ambitious
i desire no more than what you promise
if you dare expose your life as you profess to do me service how can it be better employed than in preserving mine
which only you can do and must do with the danger of your own a desperate danger too
if private men can brook no rivals in what they affect but to the death pursue such as invade what law makes their inheritance the king to whom you know i am dearer than his crown his health his eyes his after hopes with all his present blessings must fall on that man like dreadful lightning that is won by prayers threats or rewards to stain his bed or make his hoped for issue doubtful
if you aim at what i more than fear you do the reasons which you deliver should in judgment rather deter me than invite a grant with my assurèd ruin
true if that you were of a cold temper one whom doubt or fear in the most horrid forms they could put on might teach to be ingrateful
your denial to me that have deserved so much is more if it can have addition
i know not what your commands are
have you fought so well among armed men yet cannot guess what lists you are to enter when you are in private with a willing lady one that to enjoy your company this night denied the king access to what's his own
if you will press me to speak in plainer language − math
pray you forbear i would i did not understand too much
already by your words i am instructed to credit that which not confirmed by you had bred suspicion in me of untruth though an angel had affirmed it
but suppose that cloyed with happiness which is ever built on virtuous chastity in the wantonness of appetite you desire to make trial of the false delights proposed by vicious lust among ten thousand every way more able and apter to be wrought on such as owe you obedience being your subjects why should you make choice of me a stranger
though yet reason was ne'er admitted in the court of love i'll yield you one unanswerable
as i urged in our last private conference you have a pretty promising presence but there are many in limbs and feature who may take that way the right hand file of you besides your may of youth is past and the blood spent by wounds though bravely taken renders you disabled for love's service and that valour set off with better fortune which it may be swells you above your bounds is not the hook that hath caught me good sir
i need no champion with his sword to guard my honour or my beauty in both i can defend myself and live my own protection
if these advocates the best that can plead for me have no power what can you find in me else that may tempt you with irrecoverable loss unto yourself to be a gainer from me
you have sir a jewèl of such matchless worth and lustre as does disdain comparison and darkens all that is rare in other men and that i must or win or lessen
you heap more amazement on me what am i possessed of that you can covet
make me understand it if it have a name
yes an imagined one but is in substance nothing being a garment worn out of fashion and long since given o'er by the court and country 'tis your loyalty and constancy to your wife 'tis that i dote on and does deserve my envy and that jewel or by fair play or foul i must win from you
these are mere contraries
if you love me madam for my constancy why seek you to destroy it
in my keeping it preserve me worth your favour
or if it be a jewèl of that value as you with laboured rhetoric would persuade me what can you stake against it
a queen's fame and equal honour
so whoever wins both shall be losers
that is that i aim at yet on the die i lay my youth my beauty this moist palm this soft lip and those delights darkness should only judge of
do you find them infectious in the trial that you start as frighted with their touch
is it in man to resist such strong temptations
aside he begins to waver
madam as you are gracious grant this short night's deliberation to me and with the rising sun from me you shall receive full satisfaction
though extremes hate all delay i will deny you nothing this key will bring you to your friend you are safe both and all things useful that could be prepared for one i love and honour wait upon you
take counsaile of your pillow such a fortune as with affection's swiftest wings flies to you will not be often tendered
how my blood rebels
i now could call her back − and yet there's something stays me if the king had tendered such favours to my wife 'tis to be doubted they had not been refused but being a man i should not yield first or prove an example for her defence of frailty
by this sans question she's tempted too and here i may examine looks on the picture
how she holds out
she's still the same the same pure crystal rock of chastity
perish all allurements that may alter me
the snow of her sweet coldness hath extinguished quite the fire that but even now began to flame and i by her confirmed − rewards nor titles nor certain death from the refusèd queen shall shake my faith since i resolve to be loyal to her as she is true to me
a gallery in mathias' house
enter ubaldo and ricardo
what we spake on the volley begins to work we have laid a good foundation
build it up or else 'tis nothing you have by lot the honour of the first assault but as it is conditioned observe the time proportioned i'll not part with my share in the achievement when i whistle or hem fall off
stand by i'll watch my opportunity
i find myself strangely distracted with the various stories now well now ill then doubtfully by my guests delivered of my lord and like poor beggars that in their dreams find treasure by reflection of a wounded fancy make it questionable whether they sleep or not yet tickled with such a fantastic hope of happiness wish they may never wake
in some such measure incredulous of what i see and touch as 'twere a fading apparition i am still perplexed and troubled and when most confirmed 'tis true a curious jealousy to be assured by what means and from whom such a mass of wealth was first deserved then gotten cunningly steals into me
i have practised for my certain resolution with these courtiers
promising private conference to either and at this hour if in search of the truth i hear or say more than becomes my virtue forgive me my mathias
now i make in
madam as you commanded i attend your pleasure
i must thank you for the favour
i am no ghostly father yet if you have some scruples touching your lord you would be resolved of i am prepared
but will you take your oath to answer truly
on the hem of your smock if you please a vow i dare not break it being a book i would gladly swear on
to spare sir that trouble i'll take your word which in a gentleman should be of equal value
is my lord then in such grace with the queen
you should best know by what you have found from him whether he can deserve a grace or no
what grace do you mean
that special grace if you will have it he laboured so hard for between a pair of sheets upon your wedding night when your ladyship lost you know what
be more modest or i must leave you
i would tell a truth as cleanly as i could and yet the subject makes me run out a little
you would put now a foolish jealousy in my head my lord hath gotten a new mistress
a hundred but under seal i speak it i presume upon your silence it being for your profit
they talk of hercules' fifty in a night twas well but yet to yours he was a piddler such a soldier and a courtier never came to alba regalis the ladies run mad for him and there is such contentiön among them who shall engross him wholly that the like was never heard of
are they handsome women
no coarse mammets and what's worse they are old too some fifty some threescore and they pay dear for't believing that he carries a powder in his breeches will make them young again and these suck shrewdly
aside to ubaldo sir i must fetch you off
i could tell you wonders of the cures he has done but a business of import calls me away but that dispatched i will be with you presently
there is something more in this than bare suspicion
comes forward save you lady now you look like yourself
i have not looked on a lady more complete yet have seen a madam wear a garment of this fashion of the same stuff too one just of your dimensions sat the wind there boy
nay nothing and methinks i should know this ruby very good
this chain of orient pearl and this diamond too have been worn before but much good may they do you
strength to the gentleman's back
he toiled hard for them before he got them
why how were they gotten
not in the field with his sword upon my life he may thank his close stiletto
− aside plague upon it
run the minutes so fast
− pray you excuse my manners i left a letter in my chamber window which i would not have seen on any terms fie on it forgetful as i am
but i'll straight attend you
his letters said these jewèls were presented him by the queen as a reward for his good service and the trunks of clothes that followed them this last night with haste made up by his direction
comes forward i was telling you of wonders madam
if you are so skilful without premeditation answer me know you this gown and these rich jewèls
heaven how things will come out
but that i should offend you and wrong my more than noble friend your husband for we are sworn brothers in the discovery of his nearest secrets i could − soph
by the hope of favour that you have from me out with it
'tis a potent spell i cannot resist why i will tell you madam and to how many several women you are beholding for your bravery
this was the wedding gown of paulina a rich strumpet worn but a day when she married old gonzaga and left off trading
this chain of pearl was a great widow's that invited your lord to a masque and the weather proving foul he lodged in her house all night and merry they were but how he came by it i know not
this ring was julietta's a fine piece but very good at the sport this diamond was madam acanthe's given him for a song pricked in a private arbour as she said when the queen asked for't and she hard him sing too and danced to his hornpipe or there are liars abroad
there are other toys about you the same way purchased but paralleled with these not worth the relation
you are happy in a husband never man made better use of his strength would you have him waste his body away for nothing
if he holds out there's not an embroidered petticoat in the court but shall be at your service
i commend him it is a thriving trade but pray you leave me a little to myself
you may command your servant madam
she's stung unto the quick lad
i did my part if this potion work not hang me
let her sleep as well as she can to night tomorrow we'll mount new batteries
and till then leave her
exeunt ubaldo and ricardo
you powers that take into your care the guard of innocence aid me
for i am a creature so forfeited to despair hope cannot fancy a ransom to redeem me
i begin to waver in my faith and make it doubtful whether the saints that were canónized for their holiness of life sinned not in secret since my mathias is fallen from his virtue in such an open fashion
could it be else that such a husband so devoted to me so vowed to temperance for lascivious hire should prostitute himself to common harlots
old and deformed too
was't for this he left me and on a feigned pretence for want of means to give me ornament
− or to bring home diseases to me
suppose these are false and lustful goats if he were true and right why stays he so long from me being made rich and that the only reason why he left me
no he is lost and shall i wear the spoils and salaries of lust
they cleave unto me like nessus' poisoned shirt no in my rage i'll tear them off and from my body wash the venom with my tears
have i no spleen nor anger of a woman
shall he build upon my ruins and i unrevenged deplore his falsehood
no with the same trash for which he had dishonoured me i'll purchase a just revenge i am not yet so much in debt to years nor so mis shaped that all should fly from my embraces chastity thou only art a name and i renounce thee
i am now a servant to voluptuousness
wantons of all degrees and fashions welcome
you shall be entertained and if i stray let him condemn himself that led the way
a room in the palace
enter mathias and baptista
we are in a desperate strait there's no evasion nor hope left to come off but by your yielding to the necessity you must feign a grant to her violent passion or − math
we are but dead else
were the sword now heaved up and my neck upon the block i would not buy an hour's reprieve with the loss of faith and virtue to be made immortal here
art thou a scholar nay almost without parallel and yet fear to die which is inevitable
you may urge the many years that by the course of nature we may travel in this tedious pilgrimage and hold it as a blessing as it is when innocence is our guide yet know baptista our virtues are preferred before our years by the great judge to die untainted in our fame and reputation is the greatest and to lose that can we desire to live
or shall i for a momentary pleasure which soon comes to a period to all times have breach of faith and perjury remembered in a still living epitaph
no baptista since my sophia will go to her grave unspotted in her faith i'll follow her with equal loyalty − takes out the picture
but look on this your own great work your masterpiece and then she being still the same teach me to alter
sure i do not sleep
or if i dream this is a terrible vision
i will clear my eyesight perhaps melancholy makes me see that which is not
it is too apparent
i grieve to look upon't besides the yellow that does assure she's tempted there are lines of a dark colour that disperse themselves o'er every miniature of her face and those confirm − math
she is turned whore
i must not say so
yet as a friend to truth if you will have me interpret it in her consent and wishes she's false but not in fact yet
make not yourself a pander to her looseness in labouring to palliate what a visor of impudence cannot cover
did e'er woman in her will decline from chastity but found means to give her hot lust fuël
it is more impossible in nature for gross bodies descending of themselves to hang in the air or with my single arm to underprop a falling tower nay in its violent course to stop the lightning than to stay a woman hurried by two furies lust and falsehood in her full career to wickedness
pray you temper the violence of your passion
in extremes of this condition can it be in man to use a moderation
i am thrown from a steep rock headlong into a gulf of misery and find myself past hope in the same moment that i apprehend that i am falling and this the figure of my idol few hours since while she continued in her perfection that was late a mirror in which i saw miraculous shapes of duty staid manners with all excellency a husband could wish in a chaste wife is on the sudden turned to a magical glass and does present nothing but horns and horror
you may yet and 'tis the best foundation build up comfort on your own goodness
no that hath undone me for now i hold my temperance a sin worse than excess and what was vice a virtue
have i refused a queen and such a queen whose ravishing beauties at the first sight had tempted a hermit from his beads and changed his prayers to amorous sonnets to preserve my faith inviolate to thee with the hazard of my death with torture since she could inflict no less for my contempt and have i met such a return from thee
i will not curse thee nor for thy falsehood rail against the sex tis poor and common i'll only with wise men whisper unto myself howe'er they seem nor present nor past times nor the age to come hath heretofore can now or ever shall produce one constant woman
this is more than the satirists wrote against them
there's no language that can express the poison of these aspics these weeping crocodiles and all too little that hath been said against them
but i'll mould my thoughts into another form and if she can outlive the report of what i have done this hand when next she comes within my reach shall be her executioner
enter honoria and acanthe
wait our command at distance − exit acanthe
− sir you too have free liberty to depart
i know my manners and thank you for the favour
have you taken good rest in your new lodgings
i expect now your resolute answer but advise maturely before i hear it
let my actions madam for no words can dilate my joy in all you can command with cheerfulness to serve you assure your highness and in sign of my submission and contrition for my error my lips that but the last night shunned the touch of yours as poison taught humility now thus on your foot and that too great an honour for such an undeserver seal my duty
a cloudy mist of ignorance equal to cimmerian darkness would not let me see then what now with adoratiön and wonder with reverence i look up to but those fogs dispersed and scattered by the powerful beams with which yourself the sun of all perfection vouchsafe to cure my blindness like a suppliant as low as i can kneel i humbly beg what you once pleased to tender
aside this is more than i could hope
− what find you so attractive upon my face in so short time to make this sudden metamorphosis
pray you rise i for your late neglect thus sign your pardon
ay now you kiss like a lover and not as brothers coldly salute their sisters
i am turned all spirit and fire
yet to give some allay to this hot fervour 'twere good to remember the king whose eyes and ears are everywhere with the danger too that follows this discovered
a bugbear madam let me ride once like phaeton in the chariot of your favour and i contemn jove's thunder though the king in our embraces stood a looker on his hangman and with studied cruelty ready to drag me from your arms it should not fright me from the enjoying that a single life is too poor a price for
o that now all vigour of my youth were re collected for an hour that my desire might meet with yours and draw the envy of all men in the encounter upon my head
i should − but we lose time be gracious mighty queen
pause yet a little the bounties of the king and what weighs more your boasted constancy to your matchless wife should not so soon be shaken
the whole fabric when i but look on you is in a moment o'erturned and ruined and as rivers lose their names when they are swallowed by the ocean in you alone all faculties of my soul are wholly taken up my wife and king at the best as things forgotten
aside can this be
i have gained my end now
wherefore stay you madam
in my consideration what a nothing man's constancy is
your beauties make it so in me sweet lady
and it is my glory i could be coy now as you were but i am of a gentler temper howsoever and in a just return of what i have suffered in your disdain with the same measure grant me equal deliberation i ere long will visit you again and when i next appear as conquered by it slave like wait on my triumphant beauty
what a change is here beyond my fear
but by thy falsehood sophia not her beauty is't denied me to sin but in my wishes
what a frown in scorn at her departure she threw on me
i am both ways lost storms of contempt and scorn are ready to break on me and all hope of shelter doubtful i can neither be disloyal nor yet honest i stand guilty on either part at the worst death will end all and he must be my judge to right my wrong since i have loved too much and lived too long
a room in mathias' house
enter sophia with a book and a note
nor custom nor example nor vast numbers of such as do offend make less the sin
for each particular crime a strict account will be exacted and that comfort which the damned pretend fellows in misery takes nothing from their torments every one must suffer in himself the measure of his wickedness
if so as i must grant it being unrefutable in reason howe'er my lord offend it is no warrant for me to walk in his forbidden paths what penance then can expiate my guilt for my consent transported then with passion to wantonness
the wounds i give my fame cannot recover his and though i have fed these courtiers with promises and hopes i am yet in fact untainted and i trust my sorrow for it with my purity and love to goodness for itself made powerful though all they have alleged prove true or false will be such exorcisms as shall command this fury jealousy from me
what i have determined touching them i am resolved to put in execution
enter hilario corisca with other servants
where are my noble guests
the elder madam is drinking by himself to your ladyship's health in muskadine and eggs and for a rasher to draw his liquor down he hath got a pie of marrowbones potatoes and eringos with many such ingredients and 'tis said he hath sent his man in post to the next town for a pound of ambergris and half a peck of fishes called cantharides
the younger prunes up himself as if this night he were to act a bridegroom's part but to what purpose i am ignorance itself
gives the servants the note
let those lodgings be prepared as this directs you and fail not in a circumstance as you respect my favour
we have our instructions
and punctually will follow them
here comes madam the lord ubaldo
to corisca pretty one there's gold to buy thee a new gown to hilario and there's for thee grow fat and fit for service
− i am now as i should be at the height and able to beget a giant
o my better angel
in this you shew your wisdom when you pay the letcher in his own coin shall you sit puling like a patient grizzle and be laughed at
no this is a fair revenge
the sport you promised
could it be done with safety
i warrant you i am sound as a bell a tough old blade and steel to the back as you shall find me in the trial on your anvil
so but how sir shall i satisfy your friend to whom by promise i am equally engaged
i must confess the more the merrier but of all men living take heed of him you may safer run upon the mouth of a cannon when it is unlading and come off colder
is he not wholesome
i'll tell you for your good he is a spittle of diseases and indeed more loathsome and infectiöus the tub is his weekly bath he hath not drank this seven years before he came to your house but compositions of sassafras and guiacum and dry mutton his daily portion name what scratch soever can be got by women and the surgeons will resolve you at this time or at that ricardo had it
bless me from him
'tis a good prayer lady it being a degree unto the pox only to mention him if my tongue burn not hang me when i but name ricardo
sir this caution must be rewarded
aside i hope i have marred his market − but when
why presently follow my woman she knows where to conduct you and will serve to night for a page
let the waistcoat i appointed with the cambric shirt perfumed and the rich cap be brought into his chamber
and a caudle too in the morning
i will fit you
exeunt ubaldo and corisca
so hot on the scent
here comes the other beagle
to hilario take purse and all
if this company would come often i should make a pretty term on't
for your sake i have put him off he only begged a kiss i gave it and so parted
i hope better he did not touch your lips
yes i assure you
there was no danger in it
eat presently these lozenges of forty crowns an ounce or you are undone
what is the virtue of them
they are preservatives against stinking breath rising from rotten lungs
if so your carriage of such dear antidotes in my opinion may render yours suspected
no i use them when i talk with him i should be poisoned else but i'll be free with you he was once a creature it may be of god's making but long since he is turned to a druggist's shop the spring and fall hold all the year with him that he lives he owes to art not nature she has given him o'er
he moves like the fairy king on screws and wheels made by his doctor's recipes and yet still they are out of joint and every day repairing
he has a regiment of whores he keeps at his own charge in a lazar house but the best is there's not a nose among them
he's acquainted with the green water and the spitting pill's familiar to him in a frosty morning you may thrust him in a pottle pot his bones rattle in his skin like beans tossed in a bladder
if he but hear a coach the fomentation the friction with fumigation cannot save him from the chine evil
in a word he is not one disease but all yet being my friend i will forbear his character for i would not wrong him in your opiniön
the best is the virtues you bestow on him to me are mysteries i know not but however i am at your service
− sirrah let it be your care to unclothe the gentleman and with speed delay takes from delight
there's my hat sword cloak a vengeance on these buttons
off with my doublet i dare shew my skin in the touch you will like it better
− prithee cut my codpiece points and for this service when i leave them off they are thine
i'll take your word sir
dear lady stay not long
i may come too soon sir
no no i am ready now
this is the way sir
exeunt hilario and ricardo
i was much to blame to credit their reports touching my lord that so traduce each other and with such virulent malice though i presume they are bad enough but i have studied for them a way for their recovery
a noise of clapping a door ubaldo appears above in his shirt
what dost thou mean wench
why dost thou shut the door upon me
my clothes are ta'en away too
shall i starve here
is this my lodging
i am sure the lady talked of a rich cap a perfumed shirt and a waistcoat but here is nothing but a little fresh straw a petticoat for a coverlet and that torn too and an old woman's biggin for a night cap
re enter corisca below
'slight 'tis a prison or a pigsty
the windows grated with iron
i cannot force them and if i leap down here i break my neck i am betrayed
let me out i am a lord and that's no common title and shall i be used thus
let him rave he's fast i'll parley with him at leisure
ricardo entering with a great noise above as fallen
the other bird's i' the cage too let him flutter
whither am i fallen
who makes that noise there
help me if thou art a friend
i am where i cannot help myself let me see thy face
prithee throw me thy cloak if thou canst to cover me i am almost frozen to death
i have no breeches i am in my shirt as thou art and here's nothing for myself but a clown's cast suit
we are both undone
prithee roar a little − madam
re enter hilario below in ricardo's suit
lady of the house
grooms of the chamber
shall we be murdered
no but soundly punished to your deserts
you are not in earnest madam
judge as you find and feel it and now hear what i irrevocably purpose to you
being received as guests into my house and with all it afforded entertained you have forgot all hospitable duties and with the defamation of my lord wrought on my woman weakness in revenge of his injuries as you fashioned them to me to yield my honour to your lawless lust
mark that poor fellows
and so far you have transgressed against the dignity of men who should bound to it by virtue still defend chaste ladies' honours that it was your trade to make them infamous but you are caught in your own toils like lustful beasts and therefore hope not to find the usage of men from me such mercy you have forfeited and shall suffer like the most slavish women
how will you use us
ease and excess in feeding made you wanton
a pleurisy of ill blood you must let out by labour and spare diet that way got too or perish for hunger
− reach him up that distaff with the flax upon it − though no omphale nor you a second hercules as i take it as you spin well at my command and please me your wages in the coarsest bread and water shall be proportionable
i will starve first
that's as you please
what will become of me now
you shall have gentler work i have oft observed you were proud to shew the fineness of your hands and softness of your fingers you should reel well what he spins if you give your mind to it as i'll force you
− deliver him his materials
− now you know your penance fall to work hunger will teach you and so as slaves to your lust not me i leave you
exeunt sophia and corisca
i shall spin a fine thread out now
i cannot look on these devices but they put me in mind of rope makers
fellow think of thy task
forget such vanities my livery there will serve thee to work in
let me have my clothes yet i was bountiful to thee
they are past your wearing and mine by promise as all these can witness
you have no holidays coming nor will i work while these and this lasts and so when you please you may shut up your shop windows
i am faint and must lie down
i am hungry too and cold
this comes of our whoring
but let us rest as well as we can to night but not o'ersleep ourselves lest we fast tomorrow

enter ladislaus honoria eubulus ferdinand acanthe and attendants
now you know all sir with the motives why i forced him to my lodging
i desire no more such trials lady
i presume sir you do not doubt my chastity
i would not but these are strange inducements
by no means sir
why though he were with violence seized upon and still detained the man sir being no soldier nor used to charge his pike when the breach is open there was no danger in't
you must conceive sir being religious she chose him for a chaplain to read old homilies to her in the dark she's bound to it by her canons
still tormented with thy impertinence
by yourself dear sir i was ambitious only to o'erthrow his boasted constancy in his consent but for fact i contemn him i was never unchaste in thought i laboured to give proof what power dwells in this beauty you admire so and when you see how soon it hath transformed him and with what superstition he adores it determine as you please
i will look on this pageant but − hon
when you have seen and heard sir the passages which i myself discovered and could have kept concealed had i meant basely judge as you please
well i'll observe the issue
how had you ta'en this general in your wife
as a strange curiosity but queens are privileged above subjects and 'tis fit sir
another room in the same
enter mathias and baptista
you are much altered sir since the last night when the queen left you and look cheerfully your dulness quite blown over
i have seen a vision this morning makes it good and never was in such security as at this instant fall what can fall and when the queen appears whose shortest absence now is tedious to me observe the encounter
enter honoria ladislaus eubulus ferdinand and acanthe with others appear above
she already is entered the lists
and i prepared to meet her
i know my duty
not so you may stay now as a witness of our contract
i obey in all things madam
where's that reverence or rather superstitious adoration which captive like to my triumphant beauty you paid last night
no humble knee nor sign of vassal duty
sure this is the foot to whose proud cover and then happy in it your lips were glued and that the neck then offered to witness your subjection to be trod on your certain loss of life in the king's anger was then too mean a price to buy my favour and that false glow worm fire of constancy to your wife extinguished by a greater light shot from our eyes − and that it may be being too glorious to be looked on hath deprived you of speech and motion but i will take off a little from the splendour and descend from my own height and in your lowness hear you plead as a suppliant
i do remember i once saw such a woman
and then she did appear a most magnificent queen and what's more virtuóus though somewhat darkened with pride and self opinion
call you this courtship
and she was happy in a royal husband whom envy could not tax unless it were for his too much indulgence to her humours
pray you sir observe that touch 'tis to the purpose i like the play the better for't
and she lived worthy her birth and fortune you retain yet some part of her angelical form but when envy to the beauty of another woman inferior to hers one that she never had seen but in her picture had dispersed infection through her veins and loyalty which a great queen as she was should have nourished grew odious to her − hon
and lust in all the bravery it could borrow from majesty howe'er disguised had ta'en sure footing in the kingdom of her heart the throne of chastity once how in a moment all that was gracious great and glorious in her and won upon all hearts like seeming shadows wanting true substance vanished
how his reasons work on my soul
retire into yourself your own strengths madam strongly manned with virtue and be but as you were and there's no office so base beneath the slavery that men impose on beasts but i will gladly bow to
but as you play and juggle with a stranger varying your shapes like thetis though the beauties of all that are by poets' raptures sainted were now in you united you should pass pitied by me perhaps but not regarded
if this take not i am cheated
to slip once is incident and excused by human frailty but to fall ever damnable
we were both guilty i grant in tendering our affection but as i hope you will do i repented
when we are grown up to ripeness our life is like to this magic picture
while we run a constant race in goodness it retains the just proportion but the journey being tedious and sweet temptation in the way that may in some degree divert us from the road that we put forth in ere we end our pilgrimage it may like this turn yellow or be with blackness clouded but when we find we have gone astray and labour to return unto our never failing guide virtue contrition with unfeignèd tears the spots of vice washed off will soon restore it to the first pureness
i am disenchanted mercy o mercy heavens
i am ravished with what i have seen and heard
let us descend and hear the rest below
this hath fallen out beyond my expectation
how have i wandered out of the track of piety
and misled by overweening pride and flattery of fawning sycophants the bane of greatness could never meet till now a passenger that in his charity would set me right or stay me in my precipice to ruin
how ill have i returned your goodness to me
the horror in my thought of’t turns me marble but if it may be yet prevented − re enter ladislaus eubulus ferdinand acanthe and others below
o sir what can i do to shew my sorrow or with what brow ask your pardon
never till you forgive me and receive unto your love and favour a changed woman my state and pride turned to humility henceforth shall wait on your commands and my obedience steered only by your will
and that will prove a second and a better marriage to me
sir i must not rise yet till with a free confession of a crime unknown to you yet and a following suit which thus i beg be granted
i melt with you 'tis pardoned and confirmed thus
know then sir in malice to this good knight's wife i practised ubaldo and ricardo to corrupt her
aside thence grew the change of the picture
and how far they have prevailed i am ignorant now if you sir for the honour of this good man may be entreated to travaile thither it being but a day's journey to fetch them off − ladis
we will put on to night
i if you please your harbinger
− let me embrace you in my arms your service done on the turk compared with this weighs nothing
i am still your humble creature
and so you are bound to hold him
such a plant imported to your kingdom and here grafted would yield more fruit than all the idle weeds that suck up your rain of favour
in my will i’ll not be wanting
prepare for our journey

enter sophia corisca and hilario
are they then so humble
hunger and hard labour have tamed them madam at the first they bellowed like stags ta'en in a toil and would not work for sullenness but when they found without it there was no eating and that to starve to death was much against their stomach by degrees against their wills they fell to it
and now feed on the little pittance you allow with gladness
i do remember that they stopped their noses at the sight of beef and mutton as coarse feeding for their fine palates but now their work being ended they leap at a barley crust and hold cheese parings with a spoonful of palled wine poured in their water for festival exceedings
when i examine my spinster's work he trembles like a prentice and takes a box on the ear when i spy faults and botches in his labour as a favour from a curst mistress
the other too reels well for his time and if your ladyship would please to see them for your sport since they want airing it would do well in my judgment you shall hear such a hungry dialogue from them
but suppose when they are out of prison they should grow rebellious
never fear't i'll undertake to lead them out by the nose with a coarse thread of the one's spinning and make the other reel after and without grumbling and when you are weary of their company as easily return them
dear madam it will help to drive away your melancholy
well on this assurance i am content bring them hither
i will do it in stately equipage
they have confessed then they were set on by the queen to taint me in my loyalty to my lord
'twas the main cause that brought them hither
i am glad i know it and as i have begun before i end i'll at the height revenge it let us step aside they come the object's so ridiculous in spite of my sad thoughts i cannot but lend a forced smile to grace it
re enter hilario with ubaldo spinning and ricardo reeling
come away work as you go and lose no time 'tis precious you'll find it in your commons
commons call you it
the word is proper i have grazed so long upon your commons i am almost starved here
work harder and they shall be bettered
worser they cannot be would i might lie like a dog under her table and serve for a footstool so i might have my belly full of that her iceland cur refuses
how do you like your airing
is it not a favour
yes just such a one as you use to a brace of greyhounds when they are led out of their kennels to scumber but our case is ten times harder we have nothing in our bellies to be vented if you will be an honest yeoman fewterer feed us first and walk us after
such another word to your governor and you go supperless to bed for't

i am so dry i have not spittle enough to wet my fingers when i draw my flax from my distaff

what do you think were best to apply to it
a cramp stone as i take it were very useful
no more of stones we have been used too long like hawks already
we are not so high in our flesh now to need casting we will come to an empty fist
nay that you shall not

how do your scholars profit
hold up your heads demurely
prettily for young beginners

a poor cobbler's wife would make a finer to sew a clown's rent startup and here you reel as you were drunk
i am sure it is not with wine
o take heed of wine cold water is far better for your healths of which i am very tender you had foul bodies and must continue in this physical diet till the cause of your disease be ta'en away for fear of a relapse and that is dangerous yet i hope already that you are in some degree recovered and that way to resolve me answer me truly nay what i propound concerns both nearer what would you now give if your means were in your hands to lie all night with a fresh and handsome lady
o i am past it hunger with her razor hath made me an eunuch

excuse me at his earnest suit i did it
very good − was i grown so cheap in his opinion of me
the prosperous events that crown his fortunes may qualify the offence
good the events − the sanctuary fools and madmen fly to when their rash and desperate undertakings thrive well but good and wise men are directed by grave counsels and with such deliberation proceed in their affairs that chance has nothing to do with them howsoe'er take the pains sir to meet the honour in the king and queen's approaches to my house that breaks upon me i will expect them with my best of care
to entertain such royal guests − soph
i know it leave that to me sir
what should move the queen so given to ease and pleasure as fame speaks her to such a journey
or work on my lord to doubt my loyalty nay more to take for the resolution of his fears a course that is by holy writ denied a christian

sure my family's drunk or by some witch in envy of my glory a dead sleep thrown upon them
enter hilario and servants
but that the sacred presence of the king forbids it my sword should make a massacre among you
where is your mistress
first you are welcome home sir then know she says she's sick sir
− aside there's no notice taken of my bravery
sick at such a time
it cannot be though she were on her death bed and her spirit e'en now departed here stand they could call it back again and in this honour give her a second being
bring me to her i know not what to urge or how to redeem this mortgage of her manners
exeunt mathias hilario and servants
there's no climate on the world i think where one jade's trick or other reigns not in women
you were ever bitter against the sex
this is very strange
mean women have their faults as well as queens
o she appears now
re enter mathias with sophia hilario following
the injury that you conceive i have done you dispute hereafter and in your perverseness wrong not yourself and me
i am past my childhood and need no tutor
this is the great king to whom i am engaged till death for all i stand possessed of
my humble roof is proud sir to be the canopy of so much greatness set off with goodness
my own praises flying in such pure air as your sweet breath fair lady cannot but please me
this is the queen of queens in her magnificence to me
in my duty i kiss her highness' robe
you stoop too low to her whose lips would meet with yours
howe'er it may appear preposterous in women so to encounter 'tis your pleasure madam and not my proud ambition
– aside to mathias do you hear sir
without a magical picture in the touch i find your print of close and wanton kisses on the queen's lips
upon your life be silent and now salute these lords
since you will have me you shall see i am experienced at the game and can play it tightly
to ferdinand you are a brave man sir and do deserve a free and hearty welcome be this the prologue to it
an old man's turn is ever last in kissing
− i have lips too however cold ones madam
i will warm them with the fire of mine
and so she has
i thank you i shall sleep the better all night for't
aside to sophia you express the boldness of a wanton courtezan and not a matron's modesty take up or you are disgraced for ever
with kissing feelingly as you taught me
would you have me turn my cheek to them as proud ladies use to their inferiors as if they intended some business should be whispered in their ear and not a salutation
what i do i will do freely now i am in the humour i'll fly at all are there any more
forbear or you will raise my anger to a height that will descend in fury
you know how to resolve yourself what my intents are by the help of mephostophilus and your picture pray you look upon't again
i humbly thank the queen's great care of me while you were absent
she knew how tedious 'twas for a young wife and being for that time a kind of widow to pass away her melancholy hours without good company and in charity therefore provided for me out of her own store she culled the lords ubaldo and ricardo two principal courtiers for ladies' service to do me all good offices and as such employed by her i hope i have received and entertained them nor shall they depart without the effect arising from the cause that brought them hither
thou dost belie thyself i know that in my absence thou wert honest however now turned monster
the truth is we did not deal like you in speculations on cheating pictures we knew shadows were no substances and actual performance the best assurance
i will bring them hither to make good in this presence so much for me
some minutes space i beg your majesties' pardon
− you are moved now champ upon this bit a little anon you shall have another
− wait me hilario
exeunt sophia and hilario
fly and fly quickly from this cursed habitation or this gorgon will make you all as i am
in her tongue millions of adders hiss and every hair upon her wicked head a snake more dreadful than that tisiphone threw on athamas which in his madness forced him to dismember his proper issue
o that ever i reposed my trust in magic or believed impossibilities
or that charms had power to sink and search into the bottomless hell of a false woman's heart
these are the fruits of marriage
an old bachelor as i am and what's more will continue so is not troubled with these fine fagaries
till you are resolved sir forsake not hope
upon my life this is dissimulation
and it suits not with your fortitude and wisdom to be thus transported with your passion
you were once deceived in me sir as i was in you yet the deceit pleased both
she hath confessed all what further proof should i ask
yet remember the distance that is interposed between a woman's tongue and her heart and you must grant you build upon no certainties
re enter sophia corisca and hilario with ubaldo and ricardo in rags spinning and reeling as before
what have we here
you must come on and shew yourselves
would i were as far under the earth as i am above it
some poet will from this relation or in verse or prose or both together blended render us ridiculous to all ages
i remember this face when it was in a better plight are not you ricardo
and this thing i take it was once ubaldo
i am now i know not what
we thank your majesty for employing us to this subtle circe
do you work by the day or by the great
is your theorbo turned to a distaff signior
and your voice with which you chanted room for a lusty gallant
tuned to the note of lachrymae
prithee tell me for i know thou'rt free how oft and to the purpose you've been merry with this lady
howsoever you should say so for your credit being the only court bull
o that ever i saw this kicking heifer
you see madam how i have cured your servants and what favours they with their rampant valour have won from me
you may as they are physic’d i presume trust a fair virgin with them they have learned their several trades to live by and paid nothing but cold and hunger for them and may now set up for themselves for here i give them over
− and now to you sir why do you not again peruse your picture and take the advice of your learnèd consort
these are the men or none that made you as the italian says a becco
i know not which way to entreat your pardon nor am i worthy of it
my sophia my best sophia here before the king the queen these lords and all the lookers on i do renounce my error and embrace you as the great example to all aftertimes for such as would die chaste and noble wives with reverence to imitate
not so sir i yet hold off
however i have purged my doubted innocence the foul aspersions in your unmanly doubts cast on my honour cannot so soon be washed off
shall we have more jiggobobs yet
when you went to the wars i set no spy upon you to observe which way you wandered though our sex by nature is subject to suspiciöns and fears my confidence in your loyalty freed me from them
but to deal as you did 'gainst your religion with this enchanter to survey my actions was more than woman's weakness therefore know and 'tis my boon unto the king i do desire a separation from your bed for i will spend the remnant of my life in prayer and meditation
o take pity upon my weak condition or i am more wretched in your innocence than if i had found you guilty
have you shown a jewel out of the cabinet of your rich mind to lock it up again
− she turns away
will none speak for me
shame and sin hath robbed me of the use of my tongue
since you have conquered madam you wrong the glory of your victory if you use it not with mercy
any penance you please to impose upon him i dare warrant he will gladly suffer
have i lived to see but one good woman and shall we for a trifle have her turn nun
i will first pull down the cloister
to the old sport again with a good luck to you
‘tis not alone enough that you are good we must have some of the breed of you will you destroy the kind and race of goodness
i am converted and ask your pardon madam for my ill opinion against the sex and shew me but two such more i'll marry yet and love them
she that yet ne'er knew what 'twas to bend but to the king thus begs remission for him
o dear madam wrong not your greatness so
we are all suitors
i do deserve to be hard among the rest
and we have suffered for it
i perceive there's no resistance but suppose i pardon what's past who can secure me he'll be free from jealousy hereafter
i will be my own security go ride where you please feast revel banquet and make choice with whom i'll set no watch upon you and for proof of it this cursèd picture i surrender up to a consuming fire
as i abjure the practice of my art
upon these terms i am reconciled and for these that have paid the price of their folly i desire your mercy
at your request they have it
hang all trades now
i will find a new one and that is to live honest
these are my fees
pray you take them with a mischief
so all ends in peace now
and to all married men be this a caution which they should duly tender as their life neither to dote too much nor doubt a wife
