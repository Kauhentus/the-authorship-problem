enter two moors taking tobacco music sounding within
enter with two sitting on a chair suddenly draws the curtain
on me does music spend this sound
on me that hate all unity
are you there with your beagles
did not i bind you on your lives to watch that none disturb'd us
there off is't you that deaf me with this noise
why is my love's aspa"ct so grim and horrid
look smoothly on me chime out your softest strains of harmony and on delicious music's silken wings send ravishing delight to my love's ears that he may be enamoured of your tunes
no no says ay and twice away says stay come come i'll have a kiss but if you strive for one denial you shall forfeit five
nay prythee good queen leave me i am now sick and heavy dull as lead
i'll make thee lighter by taking something from thee
do take from me this ague and these fits that hanging on me shake me in pieces and set all my blood a boiling with the fire of rage away away
thou believ'st i jest and laugh'st to see my wrath wear antic shapes
what means my love
burst all those wires burn all those instruments for they displease my moor
art thou now pleas'd
or wert thou now disturb'd
i'll wage all spain to one sweet kiss this is some new device to make me fond and long
o you men have tricks to make poor women die for you
what die for me
i prythee speak more kindly why dost thou frown
o why at me
for each contracted frown a crooked wrinkle interlines my brow spend but one hour in frowns and i shall look like to a beldame of one hundred years
i prythee speak to me and chide me not
i prythee chide if i have done amiss but let my punishment be this and this
i prythee smile on me if but awhile then frown on me i'll die i prythee smile
smile on me and these two wanton boys these pretty lads that do attend on me shall call thee jove shall wait upon thy cup and fill thee nectar their enticing eyes shall serve as crystal wherein thou may'st see to dress thyself if thou wilt smile on me
smile on me and with coronets of pearl and bells of gold circling their pretty arms in a round ivory fount these two shall swim and dive to make thee sport bestow one smile one little little smile and in a net of twisted silk and gold in my all naked arms thyself shall lie
why what to do
lust's arms do stretch so wide that none can fill them
where hast thou learn'd this language that can say no more but two rude words away away
am i grown ugly now
thou lov'dst me once
that can thy bastards tell
what is my sin
i will amend the same
use of sin makes thee past shame
too true 'tis woe is me i am a strumpet but made so by thee
no no by these young bawds fetch thee a glass and thou shalt see the balls of both thine eyes burning in fire of lust
there's here within this hollow cistern of thy breast a spring of hot blood have not i to cool it made an extraction to the quintessence even of my soul melted all my spirits ravish'd my youth deflow'r'd my lovely cheeks and dried this this to an anatomy only to feed your lust
these boys have ears in a whisper
yet wouldst thou murder me
i cannot ride through the castilian streets but thousand eyes through windows and through doors throw killing looks at me and every slave at eleazar darts a finger out and every hissing tongue cries "there's the moor that's he that makes a cuckold of our king there goes the minion of the spanish queen that's the black prince of devils there goes he that on smooth boys on masques and revellings spends the revenues of the king of spain
" who arms this many headed beast but you
murder and lust are twins and both are thine
being weary of me thou wouldst worry me because some new love makes thee loathe thine old
harlot i'll not hear thee speak
i'll kill myself unless thou hear'st me speak
my husband king upon his deathbed lies yet have i stol'n from him to look on thee a queen hath made herself thy concubine yet dost thou now abhor me hear me speak else shall my sons plague thy adult'rous wrongs and tread upon thy heart for murdering me this tongue hath murder'd me
dear love look up our chamber window stares into the court and every wide mouth'd ear hearing this news will give alarum to the cuckold king i did dissemble when i chid my love and that dissembling was to try my love
thou call'dst me strumpet
i'll tear out my tongue from this black temple for blaspheming thee
and when i woo'd thee but to smile on me thou cri'dst away away and frown'dst upon me
come now i will kiss thee now i'll smile upon thee call to thy ashy cheeks their wonted red come frown not pout not smile smile upon me and with my poniard will i stab my flesh and quaff carouses to thee of my blood whilst in moist nectar kisses thou dost pledge me
how now why star'st thou thus
enter the king is dead
is't true is't true
the king is dead
who dare knock thus
it is the cardinal making inquiry if the queen were here
see she is here go tell him and yet no zarack stay
enter don roderigo's come to seek the queen
why should roderigo seek her here
the king hath swooned thrice and being recovered sends up and down the court to seek her grace
the king was dead with you
to run and with a voice erected high as mine say thus thus threaten to roderigo and the cardinal seek no queens here i'll broach them if they do upon my falchion's point knock again
your father is at hand my gracious lord
lock all the chambers bar him out you apes hither a vengeance
stir eugenia you know your old walk underground away
so down hie to the king quick quick you squalls crawl with your dam i' th' dark dear love farewell one day i hope to shut you up in hell
enter son eleazar saw you not the queen
was not the queen here with you
because my lord i'm married to your daughter you like your daughter will grow jealous the queen with me
with me a moor a devil a slave of barbary a dog for so your silken courtiers christen me
but father although my flesh be tawny in my veins runs blood as red as royal as the best and proudest in spain there does old man
my father who with his empire lost his life and left me captive to a spanish tyrant go tell him spanish tyrant tell him do
he that can lose a kingdom and not rave he's a tame jade i am not tell old philip i call him tyrant here's a sword and arms a heart a head and so pish
old fellow she's not here but ere i die sword i'll bequeath thee a rich legacy
watch fitter hours to think on wrongs than now death's frozen hand holds royal philip's heart half of his body lies within a grave then do not now by quarrels shake that state which is already too much ruinate
come and take leave of him before he die
now purple villany sit like a robe imperial on my back that under thee i closelier may contrive my vengeance foul deeds hid do sweetly thrive
mischief erect thy throne and sit in state here here upon this head let fools fear fate thus i defy my stars
i care not i how low i tumble down so i mount high old time i'll wait bareheaded at thy heels and be a footboy to thy winged hours they shall not tell one minute out in sands but i'll set down the number i'll still wake and waste these balls of sight by tossing them in busy observations upon thee
i'll bind myself to thee in base apprenticehood so long till on thy naked scalp grow hair as thick as mine and all hands shall lay hold on thee if thou wilt lend me but thy rusty scythe to cut down all that stand within my wrongs and my revenge
love dance in twenty forms upon my beauty that this spanish dame may be bewitch'd and doat her amorous flames shall blow up the old king consume his sons and make all spain a bonfire
this tragedy being acted hers doth begin to shed a harlot's blood can be no sin
the curtain being drawn there appears in his bed with his lords the at the feet and to them enter in haste
whose was that screech owl's voice that like the sound of a hell tortur'd soul rung through mine ears nothing but horrid shrieks nothing but death
whilst i vailing my knees to the cold earth drowning my wither'd cheeks in my warm tears and stretching out my arms to pull from heaven health for the royal majesty of spain all cried the majesty of spain is dead
that last word dead struck through the echoing air rebounded on my heart and smote me down breathless to the cold earth and made me leave my prayers for philip's life but thanks to heaven i see him live and lives i hope to see unnumber'd years to guide this empery
the number of my years ends in one day ere this sun's down all a king's glory sets for all our lives are but death counterfeits
father mendoza and you peers of spain dry your wet eyes for sorrow wanteth force inspire a breathing soul in a dead corse such is your king
where's isabella our daughter
at your bed's feet confounded in her tears
she of your grief the heaviest burthen bears you can but lose a king but she a father
she bear the heaviest burthen
o say rather i bear and am borne down my sorrowing is for a husband's loss loss of a king
alvero call the princess hither
madam his majesty doth call for you
come hither isabella reach a hand yet now it shall not need instead of thine death shoving thee back clasps his hands in mine and bids me come away i must i must though kings be gods on earth they turn to dust
is not prince philip come from portugal
the prince as yet is not return'd my lord
commend me to him if i ne'er behold him
this tells the order of my funeral do it as 'tis set down embalm my body though worms do make no difference of flesh yet kings are curious here to dig their graves such is man's frailty when i am embalm'd apparel me in a rich royal robe according to the custom of the land then place my bones within that brazen shrine which death hath builded for my ancestors i cannot name death but he straight steps in and pulls me by the arm
his grace doth faint help me my lords softly to raise him up
enter and stands sadly by
lift me not up i shortly must go down
when a few dribbling minutes have run out mine hour is ended
king of spain farewell you all acknowledge him your sovereign
when you are dead we will acknowledge him
govern this kingdom well to be a king is given to many but to govern well granted to few
have care to isabel her virtue was king philip's looking glass reverence the queen your mother love your sister and the young prince your brother even that day when spain shall solemnise my obsequies and lay me up in earth let them crown you
where's eleazar don alvero's son
yonder with cross'd arms stands he malcontent
i do commend him to thee for a man both wise and warlike yet beware of him ambition wings his spirit keep him down
what will not men attempt to win a crown
mendoza is protector of thy realm i did elect him for his gravity i trust he'll be a father to thy youth
call help fernando now i faint indeed
let none with a distracted voice shriek out and trouble me in my departure
heaven's hands i see are beckoning for my soul i come i come thus do the proudest die death hath no mercy life no certainty
as yet his soul's not from her temple gone therefore forbear loud lamentation
o he's dead he's dead
lament and die in her king's end begins spain's misery
he shall not end so soon
forbear sweet isabella shrieks are vain
you cry forbear you by his loss of breath have won a kingdom you may cry forbear but i have lost a father and a king and no tongue shall control my sorrowing
i will go where i will languish in eternal woe
talk not of love to me the world and the world's pride henceforth i'll scorn
my love shall follow thee if thou deny'st to live with poor hortenzo as his wife i'll never change my love but change my life
i know he is not dead i know proud death durst not behold such sacred majesty
why stand you thus distracted
mother brother my lord mendoza where's my royal father
here lies the temple of his royal soul
here's all that's left of philip's majesty wash you his tomb with tears fernando's moan hating a partner shall be spent alone
philip is gone to joy philip's forlorn he dies to live my life with woe is torn
sweet mother o how i now do shame to lay on one so foul so fair a name had you been a true mother a true wife this king had not so soon been robb'd of life
what means this rage my son
call not me your son
my father whil'st he liv'd tir'd his strong arms in bearing christian armour 'gainst the turks and spent his brains in warlike stratagems to bring confusion on damn'd infidels whilst you that snorted here at home betray'd his name to everlasting infamy whilst you at home suffer'd his bedchamber to be a brothelry whilst you at home suffer'd his queen to be a concubine and wanton red cheek'd boys to be her bawds whilst she reeking in that lecher's arms me
villain 'tis thee thou hell begotten fiend at thee i stare
philip thou art a villain to dishonour me
mother i am no villain 'tis this villain dishonours you and me dishonours spain dishonours all these lords this devil is he that what
o pardon me i must throw off all chains of duty wert thou ten kings' sons had i as many souls as i have sins as this from hence so they from this should fly in just revenge of this indignity
give way or i'll make way upon your bosoms
did my dear sovereign live sirrah that tongue did but king philip live traitor i'd tell a tale that should rid both your souls to hell
tell philip's ghost that philip tells his queen that philip's queen is a moor's concubine did the king live i'd tell him how you two ripp'd up the entrails of his treasury with masques and antic revellings
dost hear me boy
stand you all still and see me thus trod down
stand you all still yet let this devil stand here
eleazar i am now protector to fernando king of spain by that authority and by consent of all these peers i utterly deprive thee of all those royalties thou holdst in spain
cardinal who lends thee this commission
cardinal i'll shorten thee by the head for this
forward my lord mendoza damn the fiend
princes of spain consent you to this pride
let his faith be tried
his treasons need no trial they're too plain
come not within the court for if you do to beg with indian slaves i'll banish you
exeunt all but and why should my son be banished
enter of that dispute not now
alvero i'll to the king my son it shall be tried if castile's king can cool a cardinal's pride
exeunt and if i digest this gall o my maria i am whipp'd and rack'd and torn upon the wheel of giddy fortune she and her minions have got me down and treading on my bosom they cry lie still the cardinal o rare
would bandy me away from spain and banish me to beg ay beg with slaves
conquer with patience these indignities
yes yes an honest cardinal
yet smother still the grief and seek revenge
s'foot why say they do there's portugal a good air and france a fine country or barbary rich and has moors the turk pure devil and allows enough to fat the sides of villany good living there
i can live there and there and there troth 'tis a villain can live anywhere
but say i go from hence i leave behind me a cardinal that will laugh i leave behind me a philip that will clap his hands for joy
and dance lavoltoes through the castile court but the deep'st wound of all is this i leave my wrongs dishonours and my discontents o unreveng'd my bedrid enemies shall never be rais'd up by the strong physical curing of my sword therefore stay still many have hearts to strike that dare not kill leave me maria
cardinal this disgrace shall dye thy soul as inky as my face
enter to the king i'll fly he shall revenge my lord's indignity
mendoza woos the king to banish thee
startle thy wonted spirits awake thy soul and on thy resolution fasten wings whose golden feathers may outstrip their hate
i'll tie no golden feathers to my wings
shall they thus tread thee down which once were glad to lacquey by thy conquering chariot wheels
i care not i can swallow more sour wrongs
if they triumph o'er thee they'll spurn me down
what ice hath cool'd that fire which sometimes made thy thoughts to heaven aspire
this patience had not wont to dwell with thee
enter and 'tis right but now the world is chang'd you see though i seem dead to you here lives a fire no more here comes the king and my maria the spaniard loves my wife she swears to me she's chaste as the white moon well if she be well too if she be not i care not i i'll climb up by that love to dignity
thou woo'st me to revenge thy husband's wrong i woo thy fair self not to wrong thyself swear but to love me and to thee i'll swear to crown thy husband with a diadem
such love as i dare yield i'll not deny
when in the golden arms of majesty i am broke off yonder thy husband stands i'll set him free if thou unite my bands so much for that
durst then the cardinal put on such insolence
tell me fair madam where's your most valiant husband
he sees me and yet inquires for me
eleazar i have in my breast writ down from her report your late receiv'd disgrace my father lov'd you dearly so will true for my wife's sake
this indignity will i have interest in for being your king you shall perceive i'll curb my underling
this morning is our coronation and our father's funeral solemnised
be present step into your wonted place we'll gild your dim disgraces with our grace
i thank my sovereign that you love my wife i thank thee wife that thou wilt lock my head in such strong armour to bear off all blows who dare say such wives are their husbands' foes
let's see now by her falling i must rise cardinal you die if the king bid me live philip you die for railing at me proud lord you die that with mendoza cried banish the moor
and you my loving liege you're best sit fast if all these live not you must die at last
enter two with him the crowned and attendants
why stares this devil thus as if pale death had made his eyes the dreadful messengers to carry black destruction to the world
was he not banish'd spain
your sacred mouth pronounc'd the sentence of his banishment then spurn the villain forth
who spurns the moor were better set his foot upon the devil
do spurn me and this confounding arm of wrath shall like a thunderbolt breaking the clouds divide his body from his soul
shall we bear this pride
he underwent much injury
what injury have we perform'd proud lord
proud cardinal my unjust banishment
'twas we that did it and our words are laws
'twas we repeal'd him and our words are laws
if not these are
all the moors draw
shall we give arm to hostile violence
sheathe your swords sheathe them it's we command
grant eleazar justice my dread liege
eleazar hath had justice from our hands and he stands banish'd from the court of spain
have you done justice
why lord cardinal from whom do you derive authority to banish him the court without our leave
from this the staff of our protectorship from this which the last will of your dead father committed to our trust from this high place which lifts mendoza's spirits beyond the pitch of ordinary honour and from this takes the staff from and gives it to which too much overweening insolence hath quite ta'en from thee
eleazar up and from us sway this staff of regency
dare sons presume to break their father's will
dare subjects countercheck their sovereign's will
'tis done and who gainsays it is a traitor
i do fernando yet am i no traitor
fernando i am wrong'd by peter's chair mendoza vows revenge
i'll lay aside my cardinal's hat and in a wall of steel the glorious livery of a soldier fight for my late lost honour
thou shalt be no king for wronging me
the pope shall send his bulls through all thy realm and pull obedience from thy subjects' hearts to put on armour of the mother church
curses shall fall like lightnings on thy head bell book and candle holy water prayers shall all chime vengeance to the court of spain till they have power to conjure down that fiend that damn'd moor that devil that lucifer that dares aspire the staff the card'nal sway'd
i laugh yet that the cardinal's vex'd
laugh'st thou base slave
the wrinkles of that scorn thine own heart's blood shall fill
brother farewell since you disprove the will our father left for base lust of a loathed concubine
who does prince philip mean
base aspiring lords who to buy honour are content to sell your names to infamy your souls to hell
and stamp you now
do do for you shall see i go for vengeance and she'll come with me
stay for she's here already see proud boy
stay this fury if you long for blood murder me first
dear son you are a king then stay the violent tempest of their wrath
shall kings be oversway'd in their desires
shall subjects be oppress'd by tyranny
no state shall suffer wrong then hear me speak mendoza you have sworn you love the queen then by that love i charge you leave these arms
eleazar for those favours i have given you embrace the cardinal and be friends with him
and have my wife call'd strumpet to my face
'twas rage made his tongue err do you not know the violent love mendoza bears the queen
then speak him fair for in that honey'd breath i'll lay a bait shall train him to his death
come come i see your looks give way to peace lord cardinal begin and aside for reward ere this fair setting sun behold his bride be bold to challenge love yet be denied
that promise makes me yield
my gracious lord though my disgrace hath graven its memory on every spaniard's eye yet shall the duty i owe your sacred highness and the love my country challengeth make me lay by hostile intendments and return again to the fair circle of obedience
both pardon and our favour bids you welcome and for some satisfaction for your wrongs we here create you salamanca's duke but first as a true sign all grudges die shake hands with eleazar and be friends this union pleaseth us
now brother philip you are included in this league of love so is roderigo
to forget all wrongs your castle for awhile shall bid us welcome eleazar shall it not
lords lead the way that aside whilst you feast yourselves fernando may find time all means to prove to compass fair maria for our love
and madam a word now have you wit or spirit
set them both to a most gainful task
our enemies are in my castle work
ay but the king's there too it's dangerous pride to strike at those that crouch by a lion's side
a thousand ways by poison or by this points to his sword but every groom has skill in such base traffic no our policies must look more strange must fly with loftier wings vengeance the higher it falls more honour brings but you are cold you dare not do
you have a woman's heart look you this hand takes her hand
o 'tis too little to strike home
angels of heaven stand like his guard about him
not for so many worlds as there be stars sticking upon th' embroider'd firmament
he loves my wife and should he die i know none else would love her let him live in heaven
good lord philip he shall die
this night if eleazar give consent
why then this night philip shall not live to see you kill him
is he not your son
a mother be the murd'rer of a brat that liv'd within her
'tis for thy sake
what excuses cannot damn'd sin make to save itself
i know you love him well but that he has an eye an eye an eye
to others our two hearts seem to be lock'd up in a case of steel upon our love others dare not look or if they dare they cast squint purblind glances
who care though all see all so long as none dare speak
but philip knows that iron ribs of our villains are thin he laughs to see them like this hand with chinks and crevices how with a villanous a stabbing a desperate tongue the boy dare speak a mouth a villanous mouth
thus go you and with a face well set do in good sad colours such as paint out the cheek of that foul penitence and with a tongue made clean and glib cull from their lazy swarm some honest friars whom that damnation gold can tempt to lay their souls to the stake seek such they are rank and thick
i know such what's the use
hire these to write books preach and proclaim abroad that your son philip is a bastard
do you know a bastard
do't say conscience spake with you and cried out do't by this means shall you thrust him from all hope of wearing castile's diadem and that spur galling his sides he will fly out and fling and grind the cardinal's heart to a new edge of discontent from discontent grows treason and on the stalk of treason death he's dead by this blow and by you yet no blood shed
do't then by this trick he is gone
we stand more sure in climbing high care not who fall 'tis real policy are you arm'd to do this ha
sweet moor it is done
away then work with boldness and with speed on greatest actions greatest dangers feed
i thank thee provident creation that seeing in moulding me thou didst intend i should prove villain thanks to thee and nature that skilful workman thanks for my face thanks that i have not wit to blush
enter the two my lord
hang both your greedy ears upon my lips let them devour my speech suck in my breath and in
who let's it break prison here is his death
this night the card'nal shall be murder'd
and to fill up a grave philip dies
by thee and slave by thee
have you the hearts and hands to execute
he dies were he my father
stay go go stay see me no more till night
your cheeks are black let not your souls look white
till night a word
the mother queen is trying if she can with fire of gold warp the green consciences of two covetous friars to preach abroad philip's bastardy
who was his father
search for these friars hire them to work with you
their holy callings will approve the fact most good and meritorious sin shines clear when her black face religion's mask doth wear
here comes the queen good and the friars
enter two friars and and your son a bastard
say we do but how then shall we deal with you
i tell you as i said before his being a bastard you are so poor in honour and in name that time can never take away the crime
i grant that friar yet rather i'll endure the wound of infamy to kill my name than to see spain bleeding with civil swords
the boy is proud ambitious he woos greatness he takes up spanish hearts on trust to pay them when he shall finger castile's crown
o then were it not better my disgrace were known than such a base aspirer fill the throne
ha brother crab what think you
as you dear brother cole
cole's judgment is as crab's you see
lady we swear to speak and write what you please so all go right
then as we gave directions spread abroad in cadiz madrid granada and medina and all the royal cities of the realm th' ambitious hopes of that proud bastard philip and sometimes as you see occasion tickle the ears of the rude multitude with eleazar's praise gild his virtues naples' recovery and his victories achiev'd against the turkish ottoman
will you do this for us
why start you back and stare
o no sir no
but truth to tell seeing your face we thought of hell
hell is a dream
but none do dream in hell
friars stand to her and me and by your sin i'll shoulder out mendoza from his seat and of two friars create you cardinals
o how would cardinals' hats on their heads sit
this face would look most goodly under it
friars crab and cole do swear in those circles still to appear in which she or you do charge us rise for you our lives we'll sacrifice
valete gaudete si pereamus flete orate pro nobis oremus pro vobis
cole will be burnt and crab be press'd ere they prove knaves thus are you cross'd and bless'd
exeunt now madam none shall throw their leaden envy in an opposite scale to weigh down our true golden happiness
yes there is one
give me his name and i will turn it to a magic spell to bind him here here
she's the hellespont divides my love and me she being cut off stay stay cut off
let's think upon't my wife
does her love make thee cold
had i a thousand wives down go they all
she dies i'll cut her off
enter madam the king entreats your company
his pleasure be obey'd
dear love farewell remember your maria
dear adieu with this i'll guard her whilst it stabs at you
points to his sword
my lord the friars are won to join with us
o the word let it be treason
when we cry treason break ope chamber doors kill philip and the cardinal
murder now ride in triumph darkness horror thus i invoke your aid your act begin night is a glorious robe for th' ugliest sin
enter and in trousers the in one of their weeds and putting on the other
put on my lord and fly or else you die
i will not i will die first
cardinal prythee good cardinal pluck off friars slave
he shall not by this sword
my lord you will endanger both our lives
i care not i'll kill some before i die
my lord put on or else god's foot
philip let us fly into the chamber of the mother queen
thunder beat down the lodgings
else let's break into the chamber of the king
a pox upon these lousy gabardines
agreed i am for you moor stand side by side come hands off leave your ducking
hell cannot fright their spirits that do desperately fight
you are too rash you are too hot wild desperateness doth valour blot
the lodging of the king's beset with staring faces black as jet and hearts of iron your deaths are vow'd if you fly that way therefore shroud your body in friar cole's grey weed for is't not madness man to bleed when you may 'scape untouch'd away
here's hell here's heaven here if you stay you're gone you're gone friar crab and i will here dance friskin whilst you fly
gag us bind us come put on the gag's too wide so gone gone gone
o well i'll come again
lord cardinal take you the castle i'll to portugal
i vow i'll come again and if i do nay good my lord
black devil i'll conjure you
to the making a noise gagged and bound enter and other moors all with their swords drawn
guard all the passages
zarack stand there there balthazar there you
where have you plac'd the friars
my lord a noise
the friars are gagg'd and bound
'tis philip and the cardinal shoot ha
where's mendoza and the prince
santa maria who can tell
by peter's keys they bound us well and having crack'd our shaven crowns they have escap'd you in our gowns
i am glad it's good i would their arms may turn to eagles' wings to fly as swift as time
sweet air give way winds leave your two and thirty palaces and meeting all in one join all your might to give them speedy and a prosperous flight
alas what sin is't to shed innocent blood
for look you holy men it is the king the king the king
see friars sulphury wrath having once entered into royal breasts mark how it burns
the queen philip's mother
will have you two divulge abroad that he's a bastard
o will you do it
what says my brother friar
a prince's love is balm their wrath is fire
'tis true but yet i'll publish no such thing what fool would lose his soul to please a king
keep there good there yet for it wounds my soul to see the miserablest wretch to bleed i counsel you in care unto your lives obey the mother queen for by my life i think she has been prick'd in her conscience
o it has stung her for some fact misdone she would not else disgrace herself and son
she'll work your deaths else hate bred in woman is insatiate
brother cole zeal sets me in a flame i'll do't
and i his baseness we'll proclaim
exeunt do and be damn'd zarack and balthazar dog them at the heels and when their poisonous breath hath scatter'd this infection on the hearts of credulous spaniards here reward them thus points to his sword
slaves too much trusted do grow dangerous
why this shall feed and fat suspicion and my policy
i'll ring through all the court this loud alarum that they contriv'd the murder of the king the queen and me and being undermin'd to 'scape the blowing up they fled
there there thou there cry treason each one take a several door your cries my music make
where is the king
enter in his shirt his sword drawn
where is the sleeping queen
rise rise and arm against the hand of treason
whence comes this sound of treason
enter the in his shirt his sword drawn
who frights our quiet slumbers with this heavy noise
enter in her night attire
was it a dream or did the sound of monster treason call me from my rest
who rais'd this rumour
i did my liege and still continue it both for your safety and mine own discharge
whence comes the ground then
from the cardinal and the young prince who bearing in his mind the true idea of his late disgrace in putting him from the protectorship and envying the advancement of the moor determined this night to murder you and for your highness lodged within my castle they would have laid the murder on my head
the cardinal and my brother
bring them forth their lives shall answer this ambitious practice
my lord it is impossible for when they saw i had discovered them they train'd two harmless friars to their lodgings disrob'd them gagg'd them bound them to two posts and in their habits did escape the castle
the cardinal is all ambition and from him doth our brother gather heart
th' ambition of the one infects the other and in a word they both are dangerous but might your mother's counsel stand in force i would advise you send the trusty moor to fetch them back before they have seduc'd the squint ey'd multitude from true allegiance and drawn them to their dangerous faction
it shall be so
therefore my state's best prop within whose bosom i durst trust my life both for my safety and thine own discharge fetch back those traitors and till your return ourself will keep your castle
my liege the tongue of true obedience must not gainsay his sovereign's impose
i will not kiss the cheek of sleep till i have fetched those traitors to the court
why this sorts right he gone his beauteous wife shall sail into the naked arms of love
why this is as it should be he once gone his wife that keeps me from his marriage bed shall by this hand of mine be murdered
this storm is well nigh past the swelling clouds that hang so full of treason by the wind in awful majesty are scattered
then each man to his rest
good night sweet friend
whilst thou pursu'st the traitors that are fled fernando means to warm thy marriage bed
many good nights consume and damn your souls
i know he means to cuckold me this night yet do i know no means to hinder it besides who knows whether the lustful king having my wife and castle at command will ever make surrender back again
but if he do not with my falchion's point i'll lance those swelling veins in which hot lust does keep his revels and with that warm blood where venus' bastard cooled his swelt'ring spleen wash the disgrace from eleazar's brow
if they lock the gates i'll toss a ball of wildfire o'er the walls
or else swim o'er the moat and make a breach thorough the flinty sides of the rebellious walls
hear me dear heart
or undermine the chamber where they lie and by the violent strength of gunpowder blow up the castle and th' incestuous couch in which lust wallows but my labouring thoughts wading too deep in bottomless extremes do drown themselves in their own stratagems
sweet husband dwell not upon circumstance when weeping sorrow like an advocate importunes you for aid look in mine eye there you shall see dim grief swimming in tears invocating succour
to shield me from fernando's unchaste love who with uncessant prayers importun'd me to lie with you
then seek some means how to prevent it
'tis impossible for to the end that his unbridled lust might have more free access unto thy bed this night he hath enjoined me to fetch back philip and the cardinal
then this ensuing night shall give an end to all my sorrows for before foul lust shall soil the fair complexion of mine honour this hand shall rob maria of her life
not so dear soul for in extremities choose out the least and ere the hand of death should suck this ivory palace of thy life embrace my counsel and receive this poison which in the instant he attempts thy love then give it him do do do poison him
he gone thou'rt next be sound in resolution and farewell
by one and one i'll ship you all to hell
spain i will drown thee with thine own proud blood then make an ark of carcases farewell
revenge and i will sail in blood to hell
my trembling hand would let the poison fall and through my cheeks fear suited in a bloodless livery would make the world acquainted with my guilt
but thanks prevention i have found a means both to preserve my royal sovereign's life and keep myself a true and loyal wife
enter with a torch
fair eldest child of love thou spotless night empress of silence and the queen of sleep who with thy black cheeks' pure complexion mak'st lovers' eyes enamour'd of thy beauty thou art like my moor therefore will i adore thee for lending me this opportunity o with the soft skinn'd negro
heavens keep back the saucy staring day from the world's eye until my eleazar make return then in his castle shall he find his wife transform'd into a strumpet by my son then shall he hate her whom he would not kill then shall i kill her whom i cannot love
the king is sporting with his concubine
blush not my boy be bold like me thy mother
but their delights torture my soul like devils except her shame be seen wherefore awake
raise the court arise you peers of spain alvero rise preserve your country from base infamies
enter at several doors with lights and rapiers drawn and with others
who rais'd these exclamations through the court
sheathe up your swords you need not swords but eyes to intercept this treason
ring the larum bell cry arm through all the city once before the horrid cry of treason did affright our sleeping spirits
stay you need not cry arm arm
for this black deed works treason to your king to me to you to spain and all that shall in spain ensue
this night maria eleazar's wife hath drawn the king by her lascivious looks privately to a banquet i unseen stood and beheld him in her lustful arms o god
shall bastards wear spain's diadem
if you can kneel to baseness vex them not if you disdain to kneel wash off this blot
let's break into the chamber and surprise her
do do break in my country shall not blush at my child's sin
delay is nurse to danger follow me come you and witness to her villany
hapless alvero how art thou undone in a light daughter and a stubborn son
exeunt enter with his rapier drawn in one hand leading seeming affrighted in the other
o kill me ere you stain my chastity
my hand holds death but love sits in mine eye
exclaim not dear maria do but hear me
though thus in dead of night as i do now the lustful tarquin stole to the chaste bed of collatine's fair wife yet shall thou be no lucrece nor thy king a roman slave to make rude villany thine honour's grave
why from my bed have you thus frighted me
to let thee view a bloody horrid tragedy
begin it then i'll gladly lose my life rather than be an emperor's concubine
by my high birth i swear thou shalt be none the tragedy i'll write with my own hand a king shall act it and a king shall die except sweet mercy's beam shine from thine eye
if this affright thee it shall sleep for ever
if still thou hate me thus this noble blade this royal purple temple shall invade
my husband is from hence for his sake spare me
thy husband is no spaniard thou art one so is fernando then for country's sake let me not spare thee on thy husband's face eternal night in gloomy shades doth dwell but i'll look on thee like the gilded sun when to the west his fiery horses run
true here you look on me with sunset eyes for by beholding you my glory dies
call me thy morning then for like the morn in pride maria shall through spain be borne
this music was prepar'd to please thine ears love me and thou shalt hear no other sounds
a banquet brought in
lo here's a banquet set with mine own hands love me and thus i'll feast thee like a queen
i might command thee being thy sovereign but love me and i'll kneel and sue to thee and circle this white forehead with the crown of castile portugal and arragon and all those petty kingdoms which do bow their tributary knees to philip's heir
i cannot love you whilst my husband lives
i'll send him to the wars and in the front of some main army shall he nobly die
i cannot love you if you murder him
for thy sake then i'll call a parliament and banish by a law all moors from spain
i'll wander with him into banishment
it shall be death for any negro's hand to touch the beauty of a spanish dame
come come what needs such cavils with a king
night blinds all jealous eyes and we may play
carouse that bowl to me i'll pledge all this being down we'll make it more sweet with a kiss
begin i'll lock all doors begin spain's queen locks the doors
love's banquet is most sweet when 'tis least seen
o thou conserver of my honour's life instead of poisoning him drown him in sleep
because i'll quench the flames of wild desire i'll drink this off let fire conquer love's fire
were love himself in real substance here thus would i drink him down let your sweet strings speak louder pleasure is but a slave to kings in which love swims
maria kiss thy king circle me in this ring of ivory o i grow dull and the cold hand of sleep hath thrust his icy fingers in my breast and made a frost within me
sweet one kiss to thaw this deadness that congeals my soul
your majesty hath overwatch'd yourself
he sleeps already not the sleep of death but a sweet slumber which the powerful drug instill'd through all his spirits
o bright day bring home my dear lord ere his king awake else of his unstain'd bed he'll shipwreck make
enter and dancing before him and music with them
what shapes are these
my sovereign lord awake save poor maria
he cannot save thee save that pain before he wake thou shalt be slain his mother's hand shall stop thy breath thinking her own son is done to death and she that takes away thy life does it to be thy husband's wife adieu maria we must hence embrace thine end with patience
elves and fairies make no stand till you come in fairyland
exeunt dancing and singing
fairies or devils whatsoe'er you be thus will i hide me from your company
to her enter suddenly with and with rapiers
lay hold upon the strumpet
your king is dead
lay hands upon the murd'ress
imperious queen i am as free from murder as thyself which i will prove if you will hear me speak
the king is living
if he liv'd his breath would beat within his breast
the life he leads maria thou shalt soon participate
o father save me
thou'rt no child of mine
hadst thou been owner of alvero's spirit thy heart would not have entertain'd a thought that had convers'd with murder yet mine eyes howe'er my tongue wants words brimful with tears entreat her further trial
here lies her trial from this royal breast hath she stolen all comfort all the life of every bosom in the realm of spain
she's both a traitor and a murd'ress
i'll have her forthwith strangled
to heaven let her complain if she have wrong i murder but the murd'ress of my son
we murder but the murd'ress of our king
o o cease your torturing
heaven ope your windows that my spotless soul riding upon the wings of innocence may enter paradise
fairies farewell fernando's death in mine you did foretell
love maria speak o whither art thou fled
whence flow these waters that fall like winter storms from the drown'd eyes
from my maria's death
damn'd be the soul to hell that stopp'd her breath
who durst murder thee
i thought my dear fernando had been dead and in my indignation murder'd her
i was not dead until you murder'd me by killing fair maria
gentle son ungentle mother you a deed have done of so much ruth that no succeeding age can ever clear you of
o my dear love
yet heavens can witness thou wert never mine
spain's wonder was maria
for shedding zealous tears over the tomb of virtuous chastity
you cry have done now i am doing good but cried do on when you were shedding blood
have you done mother
yes yes you have done that which will undo your unhappy son
these words become you not my gracious lord
these words become not me
no more it did become you lords to be mute standers by when lustful fury ravish'd chastity it ill becomes me to lament her death but it became you well to stop her breath
had she been fair and not so virtuous this deed had not been half so impious
but she was fair in virtue virtuous fair
she was true honour's heir
hence beldam from my presence
all fly hence you are all murderers
come poor innocent clasp thy cold hand in mine for here i'll lie and since i liv'd for her for her i'll die
enter with a torch his rapier drawn
bar up my castle gates
fire and confusion shall girt these spanish curs
was i for this sent to raise power against a fugitive
to have my wife deflower'd
my slaves cry out she's dallying with the king stand by where is your king
eleazar's bed shall scorn to be an emperor's brothelry
be patient eleazar here's the king
patience and i am foes
here is her hapless corse that was maria
here lies maria's body here her grave her dead heart in my breast a tomb shall have
now by the proud complexion of my cheeks ta'en from the kisses of the amorous sun were he ten thousand kings that slew my love thus should my hand plum'd with revenge's wings requite mine own dishonour and her death
stabs the ah me
the king is murder'd
lay hold on the damn'd traitor
in his breast that dares but dart a finger at the moor i'll bury this sharp steel yet reeking warm with the unchas'd blood of that lecher king that threw my wife in an untimely grave
she was my daughter and her timeless grave did swallow down my joys as deep as yours
but thus but what
bear injuries that can i'll wear no forked crest
damn this black fiend
cry treason through the court the king is murder'd
he that first opes his lips i'll drive his words down his wide throat upon my rapier's point
the king is murder'd and i'll answer it
i am dishonour'd and i will revenge it
bend not your dangerous weapons at my breast think where you are this castle is the moor's you are environ'd with a wall of flint the gates are lock'd portcullises let down if eleazar spend one drop of blood and above with calivers
on those high turret tops my slaves stand arm'd and shall confound your souls with murd'ring shot or if you murder me yet underground a villain that for me will dig to hell stands with a burning linstock in his fist who firing gunpowder up in the air shall fling your torn and mangled carcases
o sheathe your weapons though my son be slain yet save yourselves choose a new sovereign
prince philip is our sovereign choose him king
prince philip shall not be my sovereign
philip's a bastard and fernando's dead
mendoza sweats to wear spain's diadem philip has sworn confusion to this realm
they both are up in arms war's flames do shine like lightning in the air
wherefore my lords look well on eleazar value me not by my sunburnt cheeks nor by my birth but by my loss of blood which i have sacrific'd in spain's defence
then look on philip and the cardinal look on those gaping curs whose wide throats stand stretch'd wide open like the gates of death to swallow you your country children wives
philip cries fire and blood the cardinal cries likewise fire and blood
i'll quench those flames
the moor cries blood and fire and that shall burn till castile like proud troy to cinders turn
lay by these ambages what seeks the moor
a kingdom castile's crown
peace devil for shame
peace doating lord for shame
o misery when indian slaves thirst after empery
princes and peers of spain we are beset with horror on each side if you deny him death stands at all our backs we cannot fly him
crown philip king the crown upon his head will prove a fiery meteor war and vengeance and desolation will invade our land
besides prince philip is a bastard born
o give me leave to blush at mine own shame but i for love to you love to fair spain choose rather to rip up a queen's disgrace than by concealing it to set the crown upon a bastard's head wherefore my lords by my consent crown that proud blackamoor
since spain's bright glory must so soon grow dim since it must end let it end all in him
eleazar shall be king
have you so soon ras'd out fernando's love
so soon forgot the duty of true peers
so soon so soon buried a mother's name that you will crown him king that slew your king
will you hear him or me
who shall be king
eleazar shall be castile's sovereign
do do make haste to crown him
lords adieu here hell must be when the devil governs you
by heaven's great star which indians do adore but that i hate to hear the giddy world shame that i waded to a crown through blood i'd not digest his pills but since my lords you have chosen eleazar for your king invest me with a general applause
live eleazar castile's royal king
a villain and a base born fugitive
a bloody tyrant and usurping slave
thanks to you all 'tis not the spanish crown that eleazar strives for but spain's peace
amongst you i'll divide her empery christofero shall wear granada's crown to roderigo i'll give arragon naples navarre and fair jerusalem i'll give to other three and then our viceroys shall shine about our bright castilian crown as stars about the sun
cry all arm arm prince philip and the cardinal do ride like jove in thunder in a storm we'll meet them
go levy powers if any man must fall my death shall first begin the funeral
enter and with calivers
is thy cock ready and thy powder dry
my cock stands perching like a cock o' the game with a red coal for his crest instead of a comb and for my powder 'tis but touch and take
i have tickling gear too anon i'll cry here i have it and yonder i see it
but zarack is't policy for us to kill these bald pates
is't policy for us to save ourselves
if they live we die
is't not wisdom then to send them to heaven rather than be sent ourselves
come you black slave be resolute
this way they come here they will stand and yonder will i stand
and in yonder hole our amiable faces cannot be seen if we keep close therefore hide your cock's head lest his burning cock's comb betray us
but soft which of the two shall be thy white
that black villain friar cole
i shall have a sharp piece of service friar crab shall be my man
farewell and be resolute
zarack i shall never have the heart to do it
you rogue think who commands eleazar
who shall rise balthazar
who shall die a lousy friar
who shall live our good lord and master the negro king of spain
cole thou art but a dead man and shalt turn to ashes
crab here's that shall make vinegar of thy carcase
enter and two friars with a rout of stinkards following them
brother 'tis best so
now we have drawn them to a head we'll begin here i' the market place
tut so long as we be commanded by the mother queen we'll say her son is a bastard an' he were ten philips
take you one market form i'll take another
no god's so' we must both keep one form
ay in oration but not in station
well my masters you know him not so well as i on my word
friar crab is a sour fellow
d yet he may utter sweet doctrine by your leave
but what think you of friar cole
all fire an' he be kindled once a hot catholic
d and you mark him he has a zealous nose and richly inflamed
here's a queasy beginning methinks
brethren citizens and market folks of seville
well beloved and honoured castilians
it is not unknown to you
i am sure you are not ignorant
how villanous and strong
how monstrous and huge
the faction of prince philip is
philip that is a bastard
philip that is a dastard
philip that killed your king
only to make himself king
and by gad's blessed lady you are all damned and you suffer it
friar cole says true he speaks out to the heat of his zeal look how he glows
d well friar crab for my money he has set my teeth an edge against this bastard
o his words are like vergis to whet a man's stomach
your noble king the moor is a valiant gentleman a noble gentleman an honourable gentleman a fair black gentleman
a friend to castilians a champion for castilians a man fit to be a king
if he were not borne down by him that would be king who as i said before is a bastard and no king
what think you my masters
do you mark his words well
further compare them together
there's no comparison between them
nay but hear us good countrymen
set that bastard and eleazar together
mean you by the ears
no but compare them
do but compare them
we say again comparisons are odious
but say on say on
pieces go off friars die
every man shift for himself
this is philip's treason
enter and zarack and balthazar are they despatch'd
we saw 'em sprawl and turn up the white of the eye
so shall they perish that lay countermines to cross our high designments by their habits the cardinal and philip 'scap'd our nets and by your hands they tasted our revenge
enter here comes the queen away
under our wings you shall stand safe and brave the proudest kings
o fly my eleazar save thy life else 'point a guard about thee the mad people tempestuous like the sea run up and down some crying kill the bastard some the moor some cry god save king philip and some cry god save the moor some others he shall die
are these your fears
thus blow them into air
i rushed amongst the thickest of their crowds and with a countenance majestical like the imperious sun dispers'd their clouds i have perfumed the rankness of their breath and by the magic of true eloquence transform'd this many headed cerberus this pied chamelion this beast multitude whose power consists in number pride in threats yet melt like snow when majesty shines forth this heap of fools who crowding in huge swarms stood at our court gates like a heap of dung reeking and shouting out contagious breath of power to poison all the elements this wolf i held by th' ears and made him tame and made them tremble at the moor's great name no we must combat with a grimmer foe that damn'd mendoza overturns our hopes
he loves you dearly
by his secret letters he hath entreated me to leave the court and fly into his arms
the world cannot devise a stratagem sooner to throw confusion on his pride
subscribe to his desires and in dead night steal to his castle swear to him his love hath drawn you thither undermine his soul and learn what villanies are there laid up then for your pleasure walk to take the air near to the castle i'll in ambush lie and seem by force to take you prisoner this done i have a practice plotted here shall rid him of his life and us of fear
about it madam this is all in all we cannot stand unless mendoza fall
enter king of portugal with drums and soldiers marching
how is the body of thy peace mangled and torn by an ambitious moor
how is thy prince and councillors abus'd and trodden under the base foot of scorn
wrong'd lords emanuel of portugal partakes a falling share in all your miseries and though the tardy hand of slow delay withheld us from preventing your mishaps yet shall revenge dart black confusion into the bosom of that damned fiend
but is it possible our mother queen should countenance his ambition
her advice is as a steersman to direct his course besides as we by circumstance have learnt she means to marry him
then here upon my knees i pluck allegiance from her all that love which by innative duty i did owe her shall henceforth be converted into hate
this will confirm the world's opinion that i am base born and the damned moor had interest in my birth this wrong alone gives new fire to the cinders of my rage i may be well transform'd from what i am when a black devil is husband to my dam
prince let thy rage give way to patience and set a velvet brow upon the face of wrinkled anger our keen swords must right these wrongs and not light airy words
yet words may make the edge of rage more sharp and whet a blunted courage with revenge
here's none wants whetting for our keen resolves are steel'd unto the back with double wrongs wrongs that would make a handless man take arms wrongs that would make a coward resolute
why then join all our several wrongs in one and from these wrongs assume a firm resolve to send this devil to damnation
i hear the sound of his approaching march
stand fair saint jacques for the right of spain
enter the with drums colours and soldiers marching bravely
thou true stamp'd son of hell thy pedigree is written in thy face
alarum and a battle the prevails all exeunt
enter and move forward with your main battalion or else all's lost
i will not move a foot
will you lose the day
you lose your wits you're mad it is no policy
a pox upon't cardinal come on second the desperate vanguard which is mine and where i'll die or win
follow my sword the bloody way i lead it or by heaven i'll play the devil and mar all
we'll turn our backs upon the moors and set on thee ay thee thee cardinal
your desperate arm hath almost thrust quite through the heart of hope our fortunes lie a bleeding by your rash and violent onset
will you not fight
we will not hazard all upon one cast
by deeds i'll try
whether your venomous tongue says true
farewell courage shines both in this and policy
to save thy skin whole that's thy policy
you whoreson fat chapp'd guts ill melt away that larded body by the heat of fight which i'll compel thee to or else by flying to work which i'll give way to the proud foe
whilst i stand laughing to behold you run
cardinal i'll do't i'll do't a moor a moor
philip cries a moor
here plague where's the moor
the moor's a devil never did horrid fiend compell'd by some magician's mighty charm break through the prisons of the solid earth with more strange horror than this prince of hell this damned negro lion like doth rush through all and spite of all knit opposition
i'll meet him where
'tis not his arm that acts such wonders but our cowardice
this cardinal o this cardinal is a slave
enter sound a retreat or else the day is lost
i'll beat that dog to death that sounds retreat
i'll tear his heart out that dares name that sound
you tempt my sword sir continue this alarum fight pell mell fight kill be damn'd
this fat back coward cardinal lies heavy on my shoulders this ay this shall fling him off
ambition plumes the moor whilst black despair offering to tear from him the diadem which he usurps makes him to cry at all and to act deeds beyond astonishment
but philip is the night that darks his glories this sword yet reeking with his negro's blood being grasp'd by equity and this strong arm shall through and through
stay stand stand fast fight
a moor a moor
enter and others they fight moors are all beat in
manet weary a moor lies slain
o for more work more souls to post to hell that i might pile up charon's boat so full until it topple o'er
o 'twould be sport to see them sprawl through the black slimy lake
there's one going thither sirrah
you you slave who kill'd thee
this breast had it been temper'd and made proof like mine it never would have been a mark for fools to hit afar off with their dastard bullets
but thou didst well thou knew'st i was thy lord and out of love and duty to me here where i fell weary thou laidst down thyself to bear me up thus god a mercy slave a king for this shall give thee a rich grave
as he sits down enter with a broken sword
i'll wear thee to the pommel but i'll find the subject of mine honour and revenge
moor 'tis for thee i seek
come now now take me at good advantage
fate and revenge i thank you
villain it is philippo that bids rise
it had been good for thee to have hid thy name for the discovery like to a dangerous charm hurts him that finds it
wherefore do those bloodhounds thy rage and valour chase me
what a blunt axe
think'st thou i'll let thy fury take a full blow at this head having these arms
be wise go change thy weapon
i'll stay thy coming
thou'lt be damn'd first
by all our indian gods puh
thou know'st 'tis for a kingdom which we fight and for that who'll not venture to hell gates
come moor i'm arm'd with more than complete steel the justice of my quarrel when i look upon my father's wrongs my brother's wounds my mother's infamy spain's misery and lay my finger here o 'tis too dull to let out blood enough to quench them all
but when i see your face and know what fears hang on thy troubled soul like leaden weights to make it sink i know this finger's touch has strength to throw thee down i know this iron is sharp and long enough to reach that head
fly not devil if thou do how
stay philip whosoe'er begat thee why slave a king begat me
may be so but i'll be sworn thy mother was a queen for her sake will i kill thee nobly
fling me thy sword there's mine
i scorn to strike a man disarm'd
for this dishonouring me i'll give thee one stab more
i'll run away unless thou change that weapon or take mine
stay and if you dare do as i do oppose thy naked breast against this poniard see
here's this for thine
i am for thee philip
come nay take more ground that with a full career thou may'st strike home
thou'lt run away then
thou'lt run away then
faith i will but first on this i'll bear thy panting heart thy head upon thy spear
enter and on the one and on the other side
side upon the moors
side upon the cardinal
hold cardinal strike not any of our side
hold moors strike not any of our side
we two will close this battle
stand armies and give aim whilst we two bleed
'tis too desperate dear philip
have at the moor
be arm'd with manly weapons 'tis for slaves to dig their own and such unworthy graves
i am for thee any way thus or see thus here try the vigour of thy sinewy arm
the day is ours already brainless heads and bleeding bodies like a crown do stand about the temples of our victory
yet spaniards if you dare we'll fight it out thus man to man alone
i'll first begin and conquer or in blood wade up to the chin
let not a weapon stir but his and mine
nor on this side conquest in blood shall shine
alarum they fight the moor is struck down which his side seeing step all in and rescue him the rest join and drive in the moors
alarum continuing spaniards and moors with drums and colours fly over the stage pursued by and others
enter and at several doors
where is my lord
where is my sovereign
what news brings zarack and christofero
o fly my lords fly for the day is lost
there are three hundred and odd days in a year and cannot we lose one of them
the lords have left us and the soldiers faint you are round beset with proud fierce enemies death cannot be prevented but by flight
i have yet left one stratagem that in despite of fate shall turn the wheel of war about once more
the mother queen hath all this while sat sadly within our tent expecting to whose bosom white winged peace and victory will fly her have i us'd as a fit property to stop this dangerous current her have i sent arm'd with love's magic to enchant the cardinal and bind revenge down with resistless charms by this time does she hang about his neck and by the witchcraft of a cunning kiss has she disarm'd him
they sound retreat she has prevail'd a woman's tongue and eye are weapons stronger than artillery
enter drums and colours
by all those sighs which thou like passionate tunes hast often to my dull ears offered by all thy hopes to enjoy my royal bed by all those mourning lines which thou hast sent weeping in black to tell thy languishment by love's best richest treasure which i swear i will bestow and which none else shall wear as the most prized jewel but thyself by that bright fire which flaming through thine eyes from thy love scorched bosom does arise i do conjure thee let no churlish sound with war's lewd horror my desires confound
dear dear mendoza thus i do entreat that still thou wouldst continue this retreat i'll hang upon thee till i hear thee say woman prevail or chiding cri'st away
is there no trick in this forg'd by the moor
i would the moor's damnation were the ransom of all the innocent blood that has been shed in this black day i care not for the moor love to my kingdom's peace makes me put on this habit of a suppliant shall i speed
you shall were it to have my bosom bleed i have no power to spare the negro's head when i behold the wounds which his black hand has given mine honour but when i look on you i have no power to hate him since your breath dissolves my frozen heart being spent for him in you my life must drown itself or swim
you have prevail'd drum swiftly hence call back our fierce pursuing troops that run to catch the laurel wreath of conquest let it stand awhile untouch'd by any soldier's hand
stay you and guard us
i'll lose what i have got a victor's prize yielding myself a prisoner to your eyes
mine eyes shall quickly grant you liberty
the moor stays my return i'll put on wings and fetch him to make peace belongs to kings
as she goes out enter and soldiers well armed at sight of each other all draw
soldiers call back the drum we are betray'd
moors stand upon your guard avoid look back
what means this jealousy
mendoza moor lay by your weapons and embrace the sight of this and this begets suspicion
eleazar by my birth he comes in peace mendoza by mine honour so comes he
discharge these soldiers then
soul rejoice to see this glorious day
she joins them together they embrace
your virtues work this wonder
i have met at her most dear command what's your desires
peace and your honour'd arms how loathingly i sounded the alarums witness heaven
'twas not to strike your breast but to let out the rank blood of ambition
that philip makes you his ladder and being climb'd so high as he may reach a diadem there you lie
he's base begotten that's his mother's sin
but he's a bastard and rather than i'll kneel to him i'll saw my legs off by the thighs because i'll stand in spite of reverence he's a bastard he's
and to beat down his usurpation i have thrown about this thunder but mendoza the people hate him for his birth he only leans on you you are his pillar you gone he walks on crutches or else falls
then shrink from under him are not they fools that bearing others up themselves seem low because they above sit high why you do so
behold this error with fix'd eyes
o have you found it
have you smelt the train of powder that must blow you up up into air
why this a breath look you in this time may a king meet death
have an eye to't check it check it
thus steal from the heat of that incestuous blood where ravish'd honour and philippo lies leave him divide this huge and monstrous body of armed spaniards into limbs thus big part man from man send every soldier home i'll do the like peace with an olive branch shall fly with dovelike wings about all spain the crown which i as a good husband keep i will lay down upon the empty chair marry you the queen and fill it for my part these knees are yours sir
if you prove false if i do let fire fall amen
upon thy head aside and so it shall
all of myself is yours soldiers begone
and that way you
the rest i will divide the lords shall be convented
here anon this aside is thy winding sheet
exit the moor walks up and down musing
what shape will this prodigious womb bring forth which groans with such strange labour
why eleazar art thou rapt with joys or does thy sinking policy make to shore
well so you turn my brains you mar the face of my attempts i' the making for this chaos this lump of projects ere it be lick'd over 'tis like a bear's conception stratagems being but begot and not got out are like charg'd cannons not discharg'd they do no harm nor good
true policy breeding in the brain is like a bar of iron whose ribs being broken and soften'd in the fire you then may forge it into a sword to kill or to a helmet to defend life
'tis therefore wit to try all fashions ere you apparel villany
but but i ha' suited him fit fit o fit
why thus yet no let's hence my heart is nearest of my council yet i scarce dare trust my heart with't what i do it shall look old the hour wherein 'tis born wonders twice seen are garments overworn
enter at one door half armed and two following him with the rest of the armour the seeing him turns back again
i am not for your lure
for that then o touching his sword that it had nail'd thy heart up to the pommel to the earth come arm me
when all our swords were royally gilt with blood when with red sweat that trickled from our wounds we had dearly earn'd a victory when hell had from their hinges heav'd off her iron gates to bid the damn'd moor and the devils enter then to lose all then to sound base retreat why soldiers ha
i am glad of it my lord
art glad i am dishonoured that thou and he have me dishonoured
why my lord i am glad that you so cleanly did come off
thou hast a lean face and a carrion heart a plague on him and thee too then 'sheart
then to crack the very heart strings of our army to quarter it in pieces i could tear my hair and in cursing spend my soul cardinal
come we'll fight till there be left but one if i be he i'll die a glorious death
so will i i hope in my bed
d till there be but one left my lord
why that's now for all our fellows are crawled home some with one leg some ne'er an arm some with their brains beaten out and glad they 'scaped so
but my dear countrymen you'll stick to me
ay my lord stick like bandogs till we be pulled off
that's nobly said i'll lead you but to death where i'll have greatest share we shall win fame for life and that doth crown a soldier's name
to death my lord
not i by gad's lid i have a poor wife and children at home and if i die they beg and do you think i'll see her go up and down the wide universal world
for every drop of blood which thou shalt lose coward i'll give thy wife a wedge of gold
d hang him meacock
my lord arm yourself i'll fight for you till i have not an eye to see the fire in my touch hole
be thou a king's companion thou and i will dare the cardinal and the moor to fight in single combat shall we ha
we'll beat'm to hell gate shall we ha
d hell gate's somewhat too hot somewhat too hot the porter's a knave i'd be loth to be damned for my conscience i'll knock any body's costard so i knock not there my lord hell gates
a pox upon such slaves
hang him a peasant
my lord you see i am but a scrag my lord my legs are not of the biggest nor the least nor the best that e'er were stood upon nor the worst but they are of god's making and for your sake if ever we put our enemies to flight again by gad's lid if i run not after them like a tiger hough me
but wilt thou stand to't ere they fly ha wilt thou
will i quoth a
by this hand and the honour of a soldier
and by a soldier's honour i will load thee with spanish pistolets to have this head thy face and all thy body stuck with scars why 'tis a sight more glorious than to see a lady hung with diamonds
if thou lose a hand i'll send this after if an arm i'll lend thee one of mine come then let's fight
a mangled lame true soldier is a gem worth ca|sar's empire though fools spurn at them
yet my lord i have seen lame soldiers not worth the crutches they leant upon hands and arms quoth he
not i'll double my files or stand sentry or so but i'll be hanged and quartered before i'll have my members cut off
d and i too hold thee there
hold you both there away you rogues you dirt
beats them both in
thus do i tread upon you out begone
one valiant is an host fight then alone
for the crown of spain come all
we come in love and peace
but come in war bring naked swords not laurel boughs in peace
plague on your rank peace
will you fight and cry down with the moor
and then i'm yours i'll die
i have a heart two arms a soul a head i'll lay that down i'll venture all 'sfoot all
come tread upon me so that moor may fall
by heaven that moor shall fall
thy hand and thine
flings down his weapons
give me but half your hearts you have all mine by heaven shall he fall
yes upon thee like to the ruins of a tower to grind thy body into dust
traitor and bastard i do arrest thee of high treason
lay hands upon him
you're best do so
alvero there's the warrant to your hands the prisoner is committed
lords let's part look to him on your life
the devil and his dam the moor and my mother their warrant i will not obey old greybeard thou shalt not be my jailer there's no prison no dungeon deep enough no grates so strong that can keep in a man so mad with wrong
what dost thou weep
i would fain shed a tear but from mine eyes so many show'rs are gone grief drinks my tears so fast that here's not one
you must to prison
dost thou speak to me
you must to prison
and from thence to death
i thought i should have had a tomb hung round with tatter'd colours broken spears i thought my body should have fallen down full of wounds but one can kill an emperor fool then why wouldst thou have many
curse be mad and die
enter and two bare headed before them alone and bearing the crown on a cushion next after him other lords after her sad meets them
alvero 'tis the pleasure of the king of the queen mother and these honoured states to ease you of philippo there's a warrant sent to remove him to a stronger guard
i thank you you shall rid me of much care
sit down and take your place
if i might have the place i like best it should be my grave
the moors stand aside with the crown rising takes it
stand in voice reach away
princes of spain if in this royal court there sit a man that having laid his hold so fast on such a jewel and dare wear it in the contempt of envy as i dare yet uncompell'd as freely as poor pilgrims bestow their prayers would give such wealth away let such a man step forth what do none rise
no no for kings indeed are deities and who'd not as the sun in brightness shine
to be the greatest is to be divine
who among millions would not be the mightiest to sit in godlike state to have all eyes dazzled with admiration and all tongues shouting loud prayers to rob every heart of love to have the strength of every arm a sovereign's name
why 'tis a sovereign charm this glory roundabout me hath thrown beams i have stood upon the top of fortune's wheel and backward turn'd the iron screw of fate
the destinies have spun a silken thread about my life yet noble spaniards see hoc tantum tanti thus i cast aside the shape of majesty and on my knee kneels the fetches the crown and sets it on the chair
to this imperial state lowly resign this usurpation wiping off your fears which stuck so hard upon me let a hand a right and royal hand take up this wreath and guard it right is of itself most strong no kingdom got by cunning can stand long
proceed to new election of a king
stay peers of spain if young philippo be philip's son then is he philip's heir then must his royal name be set in gold philip is then the diamond to that ring
but if he be a bastard here's his seat for baseness has no gall till it grow great
first therefore let him blood if he must bleed yet in what vein you strike him best take heed the portugal's his friend you saw he came at holding up a finger arm'd this peace rid hence his dangerous friendship he's at home
but when he hears that philip is tied up
yet hears not why he'll catch occasion's lock and on that narrow bridge make shift to lead a scrambling army through the heart of spain look to't being in he'll hardly out again
therefore first prove and then proclaim him bastard
how shall we prove it
he that put him out to making i am sure can tell if not then she that shap'd him can here's the queen mother being prick'd in conscience and preferring spain before her own respect will name the man
if he be noble and a spaniard born he'll hide th' apparent scars of their infamies with the white hand of marriage that and time will eat the blemish off say shall it
spaniard or moor the saucy slave shall die
death is too easy for such villany
spaniard or moor the saucy slave shall die
i would he might i know myself am clear as is the new born infant
be bold to speak shame in the grave wants sense heaven with sin's greatest forfeits can dispense
would i were cover'd with the veil of night you might not see red shame sit on my cheeks but being spain's common safety stands for truth hiding my weeping eyes i blush and say philippo's father sits here
the lord mendoza did beget that son o let not this dishonour further run
yes yes even he
spaniard or moor the saucy slave shall die
comes down the rest talk
nay deny me not now may a kingdom and my love be got
those eyes and tongue bewitch me shame lie here that love has sweetest taste that is bought dear
what answers lord mendoza to the queen
i confess guilty philip is my son her majesty hath nam'd the time and place
to you but not to us go forward madam
within the circle of twice ten years since your deceas'd king made war in barbary won tunis conquer'd fez and hand to hand slew great abdela king of fez and father to that barbarian prince
i was but young but now methinks i see my father's wounds poor barbaria
no more in absence of my lord mourning his want to me alone being in my private walk i think at salamanca yes 'twas there enters mendoza under show of shrift threatens my death if i denied his lust in fine by force he won me to his will i wept and cried for help but all in vain
mendoza there abus'd the bed of spain
spaniard or moor that saucy slave shall die
why did you not complain of this vile act
i was alone young full of fear bashful and doubtful of my own defame knowing king philip rash and jealous i hid his sins thinking to hide my shame
what says the cardinal
such a time there was 'tis pass'd i'll make amends with marriage and satisfy with trentals dirges prayers the offended spirit of the wronged king
spaniard or moor the saucy slave shall die
o 'twould seem best it should be thus mendoza she to accuse i urge and both conclude your marriage like a comic interlude
lords will you hear this hateful sin confess'd and not impose upon the ravisher death the due punishment
o it must be so
what does the queen desire
justice revenge on vile mendoza for my ravishment
i kiss the cold earth with my humble knees from whence i will not rise till some just hand cast to the ground the traitor cardinal
swells your heart so high
down lecher if you will not stand then lie
you have betray'd me by my too much trust i never did this deed of rape and lust
your tongue confess'd it
true i was entic'd
do you believe that
justice lords sentence the cardinal for his hateful sin
we will assemble all the states of spain and as they judge so justice shall be done
to prison with the cardinal
damn'd slave my tongue shall go at liberty to curse thee ban that strumpet dogs keep off
i cannot brook his sight
you must to prison and be patient
my fears are that those drops will change to bloody tears
this woman and this serpent drag him hence
who dares lay hands upon me
lords of spain let your swords bail me this false queen did lie
spaniard or moor the saucy slave shall die
i'll fight thee damned hellhound for my life
spaniard or moor the saucy slave shall die
i'll prove upon thy head the slave shall die
lords stop this villain's throat
shall die shall die
hear me but speak
words are ill spent where wrong sits judge you're arm'd if innocent
well then i must to prison moor no more
heavens thou art just
prince philip i betray'd and now myself fall guile with guile is paid
philip being prov'd a bastard who shall sit upon this empty throne
and i not sit there who shall then
if she touch it she'll bewitch the chair this throne belongs to isabel the fair
bring forth the princess dress'd in royal robes the true affecter of alvero's son virtuous hortenzo
lords behold your queen
enter in royal robes and thou villain what intend'st thou savage slave
to advance virtue thus and thus to tread on lust on murder on adultery's head
look lords upon your sovereign isabel though all may doubt the fruits of such a womb is she not like king philip
she rule ay she
a child to sway an empire
i am her protectress i'll pour black curses on thy damned head if thou wrong'st me
princes of spain be deaf be blind hear not behold her not she kill'd my virtuous wife
he kill'd your king
'twas in my just wrath
'twas to get his crown
why here 'tis thou slew'st my maria to have access to my unstained bed
'tis true how often have i stopp'd thy unchaste songs from passing through mine ears
how oft when thy luxurious arms have twin'd about my jetty neck have i cried out away those scalding veins burn me 'tis true
devil 'tis a lie
thou slew'st my sweet maria alvero 'twas thy daughter 'twas hortenzo she was thy sister justice isabella this serpent poison'd thy dear father's bed setting large horns on his imperial head
madam you shall be heard before the courts before the courts of spain
enter two moors and others
to wait on you so many great sins must not wait with few
keep me in prison
were your cause strong we would not arm you so but honour fainting needeth many hands kingdoms stand safe when mischief lies in bands
you must to prison
must must slave i'll damn thee ere thou triumph'st o'er my grave
exit with a guard
manet do do my jocund spleen it does it will it shall
i have at one throw rifled away the diadem of spain 'tis gone and there's no more to set but this at all
then at this last cast i'll sweep up my former petty losses or lose all like to a desperate gamester
except their bodies turn to airy spirits and fly through windows they are safe my lord if they can eat through locks and bars of iron they may escape if not then not
wit is a thief there's picklock policy to whom all doors fly open therefore go in our name charge the keeper to resign his office and if he have tricks of cruelty let him bequeath 'em at his death for kill him
turn all thy body into eyes and watch them let those eyes like fiery comets sparkle out nothing but the death of kings
now thus thou know'st i did invent a torturing iron chain
o for necks my lord
ay that that that away and yoke them
stay enter here's balthazar go both teach them to preach through an iron pillory
i'll spread a net to catch alvero o he is old and wise they are unfit to live that have sharp eyes
hortenzo roderigo to't to't all they have supple knees sleek'd brows but hearts of gall the bitterness shall be wash'd off with blood tyrants swim safest in a crimson flood
i come to tell your grace that isabella is with hortenzo arm in arm at hand zarack and i may kill them now with ease
and then 'tis done
murther thou the man and i'll stab her
no i'll speed her myself
so so look upon this ring whoever brings this token to your hands regard not for what purpose seize on them and chain them to the rest they come away
murder be proud and tragedy laugh on i'll seek a stage for thee to jet upon
enter and seeing the moor they turn back
my lord my lord hortenzo
trust me i saw you not
what makes your grace so sad
she grieves for the imprison'd queen her mother and for philippo in the sandy heap that wait upon an hour there are not found so many little bodies as those sighs and tears which she hath every minute spent since her lov'd brother felt imprisonment
pity great pity would it lay in me to give him liberty
free him your mother queen and cardinal too
not me no no in you
yet for i'll have my conscience white and pure here madam take this ring and if my name can break down castle walls and open gates take it and do't fetch them all forth and yet 'tis unfit you should go
that happy office i'll execute myself
would i stood gracious in their sight
well go do what you will hortenzo if this charm unbinds them here 'tis lady you and i aloof will follow him and when we meet speak for me for i'll kiss philippo's feet
i shall be proud to see all reconcil'd
why true go go
make haste dear love
hortenzo is a man compos'd of sweet proportion has a foot a leg a hand a face an eye a wit the best hortenzo in the spanish court
o he's the nonpareil
your tongue had wont to be more sparing in hortenzo's praise
i may curse his praises rather ban mine own nativity why did this colour dart in my flesh so far
o would my face were of hortenzo's fashion else would yours were as black as mine is
hark i love you yes faith i said this i love you
i do leave him
were you as hard as flint o you should yield like soften'd wax were you as pure as fire i'd touch you yes i'll taint you see you this
i'll bring you to this lure
if i want hands to kill myself before thou dost it do
i'll cut away your hands
well my desire is raging as the sea and mad as fire
torment me not good devil
i'll tear mine eyes out if they tempt thy lust
touch me not these knives ha ha
kill yourself because i jest with you
settle your thoughts 'twas but a trick to try that which few women have true constancy
if then my speeches taste of gall nay faith you are not bitter no you should have rail'd have spit upon me spurn'd me you're not bitter why do you think that i would nurse a thought to hurt your honour
if that thought had brains i'd beat them out
but come by this hortenzo is fast
ay fast in philip's arms wrestling together for the prize of love by this they're on the way i'll be your guard come follow me i'll lead you in the van where aside thou shalt see four chins upon one chain
and chained by the necks
and busy about fastening you damned ministers of villany sworn to damnation by the book of hell you maps of night you element of devils why do you yoke my neck with iron chains
many do borrow chains but you have this gratis for nothing
exeunt the two moors
i am impatient veins why crack you not and tilt your blood into the face of heaven to make red clouds like ensigns in the sky displaying a damn'd tyrant's cruelty
yet can i laugh in my extremest pangs of blood and spirit to see the cardinal keep rank with me and my vile mother queen to see herself where she would have me seen
good fellowship i' faith
and i can tell true misery loves a companion well
thou left'st me to the mercy of a moor that hath damnation dyed upon his flesh 'twas well thou mother didst unmotherly betray thy true son to false bastardy thou left'st me then now thou art found and staid and thou who didst betray me art betray'd
a plague upon you all
thou cursest them whom i may curse first may i curse myself too credulous of loyalty and love next may i curse the moor more than a devil and last thy mother mother of all evil
all curses and all crosses light on thee
what need i curse myself when all curse me
i have been deadly impious i confess forgive me and my sin will seem the less
this heavy chain which now my neck assaults weighs ten times lighter than my heavy faults
hortenzo i commend myself to thee thou that are near'st stand'st furthest off from me
that mould of hell that moor has chain'd me here 'tis not myself but isabel i fear
enter and it's strange
will not prince philip come with hortenzo
he swears he'll live and die there
i pray persuade him you to leave the place
'las here they be
they are they i' faith see see see see
moor devil toad serpent
o sweet airs sweet voices
do not these birds sing sweetly isabella
o how their spirits would leap aloft and spring had they their throats at liberty to sing
and hell swallow thee
sweeter and sweeter still
why there's no music like to misery
hast thou betrayed me thus
not i not sirrah hedgehog
i'll hear thee presently
hear me then hellhound slaves unchain my love or by by what
is't not rare walking here
methinks this stage shows like a tennis court does it not isabel
i'll show thee how suppose that iron chain to be the line the prison doors the hazard and their heads scarce peeping o'er the line suppose the balls
had i a racket now of burnish'd steel how smoothly could i bandy every ball over this globe of earth win set and all
how brisk the villain jets in villany
he's proud because he wears a chain take it off balthazar and take him hence
and whither then you dog
ay come do come
i pray thee kill me come
i hope to see thy own hands do that office
is there another hell
try try he's gone
so him next he next and next him and then worse than damnation
fiend monster of men
slave as thou thrust me down into this dungeon so sink thou to hell
together so and you o pity my hortenzo
farewell my isabel my life adieu
mischief and horror let the moor pursue
that amain play that amain amain amain
no so soon fallen asleep
nay i'll not lose this music sirrah sirrah take thou a drum a trumpet thou and hark mad them with villanous sounds
rare sport let's go
exeunt and about it music will do well in woe
how like you this
set my hortenzo free and i'll like anything
a fool a fool
why look you he free
no then must he marry you you must be queen he in a manner king these dignities like poison make men swell this ratsbane honour o 'tis so sweet
they'll lick it till all burst he will be proud and pride you know must fall
come come he shall not no no 'tis more meet to keep him down safe standing on his feet
mark the imperial chair of spain is now as empty as a miser's alms be wise i yet dare sit in't it's for you if you will be for me there's room for two
do meditate muse on't its best for thee to love me live with me and lie with me
thou know'st i'll first lie in the arms of death
my meditations are how to revenge thy bloody tyrannies
i fear thee not inhuman slave but to thy face defy thy lust thy love thy barbarous villany
i have made them rave and curse and so guard her
your court shall be this prison guard her slaves with open eyes defy me
see my veins struck't out being overheated with my blood boiling in wrath i'll tame you
and once more fill a kingdom's throne
spain i'll new mould thee i will have a chair made all of dead men's bones and the ascents shall be the heads of spaniards set in ranks i will have philip's head hortenzo's head mendoza's head thy mother's head and this this head that is so cross i'll have't
the scene wants actors i'll fetch more and clothe it in rich cothurnal pomp a tragedy ought to be grave graves this shall beautify
moor execute to th' life my dread commands vengeance awake thou hast much work in hand
i am weary of this office and this life it is too thirsty and i would your blood might 'scape the filling out
by heaven i swear i scorn these blows and his rebukes to bear
o zarack pity me i love thee well love deserves pity pity isabel
what would you have me do
to kill this moor
i'll cast an eye of death upon my face i'll be no more his slave
swear to advance me and by yon setting sun this hand and this shall rid you of a tyrant
by my birth no spaniard's honour'd place shall equal thine
i'll kill him then
i pray thee first fetch philip and hortenzo out of that hell they two will be most glad to aid thee in this execution
my lord philippo and hortenzo rise
your hands so talk to her at my return this sword shall reek with blood of balthazar
three curses like three commendations to their souls i send thy tortured brother does curse the cardinal the moor thy mother
curse not at all
dear souls revenge is hot and boils in zarack's brains the plot is cast into the mould of hell you freemen are zarack will kill the moor and balthazar
how can that relish
i'll tell you how i did profess ay and protested too i lov'd him well what will not sorrow do
then he profess'd ay and protested too to kill them both what will not devils do
then i profess ay and protest it too that here's for him what will not philip do
see where he comes
enter the two moors
zarack what do i see
thou art half damn'd for it i'll to my lord
i'll stop you on your way lie there thy tongue shall tell no tales to day
nor thine to morrow this revenge was well
by this time both the slaves shake hands in hell
philippo and hortenzo stand you still
what doat you both
cannot you see your play
well fare a woman then to lead the way
once rob the dead put the moors' habits on and paint your faces with the oil of hell so waiting on the tyrant come no more 'tis here and here room there below stand wide bury them well since they so godly died
away then fate now let revenge be plac'd
and here a tyrant's blood doth sweetly taste
enter and other lords
why laughs the moor
i laugh because you jest laugh at a jest
who i imprison them
i prize their lives with weights their necks with chains their hands with manacles
do i all this
because my face is in night's colour dyed think you my conscience and my soul is so
black faces may have hearts as white as snow and 'tis a general rule in moral schools the whitest faces have the blackest souls
but touching my hortenzo good old man i never touch'd him do not touch me then with thy hortenzo
and where is philip too
i pray i pray is philip a tame spaniard
what can i philip him hither hither make him fly
and where is isabel
she was with you
and where is isabel
she was with me
enter and like moors
and so are you yet are you well you see but in good time see where their keepers come
come hither zarack balthazar come hither zarack old lord alvero asks of thee where young hortenzo is
my lord set free
o is he so
come hither balthazar lord christofero here would ask of thee where prince philippo is
my lord set free
o is he so
roderigo asketh me for isabel
i say my lord she's free
o is she so
i set philippo i hortenzo free
my lords because you shall believe me too go to the castle i will follow you
thanks to the mighty moor and for his fame be more in honour than thou art in name but let me wish the other prisoners well the queen and cardinal let all have right let law absolve them or dissolve them quite
grave man thy grey hairs paint out gravity thy counsels wisdom thy wit policy
there let us meet and with a general brain erect the peace of spirit and of spain
then will spain flourish
ay when it is mine
we must part in hell
true peace of joy
manent and 'tis a dissembling knell farewell my lords meet there so ha ha ha
now tragedy thou minion of the night rhamnusia's pew fellow to thee i'll sing upon a harp made of dead spanish bones the proudest instrument the world affords when thou in crimson jollity shalt bathe thy limbs as black as mine in springs of blood still gushing from the conduit head of spain
to thee that never blushest though thy cheeks are full of blood o saint revenge to thee i consecrate my murders all my stabs my bloody labours tortures stratagems the volume of all wounds that wound from me mine is the stage thine is the tragedy
where am i now
o at the prison true
zarack and balthazar come hither see survey my library
i study ha whilst you two sleep marry 'tis villany
here's a good book zarack behold it well it's deeply written for 'twas made in hell now balthazar a better book for thee but for myself this this the best of all and therefore do i claim it every day for fear the readers steal the art away
where thou stand'st now there must hortenzo hang like tantalus in a maw eating pang
there balthazar must prince philip stand like damn'd prometheus and to act his part shall have a dagger sticking at his heart
but in my room i'll set the cardinal and he shall preach repentance to them all
damnation tickles him he laughs again
philip must stand there and bleed to death
well villain i only laugh to see that we shall live to outlaugh him and thee
o fit fit fit
stay a rare jest rare jest
zarack suppose thou art hortenzo now i pray thee stand in passion of a pang to see by thee how quaintly he would hang
i am hortenzo tut tut fear not man thou lookest like zarack
ay hortenzo he shall hang here i' faith come zarack come and balthazar take thou philippo's room first let me see you plac'd
slaves ha ha ha
you are but players that must end the play how like hortenzo and philippo
stand my two slaves were they as black as you
well zarack i'll unfix thee first of all thou shalt help me to play the cardinal this iron engine on his head i'll clap like a pope's mitre or a cardinal's cap then manacle his hands as thou dost mine so so i pray thee zarack set him free that both of you may stand and laugh at me
'tis fine i' faith call in more company alvero roderigo and the rest who will not laugh at eleazar's jest
anon anon we have not laugh'd enough it's but begun
unmanacle my hands i say
then shall we mar our mirth and spoil the play
and let me out
i thank you for that flout to let alvero in and let you out
am not i your lord the moor
and the devil of hell and more than that and eleazar too
and devil's dam what do i here with you
my tongue shall torture thee
i know thee then all women's tongues are tortures unto men
spaniards this was the villain this is he who through enticements of alluring lust and glory which makes silly women proud and men malicious did incense my spirit beyond the limits of a woman's mind to wrong myself and that lord cardinal and that which sticks more near unto my blood he that was nearest to my blood my son to dispossess him of his right by wrong o that i might embrace him on this breast which did enclose him when he first was born no greater happiness can heav'n show'r upon me than to circle in these arms of mine that son whose royal blood i did defame to crown with honour an ambitious moor
thus then thy happiness is complete embraces her
behold thy philip ransom'd from that prison in which the moor had cloistered him
then am i betrayed and cosen'd in my own designs i did contrive their ruin but their subtle policy hath blasted my ambitious thoughts
what have you done with them
they're gone to pluto's kingdom to provide a place for thee and to attend thee there
but lest they should be tired with too long expecting hopes come brave spirits of spain this is the moor the actor of these evils thus thrust him down to act among the devils
and am i thus despatch'd
had i but breath'd the space of one hour longer i would have fully acted my revenge but o now pallid death bids me prepare and haste to charon for to be his fare
i come i come but ere my glass is run i'll curse you all and cursing end my life
may'st thou lascivious queen whose damned charms bewitch'd me to the circle of thy arms unpiti'd die consum'd with loathed lust which thy venereous mind hath basely nurs'd and for you philip may your days be long but clouded with perpetual misery may thou hortenzo and thy isabel be fetch'd alive by furies into hell there to be damn'd for ever
o i faint devils come claim your right and when i am confin'd within your kingdom then shall i outact you all in perfect villany
take down his body while his blood streams forth his acts are pass'd and our last act is done
now do i challenge my hereditary right to the roy'l spanish throne usurp'd by him in which in all your sights i thus do plant myself
lord cardinal and you the queen my mother i pardon all those crimes you have committed
i'll now repose myself in peaceful rest and fly unto some solitary residence where i'll spin out the remnant of my life in true contrition for my pass'd offences
and now hortenzo to close up your wound i here contract my sister unto thee with comic joy to end a tragedy
and for the barbarous moor and his black train let all the moors be banished from spain
