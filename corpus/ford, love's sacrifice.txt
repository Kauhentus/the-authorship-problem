ACT I.
SCENE I.
Pavia: A Room in the Palace of the Duke of Pavia.
Enter Roseilli and Roderico D’Avolos.
1 Ros. Depart the court?
2
D’Av. Such was the duke's command.
4
Ros. You'ar secretary to the state and him,
6 Great in his counsels, wise, and, I think, honest.
Have you, in turning over old recórds,
8 Read but one name descended of the house
Of Lesui in his loyalty remiss?
10
D’Av. Never, my lord.
12
Ros. Why, then, should I now, now when glorious peace
14 Triumphs in change of pleasures, be wiped off,
Like to a useless moth, from courtly ease? −
16 And whither must I go?
18 D'Av. You have the open world before you.
20 Ros. Why, then 'tis like I'm banished?
22 D'Av. Not so: my warrant is only to command you
from the court, within five hours to depart after notice
24 taken, and not to live within thirty miles of it, until it
be thought meet by his excellence to call you back.
26 Now I have warned you, my lord, at your peril be it,
if you disobey. I shall inform the duke of your
28 discontent.
30 [Exit D'Avolos.]

5
32 Ros. Do, politician, do! I scent the plot
Of this disgrace; 'tis Fiormonda, she,
34 That glorious widow, whose commanding check
Ruins my love: like foolish beasts, thus they
36 Find danger that prey too near the lions' den.
38 Enter Fernando and Petruchio.
40 Ferna. My noble lord, Roseilli!
42 Ros. Sir, the joy
I should have welcomed you with is wrapt up
44 In clouds of my disgrace; yet, honoured sir,
Howsoever frowns of great ones cast me down,
46 My service shall pay tribute in my lowness
To your uprising virtues.
48
Ferna. Sir, I know
50 You are so well acquainted with your own,
You need not flatter mine: trust me, my lord,
52 I'll be a suitor for you.
54 Pet. And I'll second
My nephew's suit with importunity.
56
Ros. You are, my Lord Fernando, late returned
58 From travels; pray instruct me: − since the voice
Of most supreme authority commands
60 My absence, I determine to bestow
Some time in learning languages abroad;
62 Perhaps the change of air may change in me
Remembrance of my wrongs at home: good sir,
64 Inform me; say I meant to live in Spain,
What benefit of knowledge might I treasure?
66
Ferna. Troth, sir, I'll freely speak as I have found.
68 In Spain you lose experience; 'tis a climate
Too hot to nourish arts; the nation proud,
70 And in their pride unsociable; the court
More pliable to glorify itself
72 Than do a stranger grace: if you intend
To traffic like a merchant, 'twere a place
74 Might better much your trade; but as for me,
I soon took surfeit on it.
76
Ros. What for France?
78

6
Ferna. France I more praise and love. You are, my lord,
80 Yourself for horsemanship much famed; and there
You shall have many proofs to shew your skill.
82 The French are passing courtly, ripe of wit,
Kind, but extreme dissemblers; you shall have
84 A Frenchman ducking lower than your knee,
At th' instant mocking even your very shoe-ties.
86 To give the country due, it is on earth
A paradise; and if you can neglect
88 Your own appropriaments, but praising that
In others wherein you excel yourself,
90 You shall be much belovèd there.
92 Ros. Yet methought
I heard you and the duchess, two nights since,
94 Discoursing of an island thereabouts,
Called − let me think − 'twas −
96
Ferna. England?
98
Ros. That: pray, sir −
100 You have been there, methought I heard you praise it.
102 Ferna. I'll tell you what I found there; men as neat,
As courtly as the French, but in condition
104 Quite opposite. Put case that you, my lord,
Could be more rare on horseback than you are,
106 If there − as there are many − one excelled
You in your art as much as you do others,
108 Yet will the English think their own is nothing
Compared with you, a stranger; in their habits
110 They are not more fantastic than uncertain;
In short, their fair abundance, manhood, beauty,
112 No nation can disparage but itself.
114 Ros. My lord, you have much eased me; I resolve.
116 Ferna. And whither are you bent?
118 Ros. My lord, for travel;
To speed for England.
120
Ferna. No, my lord, you must not:
122 I have yet some private conference
To impart unto you for your good; at night
124 I'll meet you at my Lord Petruchio's house:
Till then be secret.
126

7
Ros. Dares my cousin trust me?
128
Pet. Dare I, my lord! yes, 'less your fact were greater
130 Than a bold woman's spleen.
132 Ros. The duke's at hand,
And I must hence: my service to your lordships.
134
[Exit Roseilli.]
136
Pet. Now, nephew, as I told you, since the duke
138 Hath held the reins of state in his own hand,
Much altered from the man he was before, −
140 ………
As if he were transformèd in his mind, −
142 To soothe him in his pleasures, amongst whom
Is fond Ferentes; one whose pride takes pride
144 In nothing more than to delight his lust;
And he − with grief I speak it − hath, I fear,
146 Too much besotted my unhappy daughter,
My poor Colona; whom, for kindred's sake,
148 As you are noble, as you honour virtue,
Persuade to love herself: a word from you
150 May win her more than my entreaties or frowns.
152 Ferna. Uncle, I'll do my best: meantime, pray tell me,
Whose mediation wrought the marriäge
154 Betwixt the duke and duchess? who was agent?
156 Pet. His roving eye and her enchanting face,
The only dower nature had ordained
158 T' advance her to her bride-bed. She was daughter
Unto a gentleman of Milan − no better −
160 Preferred to serve in the Duke of Mílan's court;
Where for her beauty she was greatly famed:
162 And passing late from thence to Monaco
To visit there her uncle, Paul Baglione
164 The Abbot, Fortune − queen to such blind matches −
Presents her to the duke's eye, on the way,
166 As he pursues the deer: in short, my lord,
He saw her, loved her, wooed her, won her, matched her;
168 No counsel could divert him.
170 Ferna. She is fair.
172 Pet. She is; and, to speak truth, I think right noble
In her conditions.
174

8
Ferna. If, when I should choose,
176 Beauty and virtue were the fee proposed,
I should not pass for parentage.
178
Pet. The duke
180 Doth come.
182 Ferna. Let's break-off talk. − [Aside] If ever, now,
Good angel of my soul, protect my truth!
184
Enter the Duke, Bianca, Fiormonda, Nibrassa,
186 Ferentes, Julia, and D’Avolos.
188 Duke. Come, my Bianca, revel in mine arms;
Whiles I, rapt in my admiration, view
190 Lilies and roses growing in thy cheeks. −
Fernando! O, thou half myself! no joy
192 Could make my pleasures full without thy presence:
I am a monarch of felicity,
194 Proud in a pair of jewëls, rich and beautiful, −
A perfect friend, a wife above compare.
196
Ferna. Sir, if a man so low in rank may hope,
198 By loyal duty and devoted zeal,
To hold a correspondency in friendship
200 With one so mighty as the Duke of Pavy,
My uttermost ambition is to climb
202 To those deserts may give the style of servant.
204 Duke. Of partner in my dukedom, in my heart,
As freely as the privilege of blood
206 Hath made them mine; Philippo and Fernando
Shall be without distinction. − Look, Bianca,
208 On this good man; in all respects to him
Be as to me: only the name of husband,
210 And reverent observance of our bed,
Shall differ us in persons, else in soul
212 We are all one.
214 Bian. I shall in best of love
Regard the bosom-partner of my lord.
216
Fiorm. [Aside to Ferentes] Ferentes, −
218
Feren. [Aside to Fiormonda] Madam?
220
Fiorm. [Aside to Ferentes] You are one loves courtship;
222 He had some change of words: 'twere no lost labour 

9
To stuff your table-books; the man speaks wisely!
224
Feren. [Aside to Fiormonda]
226 I'm glad your highness is so pleasant.
228 Duke. Sister, −
230 Fiorm. My lord and brother?
232 Duke. You are too silent,
Quicken your sad remembrance: though the loss
234 Of your dead husband be of more account
Than slight neglect, yet 'tis a sin against
236 The state of princes to exceed a mean
In mourning for the dead.
238
Fiorm. Should form, my lord,
240 Prevail above affection? no, it cannot.
You have yourself here a right noble duchess,
242 Virtuous at least; and should your grace now pay −
Which Heaven forbid! − the debt you owe to nature,
244 I dare presume she'd not so soon forget
A prince that thus advanced her. − Madam, could you?
246
D’Av. [Aside] Bitter and shrewd.
248
Bian. [To Fiornonda]
Sister, I should too much bewray my weakness,
250 To give a resolution on a passion
I never felt nor feared.
252
Nib. A modest answer.
254
Ferna. If credit may be given to a face,
256 My lord, I'll undertake on her behalf;
Her words are trusty heralds to her mind.
258
Fiorm. [Aside to D’Avolos]
260 Exceeding good; the man will "undertake"!
Observe it, D'Avolos.
262
D’Av. [Aside to Fiormonda] I do, lady;
264 'Tis a smooth praise.
266 Duke. Friend, in thy judgment I approve thy love,
And love thee better for thy judging mine.
268 Though my gray-headed senate in the laws
Of strict opinion and severe dispute 

10
270 Would tie the limits of our free affects, −
Like superstitious Jews, − to match with none
272 But in a tribe of princes like ourselves, −
Gross-nurtured slaves, who force their wretched souls
274 To crouch to profit; nay, for trash and wealth
Dote on some crooked or misshapen form;
276 Hugging wise Nature's lame deformity,
Begetting creatures ugly as themselves: −
278 But why should princes do so, that command
The storehouse of the earth's hid minerals? −
280 No, my Bianca, thou art to me as dear
As if thy portion had been Europe's riches;
282 Since in thine eyes lies more than these are worth. −
Set on; they shall be strangers to my heart
284 That envy thee thy fortunes. − Come, Fernando,
My but divided self; what we have done
286 We are only debtor to Heaven for. − On!
288 Fiorm. [Aside to D'Avolos]
Now take thy time, or never, D'Avolos;
290 Prevail, and I will raise thee high in grace.
292 D’Av. [Aside to Fiormonda] Madam, I will omit no art.
294 [Exeunt all but D’Avolos, who stays Fernando.]
296 My honoured Lord Fernando!
298 Ferna. To me, sir?
300 D’Av. Let me beseech your lordship to excuse me,
in the nobleness of your wisdom, if I exceed good
302 manners: I am one, my lord, who in the admiration
of your perfect virtues do so truly honour and
304 reverence your deserts, that there is not a creature
bears life shall more faithfully study to do you
306 service in all offices of duty and vows of due respect.
308 Ferna. Good sir, you bind me to you: is this all?
310 D’Av. I beseech your ear a little; good my lord, what
I have to speak concerns your reputation and best
312 fortune.
314 Ferna. How's that! my reputation? lay aside
Superfluous ceremony; speak; what is't?
316
D’Av. I do repute myself the blessedest man alive,
318 that I shall be the first gives your lordship news of 

11
your perpetual comfort.
320
Ferna. As how?
322
D'Av. If singular beauty, unimitable virtues, honour,
324 youth, and absolute goodness be a fortune, all those
are at once offered to your particular choice.
326
Ferna. Without delays, which way?
328
D'Av. The great and gracious Lady Fiormonda love[s]
330 you, infinitely loves you. − But, my lord, as ever you
tendered a servant to your pleasures, let me not be
332 revealed that I gave you notice on't.
334 Ferna. Sure, you are strangely out of tune, sir.
336 D’Av. Please but to speak to her; be but courtlyceremonious with her, use once but the language of
338 affection − if I misreport aught besides my knowledge,
let me never have place in your good opinion. O, these
340 women, my lord, are as brittle metal as your glasses,
as smooth, as slippery, − their very first substance
342 was quicksands: let 'em look never so demurely,
one fillip chokes them. My lord, she loves you; I know
344 it. − But I beseech your lordship not to discover me;
I would not for the world she should know that you
346 know it by me.
348 Ferna. I understand you, and to thank your care
Will study to requite it; and I vow
350 She never shall have notice of your news
By me or by my means. And, worthy sir,
352 Let me alike enjoin you not to speak
A word of that I understand her love;
354 And as for me, my word shall be your surety
I'll not as much as give her cause to think
356 I ever heard it.
358 D'Av. Nay, my lord, whatsoever I infer, you may
break with her in it, if you please; for, rather than
360 silence should hinder you one step to such a
fortune, I will expose myself to any rebuke for
362 your sake, my good lord.
364 Ferna. You shall not indeed, sir; I am still your
friend, and will prove so. For the present I am
366 forced to attend the duke: good hours befall ye! 

12
I must leave you.
368
[Exit Fernando.]
370
D’Av. Gone already? 'sfoot, I ha' marred all! this is
372 worse and worse; he's as cold as hemlock. If her
highness knows how I have gone to work, she'll thank
374 me scurvily: a pox of all dull brains! I took the clean
contrary course. There is a mystery in this slight
376 carelessness of his; I must sift it, and I will find it.
Ud's me, fool myself out of my wit! well, I'll choose
378 some fitter opportunity to inveigle him, and till then
smooth her up that he is a man overjoyed with the
380 report.
382 [Exit.]

13
ACT I, SCENE II.
Another Room in the Palace.
Enter Ferentes and Colona.
1 Feren. Madam, by this light I vow myself your servant,
2 only yours, inespecially yours. Time, like a turncoat,
may order and disorder the outward fashions of our
4 bodies, but shall never enforce a change on the
constancy of my mind. Sweet Colona, fair Colona,
6 young and sprightful lady, do not let me, in the best
of my youth, languish in my earnest affections.
8
Col. Why should you seek, my lord, to purchase glory
10 By the disgrace of a silly maid?
12 Feren. That I confess too. I am every way so unworthy
of the first-fruits of thy embraces, so far beneath
14 the riches of thy merit, that it can be no honour to thy
fame to rank me in the number of thy servants; yet
16 prove me how true, how firm I will stand to thy
pleasures, to thy command; and, as time shall serve,
18 be ever thine. Now, prithee, dear Colona, −
20 Col. Well, well, my lord, I have no heart of flint;
Or if I had, you know by cunning words
22 How to outwear it: − but −
24 Feren. But what? do not pity thy own gentleness,
lovely Colona. Shall I speak? shall I? − say but "ay",
26 and our wishes are made up.
28 Col. How shall I say "ay", when my fears say "no"?
30 Feren. You will not fail to meet [me] two hours
hence, sweet?
32
Col. No; −
34 Yes, yes, I would have said: how my tongue trips!
36 Feren. I take that promise and that double "yes" as
an assurance of thy faith. In the grove; good sweet,
38 remember; in any case alone, − d'ee mark, love? –
not as much as your duchess' little dog; − you'll not
40 forget? − two hours hence − think on't, and miss
not: till then −
42
Col. O, if you should prove false, and love another! 

14
44
Feren. Defy me, then! I'll be all thine, and a servant
46 only to thee, only to thee.
48 [Exit Colona.]
50 − Very passing good! three honest women in our
courts here of Italy are enough to discredit a whole
52 nation of that sex. He that is not a cuckold or a
bastard is a strangely happy man; for a chaste wife,
54 or a mother that never stepped awry, are wonders,
wonders in Italy. 'Slife! I have got the feat on't, and
56 am every day more active in my trade: 'tis a sweet
sin, this slip of mortality, and I have tasted enough
58 for one passion of my senses. − Here comes more
work for me.
60
Enter Julia.
62
And how does my own Julia? Mew upon this sadness!
64 what's the matter, you are melancholy? − Whither away,
wench?
66
Jul. 'Tis well; the time has been when your smooth tongue
68 Would not have mocked my griefs; and had I been
More chary of mine honour, you had still
70 Been lowly as you were.
72 Feren. Lowly! why, I am sure I cannot be much more
lowly than I am to thee; thou bring'st me on my
74 bare knees, wench, twice in every four-and-twenty
hours, besides half-turns instead of bevers. What must
76 we next do, sweetheart?
78 Jul. Break vows on your side; I expect no other,
But every day look when some newer choice
80 May violate your honour and my trust.
82 Feren. Indeed, forsooth! how shay by that, la? I hope
I neglect no opportunity to your nunquam satis, to
84 be called in question for. Go, thou art as fretting
as an old grogram: by this hand, I love thee for't;
86 it becomes thee so prettily to be angry. Well, if thou
shouldst die, farewell all love with me forever! go;
88 I'll meet thee soon in thy lady's back-lobby, I will,
wench; look for me.
90
Jul. But shall I be resolved you will be mine?
92

15
Feren. All thine; I will reserve my best ability, my
94 heart, my honour only to thee, only to thee. − Pity of
my blood, away! I hear company coming on: remember,
96 soon I am all thine, I will live perpetually only to thee:
away!
98
[Exit Julia.]
100
S'foot! I wonder about what time of the year I was
102 begot; sure, it was when the moon was in conjunction,
and all the other planets drunk at a morris-dance:
104 I am haunted above patience; my mind is not as
infinite to do as my occasions are proffered of doing.
106 − "Chastity"! I am an eunuch if I think there be any
such thing; or if there be, 'tis amongst us men, for I
108 never found it in a woman throughly tempted yet. I
have a shrewd hard task coming on; but let it pass. −
110 Who comes now? My lord, the duke's friend! I will
strive to be inward with him.
112
Enter Fernando.
114
My noble Lord Fernando! −
116
Ferna. My Lord Ferentes, I should change some words
118 Of consequence with you; but since I am,
For this time, busied in more serious thoughts,
120 I'll pick some fitter opportunity.
122 Feren. I will wait your pleasure, my lord. Good-day
to your lordship.
124
[Exit Ferentes.]
126
Ferna. Traitor to friendship! − whither shall I run,
128 That, lost to reason, cannot sway the float
Of the unruly faction in my blood?
130 The duchess, Oh, the duchess! in her smiles
Are all my joys abstracted. − Death to my thoughts!
132 My other plague comes to me.
134 Enter Fiormonda and Julia.
136 Fiorm. My Lord Fernando, what, so hard at study!
You are a kind companion to yourself,
138 That love to be alone so.
140 Ferna. Madam, no; 

16
I rather chose this leisure to admire
142 The glories of this little world, the court,
Where, like so many stars, on several thrones
144 Beauty and greatness shine in proper orbs;
Sweet matter for my meditatiön.
146
Fiorm. So, so, sir! − Leave us, Julia,
148
[Exit Julia.]
150
 − your own proof,
152 By travel and prompt observatiön,
Instruct you how to place the use of speech. −
154 But since you are at leisure, pray let's sit:
We'll pass the time a little in discourse.
156 What have you seen abroad?
158 Ferna. No wonders, lady,
Like these I see at home.
160
Fiorm. "At home!" as how?
162
Ferna. Your pardon, if my tongue, the voice of truth,
164 Report but what is warranted by sight.
166 Fiorm. What sight?
168 Ferna. Look in your glass, and you shall see
A miracle.
170
Fiorm. What miracle?
172
Ferna. Your beauty,
174 So far above all beauties else abroad
As you are in your own superlative.
176
Fiorm. Fie, fie! your wit hath too much edge.
178
Ferna. Would that,
180 Or any thing that I could challenge mine,
Were but of value to express how much
182 I serve in love the sister of my prince!
184 Fiorm. 'Tis for your prince's sake, then, not for mine?
186 Ferna. For you in him, and much for him in you.
I must acknowledge, madam, I observe
188 In your affects a thing to me most strange,
Which makes me so much honour you the more. 

17
190
Fiorm. Pray, tell it.
192
Ferna. Gladly, lady:
194 I see how, opposite to youth and custom,
You set before you, in the tablature
196 Of your remembrance, the becoming griefs
Of a most loyal lady, for the loss
198 Of so renowned a prince as was your lord.
200 Fiorm. Now, good my lord, no more of him.
202 Ferna. "Of him"!
I know it is a needless task in me
204 To set him forth in his deservèd praise;
You better can record it; for you find
206 How much more he exceeded other men
In most heroic virtues of account,
208 So much more was your loss in losing him.
"Of him"! his praise should be a field too large,
210 Too spacious, for so mean an orator
As I to range in.
212
Fiorm. Sir, enough: 'tis true
214 He well deserved your labour. On his deathbed
This ring he gave me, bade me never part
216 With this but to the man I loved as dearly
As I loved him: yet since you know which way
218 To blaze his worth so rightly, in return
To your deserts, wear this for him and me.
220
[Offers him the ring.]
222
Ferna. Madam!
224
Fiorm. ‘Tis yours,
226
Ferna. Methought you said he charged you
228 Not to impart it but to him you loved
As dearly as you loved him.
230
Fiorm. True, I said so,
232
Ferna. O, then, far be it my unhallowed hand
234 With any rude intrusion should annul
A testament enacted by the dead!
236
Fiorm. Why, man, that testament is disannulled 

18
238 And cancelled quite by us that live. Look here,
My blood is not yet freezed; for better instance,
240 Be judge yourself; experience is no danger −
Cold are my sighs; but, feel, my lips are warm.
242
[Kisses him.]
244
Ferna. What means the virtuous marquess?
246
Fiorm. To new-kiss
248 The oath to thee, which whiles he lived was his:
Hast thou yet power to love?
250
Ferna. "To love!"
252
Fiorm. To meet
254 Sweetness of language in discourse as sweet?
256 Ferna. Madam, 'twere dulness past the ignorance
Of common blockheads not to understand
258 Whereto this favour tends; and 'tis a fortune
So much above my fate, that I could wish
260 No greater happiness on earth: but know,
Long since I vowed to live a single life.
262
Fiorm. What was't you said?
264
Ferna. I said I made a vow −
266
Enter Bianca, Petruchio, Colona, and D'Avolos.
268
[Aside] Blessèd deliverance!
270
Fiorm. [Aside] Prevented? mischief on this interruption!
272
Bian. My Lord Fernando, you encounter fitly;
274 I have a suit t'ee.
276 Ferna. 'Tis my duty, madam,
To be commanded.
278
Bian. Since my lord the duke
280 Is now disposed to mirth, the time serves well
For mediation, that he would be pleased
282 To take the Lord Roseilli to his grace.
He is a noble gentleman; I dare
284 Engage my credit, loyal to the state; −
[To Fiormonda] And, sister, one that ever strove, methought, 

19
286 By special service and obsequious care,
To win respect from you: it were a part
288 Of gracious favour, if you pleased to join
With us in being suitors to the duke
290 For his return to court.
292 Fiorm. "To court!" indeed,
You have some cause to speak; he undertook,
294 Most champion-like, to win the prize at tilt,
In honour of your picture; marry, did he.
296 There's not a groom o' the querry could have matched
The jolly riding-man: pray, get him back;
298 I do not need his service, madam, I.
300 Bian. Not need it, sister? why, I hope you think
'Tis no necessity in me to move it,
302 More than respect of honour.
304 Fiorm. Honour! puh!
Honour is talked of more than known by some.
306
Bian. Sister, these words I understand not.
308
Ferna. [Aside] Swell not, unruly thoughts! −
310 [To Bianca] Madam, the motion you propose proceeds
From the true touch of goodness; 'tis a plea
312 Wherein my tongue and knee shall jointly strive
To beg his highness for Roseilli's cause.
314 Your judgment rightly speaks him; there is not
In any court of Christendom a man
316 For quality or trust more absolute.
318 Fiorm. [Aside] How! is't even so?
320 Pet. I shall forever bless
Your highness for your gracious kind esteem
322 Of my disheartened kinsman; and to add
Encouragement to what you undertake,
324 I dare affirm ‘tis no important fault
Hath caused the duke’s distaste.
326
Bian. I hope so too.
328
D’Av. Let your highness, and you all, my lords, take
330 advice how you motion his excellency on Roseilli's
behalf; there is more danger in that man than is fit
332 to be publicly reported. I could wish things were
otherwise for his own sake; but I'll assure ye, you 

20
334 will exceedingly alter his excellency's disposition he
now is in, if you but mention the name of Roseilli to
336 his ear; I am so much acquainted in the process of
his actions.
338
Bian. If it be so, I am the sorrier, sir:
340 I'm loth to move my lord unto offence;
Yet I'll adventure chiding.
342
Ferna. [Aside] Oh, had I India's gold, I'd give it all
344 T' exchange one private word, one minute's breath,
With this heart-wounding beauty!
346
Enter the Duke, Ferentes, and Nibrassa.
348
Duke. Prithee, no more, Ferentes; by the faith
350 I owe to honour, thou hast made me laugh
Beside my spleen. − Fernando, hadst thou heard
352 The pleasant humour of Mauruccio's dotage
Discoursed, how in the winter of his age
354 He is become a lover, thou wouldst swear
A morris-dance were but a tragedy
356 Compared to that: well, we will see the youth. −
What council hold you now, sirs?
358
Bian. We, my lord,
360 Were talking of the horsemanship in France,
Which, as your friend reports, he thinks exceeds
362 All other nations.
364 Duke. How! why, have not we
As gallant riders here?
366
Ferna. None that I know.
368
Duke. Pish, your affection leads you; I dare wage
370 A thousand ducats, not a man in France
Outrides Roseilli.
372
Fiorm. [Aside] I shall quit this wrong.
374
Bian. I said as much, my lord.
376
Ferna. I have not seen
378 His practice since my coming back.
380 Duke. Where is he?
How is't we see him not? 

21
382
Pet. [Aside] What's this? what's this?
384
Ferna. I hear he was commanded from the court.
386
D’Av. [Aside] O, confusion on this villainous
388 occasion!
390 Duke. True; but we meant a day or two at most
Should be his furthest term. Not yet returned? −
392 Where's D'Avolos?
394 D’Av. [Advancing] My lord?
396 Duke. You know our mind:
How comes it thus to pass we miss Roseilli?
398
D’Av. My lord, in a sudden discontent I hear he
400 departed towards Benevento, determining, as I
am given to understand, to pass to Seville, minding
402 to visit his cousin, Don Pedro de Toledo, in the
Spanish court.
404
Duke. The Spanish court! now by the blessèd bones
406 Of good Saint Francis, let there posts be sent
To call him back, or I will post thy head
408 Beneath my foot: − ha, you! you know my mind;
Look that you get him back: the Spanish court!
410 And without our commission! − Say!
412 Pet. [Aside] Here's fine juggling!
414 Bian. Good sir, be not so moved.
416 Duke. Fie, fie, Bianca,
Tis such a gross indignity; I'd rather
418 Have lost seven years' revenue: − the Spanish court! −
How now, what ails our sister?
420
Fiorm. On the sudden
422 I fall a-bleeding; 'tis an ominous sign,
Pray Heaven it turn to good! − Your highness' leave.
424
[Exit Fiormonda.]
426
Duke. Look to her. − Come, Fernando; − come, Bianca, −
428 Let's strive to overpass this choleric heat. −
[To D'Avolos] Sirrah, see that you trifle not. − How we
430 Who sway the manage by authority 

22
May be abused by smooth officious agents! −
432 But look well to our sister.
434 [Exeunt all but Petruchio and Fernando.]
436 Pet. Nephew, please you
To see your friend to-night?
438
Ferna. Yes, uncle, yes.
440
[Exit Petruchio.]
442
Thus bodies walk unsouled! mine eyes but follows
444 My heart entombed in yonder goodly shrine:
Life without her is but death's subtle snares,
446 And I am but a coffin to my cares.
448 [Exit.]

23
ACT II.
SCENE I.
A Room in Mauruccio's House.
Mauruccio looking in a glass, trimming his beard;
Giacopo brushing him.
1 Maur. Beard, be confined to neatness, that no hair
2 May stover up to prick my mistress' lip,
 More rude than bristles of a porcupine. −
4 Giacopo!
6 Gia. My lord?
8 Maur. Am I all sweet behind?
10 Gia. I have no poulterer's nose; but your apparel sits
about you most debonairly.
12
Maur. But, Giacopo, with what grace do my words
14 proceed out of my mouth? Have I a moving
countenance? is there harmony in my voice?
16 canst thou perceive, as it were, a handsomeness
of shape in my very breath, as it is formed into
18 syllable[s], Giacopo?
20 Enter above Duke, Bianca, Fiormonda, Fernando,
Courtiers, and Attendants.
22
Gia. Yes, indeed, sir, I do feel a savour as pleasant as −
24 [Aside] a glister-pipe − calamus, or civet.
26 Duke. Observe him, and be silent.
28 Maur. Hold thou the glass, Giacopo, and mark me
with what exceeding comeliness I could court the lady
30 marquess, if it come to the push.
32 Duke. Sister, you are his aim.
34 Fiorm. A subject fit
To be the stale of laughter!
36
Bian. That's your music.
38
Maur. Thus I reverse my pace, and thus stalkingly
40 in courtly gait, I advance one, two, and three. − 

24
Good! I kiss my hand, make my congee, settle my
42 countenance, and thus begin. − Hold up the glass
higher, Giacopo.
44
Gia. Thus high, sir?
46
Maur. 'Tis well; now mark me:
48
 Most excellent marquéss, most fair la-dý,
50 Let not old age or hairs that are sil-vér
 Disparage my desire; for it may be
52 I am than other green youth nimble-ér.
 Since I am your gra−cé’s servánt so true,
54 Great lady, then, love me for my vir-túe.”
56 O, Giacopo, Petrarch was a dunce, Dante a jig-maker,
Sanazzar a goose, and Ariosto a puck-fist to me! I
58 tell thee, Giacopo, I am rapt with fury; and have
been for these six nights together drunk with the
60 pure liquor of Helicon.
62 Gia. I think no less, sir; for you look as wild, and
talk as idly, as if you had not slept these nine years.
64
Duke. What think you of this language, sister?
66
Fiorm. Sir,
68 I think, in princes' courts, no age nor greatness
But must admit the fool; in me 'twere folly
70 To scorn what greater states than I have been.
72 Bian. O, but you are too general −
74 Fiorm. A fool!
I thank your highness: many a woman's wit
76 Have thought themselves much better was much worse.
78 Bian. You still mistake me.
80 Duke. Silence! note the rest.
82 Maur. God-a-mercy, brains! − Giacopo, I have it!
84 Gia. What, my lord?
86 Maur. A conceit, Giacopo, and a fine one − down on
thy knees, Giacopo, and worship my wit. Give me
88 both thy ears. Thus it is: I will have my picture
drawn most composituously, in a square table of
90 some two foot long, from the crown of the head to 

25
the waist downward, no further.
92
Gia. Then you'll look like a dwarf, sir, being cut off
94 by the middle.
96 Maur. Speak not thou, but wonder at the conceit that
follows: in my bosom, on my left side, I will have a
98 leaf of blood-red crimson velvet − as it were part of
my doublet − open; which being opened, Giacopo, −
100 now mark! − I will have a clear and most transparent
crystal in the form of a heart. − Singular-admirable! –
102 When I have framed this, I will, as some rare
outlandish piece of workmanship, bestow it on the
104 most fair and illustrious Lady Fiormonda.
106 Gia. But now, sir, for the conceit.
108 Maur. Simplicity and ignorance, prate no more!
blockhead, dost not understand yet? Why, this being
110 to her instead of a looking-glass, she shall no oftener
powder her hair, surfle her cheeks, cleanse her teeth,
112 or conform the hairs of her eyebrows, but having
occasion to use this glass − which for the rareness
114 and richness of it she will hourly do − but she shall
as often gaze on my picture, remember me, and
116 behold the excellence of her excellency's beauty
in the prospective and mirror, as it were, in my heart.
118
Gia. Ay, marry, sir, this is something.
120
All above except Fiorm. Ha, ha, ha!
122
[Exit Fiormonda.]
124
Bian. My sister's gone in anger.
126
Maur. Who's that laughs? search with thine eyes,
128 Giacopo.
130 Gia. O, my lord, my lord, you have gotten an
everlasting fame! the duke's grace, and the duchess'
132 grace, and my Lord Fernando's grace, with all the
rabble of courtiers, have heard every word; look
134 where they stand! Now you shall be made a count
for your wit, and I lord for my counsel.
136
Duke. Beshrew the chance! we are discoverèd.
138

26
Maur. Pity − O, my wisdom! I must speak to them. −
140 O, duke most great, and most renowèd duchess!
 Excuse my apprehensiön, which not much is;
142 'Tis love, my lord, that's all the hurt you see;
 Angelica herself shall plead for me.
144
Duke. We pardon you, most wise and learnèd lord;
146 And, that we may all glorify your wit,
Entreat your wisdom's company to-day
148 To grace our talk with your grave discourse:
What says your mighty eloquence?
150
Maur. Giacopo, help me; his grace has put me
152 out of my own bias, and I know not what to answer
in form.
154
Gia. Ud's me, tell him you'll come.
156
Maur. Yes, I will come, my lord the duke, I will.
158
Duke. We take your word, and wish your honour health. −
160 Away, then! come, Bianca, we have found
A salve for melancholy, − mirth and ease.
162
[Exit the Duke followed by all
164 but Bianca and Fernando.]
166 Bian. I'll see the jolly lover and his glass
Take leave of one another.
168
Maur. Are they gone?
170
Gia. O, my lord, I do now smell news.
172
Maur. What news, Giacopo?
174
Gia. The duke has a smackering towards you, and
176 you shall clap-up with his sister the widow suddenly.
178 Maur. She is mine, Giacopo, she is mine! Advance
the glass, Giacopo, that I may practise, as I pass, to
180 walk a portly grace like a marquesse, to which degree
I am now a-climbing.
182 Thus do we march to honour's haven of bliss,
 To ride in triumph through Persepolis.
184
[Exit Giacopo, going backward with the glass,
186 followed by Mauruccio complimenting.]

27
188 Bian. Now, as I live, here's laughter worthy our
presence! I will not lose him so.
190
[Going.]
192
Ferna. Madam, −
194
Bian. To me, my lord?
196
Ferna. Please but to hear
198 The story of a castaway in love;
And, O, let not the passage of a jest
200 Make slight a sadder subject, who hath placed
All happiness in your diviner eyes!
202
Bian. My lord, the time −
204
Ferna. "The time!" yet hear me speak,
206 For I must speak or burst: I have a soul
So anchored down with cares in seas of woe,
208 That passion and the vows I owe to you
Have changed me to a lean anatomy:
210 Sweet princess of my life, −
212 Bian. Forbear, or I shall −
214 Ferna. Yet, as you honour virtue, do not freeze
My hopes to more discomfort than as yet
216 My fears suggest; no beauty so adorns
The composition of a well-built mind
218 As pity: hear me out.
220 Bian. No more! I spare
To tell you what you are, and must confess
222 Do almost hate my judgment, that it once
Thought goodness dwelt in you. Remember now,
224 It is the third time since your treacherous tongue
Hath pleaded treason to my ear and fame;
226 Yet, for the friendship 'twixt my lord and you,
I have not voiced your follies: if you dare
228 To speak a fourth time, you shall rue your lust;
'Tis all no better: − learn and love yourself.
230
[Exit Bianca.]
232
Ferna. Gone! Oh, my sorrows! how am I undone!
234 Not speak again? no, no, in her chaste breast 

28
Virtue and resolution have discharged
236 All female weakness: I have sued and sued,
Kneeled, wept, and begged; but tears and vows and words
238 Move her no more than summer-winds a rock.
I must resolve to check this rage of blood,
240 And will: she is all icy to my fires,
Yet even that ice inflames in me desires.
242
[Exit.]

29
ACT II, SCENE II.
A Room in Petruchio's House.
Enter Petruchio and Roseilli.
1 Ros. Is't possible the duke should be so moved?
2
Pet. 'Tis true; you have no enemy at court
4 But her for whom you pine so much in love;
Then master your affections: I am sorry
6 You hug your ruin so. −
What say you to the project I proposed?
8
Ros. I entertain it with a greater joy
10 Than shame can check.
12 Enter Fernando.
14 Pet. You are come as I could wish;
My cousin is resolved.
16
Ferna. Without delay
18 Prepare yourself, and meet at court anon,
Some half-hour hence; and Cupid bless your joy!
20
Ros. If ever man was bounden to a friend, −
22
Ferna. No more; away!
24
[Exeunt Petruchio and Roseilli.]
26
 Love's rage is yet unknown;
28 In his − ay me! − too well I feel my own! −
So, now I am alone; now let me think:
30 She is the duchess; say she be; a creature
Sewed-up in painted cloth might so be styled;
32 That's but a name: she's married too; she is,
And therefore better might distinguish love:
34 She's young and fair; − why, madam, that's the bait
Invites me more to hope; she's the duke's wife:
36 Who knows not this? − she's bosomed to my friend;
There, there, I am quite lost: will not be won;
38 Still worse and worse: abhors to hear me speak;
Eternal mischief! I must urge no more;
40 For, were I not be-lepered in my soul,
Here were enough to quench the flames of hell.
42 What then? pish! [if] I must not speak, I'll write. −

30
Come, then, sad secretary to my plaints,
44 Plead thou my faith, for words are turned to sighs.
What says this paper?
46
[Takes out a letter, and reads.]
48
Enter D’Avolos behind with two pictures.
50
D’Av. [Aside] Now is the time. − Alone? reading a
52 letter? good; how now! striking his breast! what,
in the name of policy, should this mean? tearing
54 his hair! − passion! by all the hopes of my life,
plain passion! now I perceive it. If this be not
56 a fit of some violent affection, I am an ass in
understanding; why, 'tis plain, − plainer and
58 plainer; love in the extremest. Oh, for the party!
who, now? The greatness of his spirits is too high
60 cherished to be caught with some ordinary stuff,
and if it be my Lady Fiormonda, I am strangely
62 mistook. Well, that I have fit occasion soon to
understand. I have here two pictures newly drawn,
64 to be sent for a present to the Abbot of Monaco,
the duchess' uncle, her own and my lady's: I'll
66 observe which of these may, perhaps, bewray
him − 'a turns about. − My noble lord! −
68
Ferna. Y'are welcome, sir; I thank you.
70
D’Av. Me, my lord! for what, my lord?
72
Ferna. Who's there? I cry you mercy, D'Avolos,
74 I took you for another; pray, excuse me.
What is't you bear there?
76
D'Av. No secret, my lord, but may be imparted to
78 you: a couple of pictures, my good lord, − please
you see them?
80
Ferna. I care not much for pictures; but whose are they?
82
D’Av. The one is for my lord's sister, the other is the
84 duchess.
86 Ferna. Ha, D'Avolos! the duchess's?
88 D’Av. Yes, my lord. − [Aside] Sure, the word startled
him: observe that.
90

31
Ferna. You told me, Master Secretary, once,
92 You owed me love.
94 D’Av. Service, my honoured lord; howsoever you
please to term it.
96
Ferna. 'Twere rudeness to be suitor for a sight;
98 Yet trust me, sir, I'll be all secret.
100 D’Av. I beseech your lordship; − they are, as I am,
constant to your pleasure.
102
[Shows Fiormonda's picture.]
104
This, my lord, is the widow marquess's, as it now
106 newly came from the picture-drawer's, the oil yet
green: a sweet picture; and, in my judgment, art
108 hath not been a niggard in striving to equal the
life. Michael Angelo himself needed not blush
110 to own the workmanship.
112 Ferna. A very pretty picture; but, kind signior,
To whose use is it?
114
D’Av. For the duke's, my lord, who determines to
116 send it with all speed as a present to Paul Baglione,
uncle to the duchess, that he may see the riches of
118 two such lustres as shine in the court of Pavy.
120 Ferna. Pray, sir, the other?
122 D’Av. [Shows Bianca's picture.] This, my lord, is
for the duchess Bianca: a wondrous sweet picture,
124 if you well observe with what singularity the
artsman hath strove to set forth each limb in
126 exquisitest proportion, not missing a hair.
128 Ferna. A hair!
130 D’Av. She cannot more formally, or − if it may be
lawful to use the word more really, − behold her
132 own symmetry in her glass than in taking a sensible
view of this counterfeit. When I first saw it, I verily
134 almost was of a mind that this was her very lip.
136 Ferna. Lip!
138 D’Av. [Aside] How constantly he dwells upon this
portraiture! − Nay, I'll assure your lordship there is
140 no defect of cunning − [Aside] His eye is fixed as if 

32
it were incorporated there. − Were not the party
142 herself alive to witness that there is a creature
composed of flesh and blood as naturally enriched
144 with such harmony of admiral beauty as is here
artificially counterfeited, a very curious eye might
146 repute it as an imaginary rapture of some
transported conceit, to aim at an impossibility;
148 whose very first gaze is of force almost to persuade
a substantial love in a settled heart.
150
Ferna. Love! heart!
152
D’Av. My honoured lord, −
154
Ferna. Oh Heavens!
156
D’Av. [Aside] I am confirmed. − What ails your
158 lordship?
160 Ferna. You need not praise it, sir; itself is praise. −
[Aside] How near had I forgot myself! − I thank you.
162 'Tis such a picture as might well become
The shrine of some faned Venus; I am dazzled
164 With looking on't: − pray, sir, convey it hence.
166 D'Av. I am all your servant. − [Aside] Blessed,
blessed discovery! − Please you to command me?
168
Ferna. No, gentle sir. −
 [Aside] I'm lost beyond my senses. −
170 D'ee hear, sir? good, where dwells the picture-maker?
172 D'Av. By the castle's farther drawbridge, near
Galiazzo's statue; his name is Alphonso Trinultio. –
174 [Aside] Happy above all fate!
176 Ferna. You say enough; my thanks t'ee!
178 [Exit D’Avolos.]
180 − Were that picture
But rated at my lordship, 'twere too cheap.
182 I fear I spoke or did I know not what;
All sense of providence was in mine eye.
184
Enter Ferentes, Mauruccio, and Giacopo.
186
Feren. [Aside] Youth in threescore years and ten! −
188 Trust me, my Lord Mauruccio, you are now younger 

33
in the judgment of those that compare your former
190 age with your latter by seven-and-twenty years
than you were three years ago: by all my fidelity,
192 tis a miracle! the ladies wonder at you.
194 Maur. Let them wonder; I am wise as I am courtly.
196 Gia. The ladies, my lord, call him the green broom
of the court, − he sweeps all before him, − and swear he
198 has a stabbing wit: it is a very glister to laughter.
200 Maur. Nay, I know I can tickle 'em at my pleasure; I
am stiff and strong, Ferentes.
202
Gia. [Aside] A radish-root is a spear of steel in
204 comparison of I know what.
206 Feren. The marquess doth love you.
208 Maur. She doth love me.
210 Feren. And begins to do you infinite grace,
Mauruccio, infinite grace.
212
Ferna. I'll take this time. −
 [Comes forward] Good hour, my lords, to both!
214
Maur. Right princely Fernando, the best of the
216 Fernandos; by the pith of generation, the man I look
for. His highness hath sent to find you out: he is
218 determined to weather his own proper individual
person for two days' space in my Lord Nibrassa's
220 forest, to hunt the deer, the buck, the roe, and eke
the barren doe.
222
Ferna. Is his highness preparing to hunt?
224
Feren. Yes, my lord, and resolved to lie forth for
226 the breviating the prolixity of some superfluous
transmigration of the sun's double cadence to the
228 western horizon, my most perspicuous good lord.
230 Ferna. O, sir, let me beseech you to speak in your
own mother tongue. − [Aside] Two days' absence,
232 well. – My Lord Mauruccio, I have a suit t'ee, −
234 Maur. My Lord Fernando, I have a suit to you.
236 Ferna. That you will accept from me a very choice
token of my love: will you grant it? 

34
238
Maur. Will you grant mine?
240
Ferna. What is't?
242
Maur. Only to know what the suit is you please to
244 prefer to me.
246 Ferna. Why, 'tis, my lord, a fool.
248 Maur. A fool?
250 Ferna. As very a fool as your lordship is − hopeful to
see in any time of your life.
252
Gia. Now, good my lord, part not with the fool on
254 any terms.
256 Maur. I beseech you, my lord, has the fool qualities?
258 Ferna. Very rare ones: you shall not hear him
speak one wise word in a month's converse; passing
260 temperate of diet, for, keep him from meat four-andtwenty hours, and he will fast a whole day and a
262 night together; unless you urge him to swear, there
seldom comes an oath from his mouth; and of a
264 fool, my lord, to tell ye the plain truth, had 'a but
half as much wit as you, my lord, he would be in
266 short time three-quarters as arrant-wise as your
lordship.
268
Maur. Giacopo, these are very rare elements in a
270 creature of little understanding. Oh, that I long to
see him!
272
Ferna. A very harmless idiot; − and, as you could
274 wish, look where he comes.
276 Enter Petruchio, and Roseilli dressed like a Fool.
278 Pet. Nephew, here is the thing you sent for. − Come
hither, fool; come: 'tis a good fool.
280
Ferna. Here, my lord, I freely give you the fool; pray
282 use him well for my sake.
284 Maur. I take the fool most thankfully at your hands,
my lord. − Hast any qualities, my pretty fool? wilt
286 dwell with me? 

35
288 Ros. A, a, a, a, ay.
290 Pet. I never beheld a more natural creature in my
life.
292
Ferna. Uncle, − the duke, I hear, prepares to hunt;
294 Let's in and wait. − Farewell, Mauruccio.
296 [Exeunt Fernando and Petruchio.]
298 Maur. Beast that I am, not to ask the fool's name! 'tis
no matter; "fool" is a sufficient title to call the greatest
300 lord in the court by, if he be no wiser than he.
302 Gia. O, my lord, what an arrant excellent pretty
creature 'tis! − Come, honey, honey, honey, come!
304
Feren. You are beholding to my Lord Fernando for
306 this gift.
308 Maur. True. Oh, that he could but speak methodically!
− Canst speak, fool?
310
Ros. Can speak; de e e e −
312
Feren. 'Tis a present for an emperor. What an
314 excellent instrument were this to purchase a suit
or a monopoly from the duke's ear!
316
Maur. I have it, I am wise and fortunate. − Giacopo,
318 I will leave all conceits, and, instead of my picture,
offer the lady marquess this mortal man of weak
320 brain.
322 Gia. My lord, you have most rarely bethought you;
for so shall she no oftener see the fool, but she shall
324 remember you better than by a thousand lookingglasses.
326
Feren. She will most graciously entertain it.
328
Maur. I may tell you, Ferentes, there's not a great
330 woman amongst forty but knows how to make sport
with a fool. − Dost know how old thou art, sirrah?
332
Ros. Dud − a clap cheek for nown sake, gaffer;
334 hee e e e e.
336 Feren. Alas, you must ask him no questions, but clap

36
him on the cheek; I understand his language: your
338 fool is the tender-hearted'st creature that is.
340 Enter Fiormonda and D’Avolos in close conversation.
342 Fiorm. No more; thou hast in this discovery
Exceeded all my favours, D'Avolos.
344 Is't Mistress Madam Duchess? brave revenge!
346 D’Av. But had your grace seen the infinite appetite
of lust in the piercing adultery of his eye, you
348 would −
350 Fiorm. Or change him, or confound him: prompt dissembler!
Is here the bond of his religious vow?
352 And that, “now when the duke is rid abroad,
My gentleman will stay behind, is sick" − or so?
354
D’Av. "Not altogether in health;" it was the excuse
356 he made.
358 Maur. [Seeing them] Most fit opportunity! her grace
comes just i' the nick; let me study.
360
Feren. Lose no time, my lord.
362
Gia. To her, sir.
364
Maur. [To Fiormonda]
366 Vouchsafe to stay thy foot, most Cynthian hue,
 And, from a creature ever vowed thy servant,
368 Accept this gift, most rare, most fine, most new;
 The earnest penny of a love so fervent.
370
Fiorm. What means the jolly youth?
372
Maur. Nothing, sweet princess, but only to present
374 your grace with this sweet-faced fool; please you to
accept him to make you merry: I'll assure your grace
376 he is a very wholesome fool.
378 Fiorm. A fool! you might as well ha' given yourself.
Whence is he?
380
Maur. Now, just very now, given me out of special
382 favour by the Lord Fernando, madam.
384 Fiorm. By him? well, I accept him; thank you for't:
And, in requital, take that toothpicker; 

37
386 'Tis yours.
388 Maur. A toothpicker! I kiss your bounty: no quibble
now? − And, madam,
390 If I grow sick, to make my spirits quicker,
 I will revive them with this sweet toothpicker.
392
Fiorm. Make use on't as you list. − Here D'Avolos,
394 Take in the fool.
396 D'Av. Come, sweetheart, wilt along with me?
398 Ros. U u umh, − u u mh, − wonnot, wonnot − u u umh.
400 Fiorm. Wilt go with me, chick?
402 Ros. Will go, te e e − go will go −
404 Fiorm. Come D'Avolos, observe to-night; 'tis late:
Or I will win my choice, or curse my fate.
406
[Exeunt Fiormonda, Roseilli, and D’Avolos.]
408
Feren. This was wisely done, now. 'Sfoot, you
410 purchase a favour from a creature, my lord, the
greatest king of the earth would be proud of.
412
Maur. Giacopo! −
414
Gia. My lord?
416
Maur. Come behind me, Giacopo: I am big with
418 conceit, and must be delivered of poetry in the
eternal commendation of this gracious toothpicker:
420 − but, first, I hold it a most healthy policy to make
a slight supper –
422
 For meat's the food that must preserve our lives,
424 And now's the time when mortals whet their knives −
426 on thresholds, shoe-soles, cart-wheels, &c. − Away,
Giacopo!
428
[Exeunt.]

ACT II, SCENE III.
The Palace: Bianca's Apartment.
Enter Colona with Lights, Bianca, Fiormonda, Julia,
Fernando, and D’Avolos; Colona places the lights
on a table, and sets down a chess-board.
1 Bian. 'Tis yet but early night, too soon to sleep:
2 Sister, shall's have a mate at chess?
4 Fiorm. "A mate"! −
No, madam, you are grown too hard for me;
6 My Lord Fernando is a fitter match.
8 Bian. He's a well-practised gamester: well, I care not
How cunning soe'er he be. − To pass an hour,
10 I'll try your skill, my lord: reach here the chess-board.
12 D’Av. [Aside] Are you so apt to "try his skill", madam
duchess? Very good!
14
Ferna. I shall bewray too much my ignorance
16 In striving with your highness; 'tis a game
I lose at still by oversight.
18
Bian. Well, well,
20 I fear you not; let's to't.
22 Fiorm. You need not, madam.
24 D’Av. [Aside to Fiormonda] Marry, needs she not;
how gladly will she to't! 'tis a rook to a queen she
26 heaves a pawn to a knight's place; by'r lady, if all be
truly noted, to a duke's place; and that's beside the
28 play, I can tell ye.
30 [Fernando and Bianca play.]
32 Fiorm. Madam, I must entreat excuse; I feel
The temper of my body not in case
34 To judge the strife.
36 Bian. Lights for our sister, sirs! −
Good rest t'ee; I'll but end my game and follow.
38
Fiorm. [Aside to D’Avolos]
40 Let 'em have time enough; and, as thou canst,
Be near to hear their courtship, D'Avolos. 

39
42
D’Av. [Aside to Fiormonda] Madam, I shall observe
44 'em with all cunning secrecy.
46 Bian. Colona, attend our sister to her chamber.
48 Col. I shall, madam.
50 [Exit Fiormonda, followed by Colona,
Julia, and D’Avolos.]
52
Bian. Play.
54
Ferna. I must not lose th’ advantage of the game:
56 Madam, your queen is lost.
58 Bian. My clergy help me!
My queen! and nothing for it but a pawn?
60 Why, then, the game's lost too: but play.
62 Ferna. What, madam?
64 [Fernando often looks about.]
66 Bian. You must needs play well, you are so studious. −
Fie upon't! you study past patience: −
68 What d'ee dream on? here's demurring
Would weary out a statue! − Good, now, play.
70
Ferna. [Kneeling]
72 Forgive me; let my knees forever stick
Nailed to the ground, as earthy as my fears,
74 Ere I arise, to part away so cursed
In my unbounded anguish as the rage
76 Of flames beyond all utterance of words
Devour me, lightened by your sacred eyes.
78
Bian. What means the man?
80
Ferna. To lay before your feet
82 In lowest vassalage the bleeding heart
That sighs the tender of a suit disdained.
84 Great lady, pity me, my youth, my wounds;
And do not think that I have culled this time
86 From motion's swiftest measure to unclasp
The book of lust: if purity of love
88 Have residence in virtue's quest, lo here,
Bent lower in my heart than on my knee,
90 I beg compassion to a love as chaste 

40
As softness of desire can intimate.
92
Re-enter D’Avolos behind.
94
D’Av. [Aside] At it already! admirable haste!
96
Bian. Am I again betrayed? bad man! −
98
Ferna. Keep in
100 Bright angel, that severer breath, to cool
That heat of cruëlty which sways the temple
102 Of your too stony breast: you cannot urge
One reason to rebuke my trembling plea,
104 Which I have not with many nights' expense
Examined; but, O, madam, still I find
106 No physic strong to cure a tortured mind,
But freedom from the torture it sustains.
108
D’Av. [Aside] Not kissing yet? still on your
110 knees? O, for a plump bed and clean sheets,
to comfort the aching of his shins! We shall
112 have 'em clip anon and lisp kisses; here's
ceremony with a vengeance!
114
Bian. Rise up; we charge you, rise!
116
[He rises.]
118
 Look on our face:
120 What see you there that may persuade a hope
Of lawless love? Know, most unworthy man,
122 So much we hate the baseness of thy lust,
As, were none living of thy sex but thee,
124 We had much rather prostitute our blood
To some envenomed serpent than admit
126 Thy bestial dalliance. Couldst thou dare to speak
Again, when we forbad? no, wretched thing,
128 Take this for answer: if thou henceforth ope
Thy leprous mouth to tempt our ear again,
130 We shall not only certify our lord
Of thy disease in friendship, but revenge
132 Thy boldness with the forfeit of thy life.
Think on't.
134
D’Av. [Aside] Now, now, now the game is a-foot!
136 your gray jennet with the white face is curried,
forsooth; − please your lordship leap up into the 

41
138 saddle, forsooth. − Poor duke, how does thy head
ache now!
140
Ferna. Stay; go not hence in choler, blessèd woman!
142 You've schooled me; lend me hearing: though the float
Of infinite desires swell to a tide
144 Too high so soon to ebb, yet, by this hand,
146 [Kisses her hand.]
148 This glorious, gracious hand of yours, −
150 D’Av. [Aside] Ay, marry, the match is made;
clap hands and to't, ho!
152
Ferna. I swear,
154 Henceforth I never will as much in word,
In letter, or in syllable, presume
156 To make a repetition of my griefs.
Good-night t'ee! If, when I am dead, you rip
158 This coffin of my heart, there shall you read
With constant eyes, what now my tongue defines, −
160 Bianca's name carved out in bloody lines.
Forever, lady, now good-night!
162
Bian. Good-night!
164 Rest in your goodness. − Lights there! −
166 Enter Attendants with lights.
168 Sir, good-night!
170 [Exeunt Bianca and Fernando sundry ways,
with Attendants.]
172
D’Av. So, via! − To be cuckold − mercy and
174 providence − is as natural to a married man as to eat,
sleep, or wear a nightcap. Friends! − I will rather trust
176 mine arm in the throat of a lion, my purse with a
courtesan, my neck with the chance on a die, or my
178 religion in a synagogue of Jews, than my wife with
a friend. Wherein do princes exceed the poorest
180 peasant that ever was yoked to a sixpenny strumpet,
but that the horns of the one are mounted some
182 two inches higher by a choppine than the other?
O Actaeon! the goodliest-headed beast of the
184 forest amongst wild cattle is a stag; and the
goodliest beast among tame fools in a corporation
186 is a cuckold. 

42
188 Re-enter Fiormonda.
190 Fiorm. Speak, D'Avolos, how thrives intelligence?
192 D’Av. Above the prevention of Fate, madam. I saw
him kneel, make pitiful faces, kiss hands and
194 forefingers, rise, − and by this time he is up, up,
madam. Doubtless the youth aims to be duke,
196 for he is gotten into the duke's seat an hour ago.
198 Fiorm. Is't true?
200 D’Av. Oracle, oracle! Siege was laid, parley admitted,
composition offered, and the fort entered; there's no
202 interruption. The duke will be at home to-morrow,
gentle animal! − what d'ee resolve?
204
Fiorm. To stir-up tragedies as black as brave,
206 And send the lecher panting to his grave.
208 [Exeunt.] 

43
ACT II, SCENE IV.
Fernando's Bedchamber in the Palace.
Enter Bianca, her hair about her ears,
in her night-mantle. She draws a curtain,
and Fernando is discovered in bed, sleeping;
she sets down the candle before the bed,
and goes to the bedside.
1 Bian. Resolve, and do; 'tis done. − What! are those eyes,
2 Which lately were so overdrowned in tears,
So easy to take rest? Oh happy man!
4 How sweetly sleep hath sealed up sorrows here!
But I will call him. − What, my lord, my lord,
6 My Lord Fernando!
8 Ferna. Who calls me?
10 Bian. My lord,
Sleeping or waking?
12
Ferna. Ha! who is't?
14
Bian. 'Tis I:
16 Have you forgot my voice? or is your ear
But useful to your eye?
18
Ferna. Madam, the duchess!
20
Bian. She, 'tis she; sit up,
22 Sit up and wonder, whiles my sorrows swell:
The nights are short, and I have much to say.
24
Ferna. Is't possible 'tis you?
26
Bian. 'Tis possible:
28 Why do you think I come?
30 Ferna. Why! to crown joys,
And make me master of my best desires.
32
Bian. 'Tis true, you guess aright; sit up and listen.
34 With shame and passion now I must confess,
Since first mine eyes beheld you, in my heart
36 You have been only king; if there can be
A violence in love, then I have felt
38 That tyranny: be record to my soul 

44
The justice which I for this folly fear!
40 Fernando, in short words, howe'er my tongue
Did often chide thy love, each word thou spak'st
42 Was music to my ear; was never poor,
Poor wretched woman lived that loved like me,
44 So truly, so unfeignèdly.
46 Ferna. O, madam!
48 Bian. To witness that I speak is truth, look here!
Thus singly I adventure to thy bed,
50 And do confess my weakness: if thou tempt'st
My bosom to thy pleasures, I will yield.
52
Ferna. Perpetual happiness!
54
Bian. Now hear me out.
56 When first Caraffa, Pavy's duke, my lord,
Saw me, he loved me; and, without respect
58 Of dower, took me to his bed and bosom;
Advanced me to the titles I possess,
60 Not moved by counsel or removed by greatness;
Which to requite, betwixt my soul and Heaven,
62 I vowed a vow to live a constant wife:
I have done so; nor was there in the world
64 A man created could have broke that truth
For all the glories of the earth but thou, −
66 But thou, Fernando! Do I love thee now?
68 Ferna. Beyond imagination.
70 Bian. True, I do,
Beyond imagination: if no pledge
72 Of love can instance what I speak is true
But loss of my best joys, here, here, Fernando,
74 Be satisfied and ruin me.
76 Ferna. What d'ee mean?
78 Bian. To give my body up to thy embraces,
A pleasure that I never wished to thrive in
80 Before this fatal minute. Mark me now;
If thou dost spoil me of this robe of shame,
82 By my best comforts, here I vow again,
To thee, to Heaven, to the world, to time,
84 Ere yet the morning shall new-christen day,
I'll kill myself!
86
Ferna. How, madam, how! 

45
88
Bian. I will:
90 Do what thou wilt, 'tis in thy choice: what say ye?
92 Ferna. Pish! do you come to try me? tell me, first,
Will you but grant a kiss?
94
Bian. Yes, take it; that,
96 Or what thy heart can wish: I am all thine.
98 [Fernando kisses her.]
100 Ferna. Oh, me! − Come, come; how many women, pray,
Were ever heard or read of, granted love,
102 And did as you protest you will?
104 Bian. Fernando,
Jest not at my calamity. I kneel:
106
[Kneels.]
108
By these dishevelled hairs, these wretched tears,
110 By all that's good, if what I speak my heart
Vows not eternally, then think, my lord,
112 Was never man sued to me I denied, −
Think me a common and most cunning whore;
114 And let my sins be written on my grave,
My name rest in reproof!
116
[Rises.]
118
 Do as you list.
120
Ferna. I must believe ye, − yet I hope anon,
122 When you are parted from me, you will say
I was a good, cold, easy-spirited man,
124 Nay, laugh at my simplicity: say, will ye?
126 Bian. No, by the faith I owe my bridal vows!
But ever hold thee much, much dearer far
128 Than all my joys on earth, by this chaste kiss.
130 [Kisses him.]
132 Ferna. You have prevailed; and Heaven forbid that I
Should by a wanton appetite profane
134 This sacred temple! 'tis enough for me
You'll please to call me servant.
136

46
Bian. Nay, be thine:
138 Command my power, my bosom; and I'll write
This love within the tables of my heart.
140
Ferna. Enough: I'll master passion, and triumph
142 In being conquered; adding to it this,
In you my love as it begun shall end.
144
Bian. The latter I new-vow. But day comes on;
146 What now we leave unfinished of content,
Each hour shall pérfect up: sweet, let [u]s part.
148
Ferna. This kiss, − best life, good rest!
150
[Kisses her.]
152
Bian. All mine to thee!
154 Remember this, and think I speak thy words;
"When I am dead, rip up my heart, and read
156 With constant eyes, what now my tongue defines,
Fernando's name carved out in bloody lines."
158 Once more, good rest, sweet!
160 Ferna. Your most faithful servant!
162 [Exit Bianca − Scene closes.]

47
ACT III.
SCENE I.
An Apartment in the Palace.
Enter Nibrassa chafing, after him Julia weeping.
1 Nib. Get from me, strumpet, infamous whore,
2 leprosy of my blood! make thy moan to
ballad-singers and rhymers; they'll jig-out thy
4 wretchedness and abominations to new tunes:
as for me, I renounce thee; th'art no daughter
6 of mine; I disclaim the legitimation of thy birth,
and curse the hour of thy nativity.
8
Jul. Pray, sir, vouchsafe me hearing.
10
Nib. With child! shame to my grave! O, whore,
12 wretched beyond utterance or reformation, what
wouldst say?
14
Jul. Sir, by the honour of my mother's hearse,
16 He has protested marriage, pledged his faith;
If vows have any force, I am his wife.
18
Nib. His faith! Why, thou fool, thou wickedly20 credulous fool, canst thou imagine luxury is
observant of religion? no, no; it is with a
22 frequent lecher as usual to forswear as to swear;
their piety is in making idolatry a worship; their
24 hearts and their tongues are as different as thou,
(thou whore!) and a virgin.
26
Jul. You are too violent; his truth will prove
28 His constancy, and so excuse my fault.
30 Nib. Shameless woman! this belief will damn thee.
How will thy lady marquess justly reprove me for
32 preferring to her service a monster of so lewd and
impudent a life! Look to't; if thy smooth devil
34 leave thee to thy infamy, I will never pity thy
mortal pangs, never lodge thee under my roof,
36 never own thee for my child; mercy be my witness!
38 Enter Petruchio, leading Colona.
40 Pet. Hide not thy folly by unwise excuse, 

48
Thou art undone, Colona; no entreaties,
42 No warning, no persuasion, could put off
The habit of thy dotage on that man
44 Of much deceit, Ferentes. Would thine eyes
Had seen me in my grave, ere I had known
46 The stain of this thine honour!
48 Col. Good my lord,
Reclaim your incredulity: my fault
50 Proceeds from lawful compositiön
Of wedlock; he hath sealed his oath to mine
52 To be my husband.
54 Nib. Husband! hey-da! is't even so? nay, then, we
have partners in affliction: if my jolly gallant's long
56 clapper have struck on both sides, all is well. −
Petruchio, thou art not wise enough to be a paritor:
58 come hither, man, come hither; speak softly; is thy
daughter with child?
60
Pet. With child, Nibrassa!
62
Nib. Foh! do not trick me off; I overheard your
64 gabbling. Hark in thine ear: so is mine too.
66 Pet. Alas, my lord, by whom?
68 Nib. Innocent! by whom? what an idle question is
that! One cock hath trod both our hens: Ferentes,
70 Ferentes; who else? How dost take it? methinks
thou art wondrous patient: why, I am mad, stark
72 mad.
74 Pet. How like you this, Colona? 'tis too true:
Did not this man protest to be your husband?
76
Col. Ay me! to me he did.
78
Nib. What else, what else, Petruchio? − and,
80 madam, my quondam daughter, I hope h'ave
passed some huge words of matrimony to you
82 too.
84 Jul. Alas! to me he did.
86 Nib. And how many more, the great incubus of hell
knows best. − Petruchio, give me your hand; mine
88 own daughter in this arm, − and yours, Colona, in
this: − there, there, sit ye down together. 

49
90
[Julia and Colona sit down.]
92
Never rise, as you hope to inherit our blessings,
94 till you have plotted some brave revenge; think
upon it to purpose, and you shall want no seconds
96 to further it; be secret one to another. − Come,
Petruchio, let 'em alone: the wenches will demur
98 on't, and for the process we'll give 'em courage.
100 Pet. You counsel wisely; I approve your plot. –
Think on your shames, and who it was that wrought 'em.
102
Nib. Ay, ay, ay, leave them alone. − To work,
104 wenches, to work!
106 [Exeunt Nibrassa and Petruchio.]
108 Col. We are quite ruined.
110 Jul. True, Colona,
Betrayed to infamy, deceived, and mocked,
112 By an unconstant villain: what shall's do?
I am with child.
114
Col. Hey-ho! and so am I:
116 But what shall's do now?
118 Jul. This: with cunning words
First prove his love; he knows I am with child.
120
Col. And so he knows I am; I told him on't
122 Last meeting in the lobby, and, in troth,
The false deceiver laughed.
124
Jul. Now, by the stars,
126 He did the like to me, and said 'twas well
I was so haply sped.
128
Col. Those very words
130 He used to me: it fretted me to th' heart:
I'll be revenged.
132
Jul. Peace! here's a noise, methinks.
134 Let's rise; we'll take a time to talk of this.
136 [They rise, and walk aside.]
138 Enter Ferentes and Morona, an old lady. 

50
140 Feren. Will ye? hold. Death of my delights, have ye
lost all sense of shame? Y'are best roar about the
142 court that I have been your woman's-barber and
trimmed ye, kind Morona.
144
Mor. Defiance to thy kindness! th'ast robbed me of
146 my good name; didst promise to love none but me,
me, only me; swor'st like an unconscionable villain,
148 to marry me the twelfth day of the month two months
since; didst make my bed thine own, mine house
150 thine own, mine all and everything thine own. I will
exclaim to the world on thee, and beg justice of the
152 duke himself, villain! I will.
154 Feren. Yet again? nay, and if you be in that mood,
shut up your fore-shop, I'll be your journeyman no
156 longer. Why, wise Madam Dryfist, could your mouldy
brain be so addle to imagine I would marry a stale
158 widow at six-and-forty? Marry gip! are there not
varieties enough of thirteen? come, stop your
160 clap-dish, or I'll purchase a carting for you. − By this
light, I have toiled more with this tough carrion
162 hen than with ten quails scarce grown into their
first feathers.
164
Mor. O, treason to all honesty or religion! − Speak,
166 thou perjured, damnable, ungracious defiler of
women: who shall father my child which thou
168 hast begotten?
170 Feren. Why, thee, countrywoman; th'ast a larger
purse to pay for the nursing. Nay, if you'll needs
172 have the world know how you, reputed a grave,
matron-like, motherly madam, kicked up your
174 heels like a jennet whose mark is new come into
her mouth, e'en do, do! the worst can be said of
176 me is, that I was ill-advised to dig for gold in a
coal-pit. Are you answered?
178
Mor. Answered!
180
Jul. Let's fall amongst 'em.
182
[Julia comes forward with Colona]
184
 [To Ferentes] − Love, how is't, chick? ha?
186
Col. My dear Ferentes, my betrothèd lord! 

51
188
Feren. [Aside] Excellent! O, for three Barbary
190 stone-horses to top three Flanders mares! − Why,
how now, wenches! what means this?
192
Mor. Out upon me! here's more of his trulls.
194
Jul. [To Ferentes] Love, you must go with me.
196
Col. [To Ferentes] Good love, let's walk.
198
Feren. [Aside] I must rid my hands of 'em, or they'll
200 ride on my shoulders. − By your leave, ladies; here's
none but is of common counsel one with another; in
202 short, there are three of ye with child, you tell me
by me. All of you I cannot satisfy, nor, indeed,
204 handsomely any of ye. You all hope I should marry
you; which, for that it is impossible to be done, I
206 am content to have neither of ye: for your looking
big on the matter, keep your own counsels, I'll not
208 bewray ye! but for marriage, − Heaven bless ye, and
me from ye! This is my resolution.
210
Col. How, not me!
212
Jul. Not me!
214
Mor. Not me!
216
Feren. Nor you, nor you, nor you: and to give you
218 some satisfaction, I'll yield you reasons. − You, Colona,
had a pretty art in your dalliance; but your fault was,
220 you were too suddenly won. − You, Madam Morona,
could have pleased well enough some three or four222 and-thirty years ago; but you are too old. − You, Julia,
were young enough, but your fault is, you have a
224 scurvy face. − Now, everyone knowing her proper
defect, thank me that I ever vouchsafed you the
226 honour of my bed once in your lives. If you want
clouts, all I'll promise is to rip up an old shirt or
228 two. So, wishing a speedy deliverance to all your
burdens, I commend you to your patience.
230
[Exit Ferentes.]
232
Mor. Excellent!
234

52
Jul. Notable!
236
Col. Unmatchèd villain!
238
Jul. [To Morona]
240 Madam, though strangers, yet we understand
Your wrongs do equal ours; which to revenge,
242 Please but to join with us, and we'll redeem
Our loss of honour by a brave exploit.
244
Mor. I embrace your motion, ladies, with gladness,
246 and will strive by any action to rank with you in
any danger.
248
Col. Come, gentlewomen, let's together, then. −
250 Thrice happy maids that never trusted men!
252 [Exeunt.]

53
ACT III, SCENE II.
The State-room in the Palace.
Enter the Duke, Bianca supported by Fernando,
Fiormonda, Petruchio, Nibrassa,
Ferentes, and D'Avolos.
1 Duke. Roseilli will not come, then! will not? well;
2 His pride shall ruin him. − Our letters speak
The duchess' uncle will be here to-morrow, −
4 To-morrow, D'Avolos.
6 D’Av. To-morrow night, my lord, but not to make
more than one day's abode here; for his Holiness
8 has commanded him to be at Rome the tenth of
this month, the conclave of cardinals not being
10 resolved to sit till his coming.
12 Duke. Your uncle, sweetheart, at his next return
Must be saluted "cardinal". − Ferentes,
14 Be it your charge to think on some device
To entertain the present with delight.
16
Ferna. My lord, in honour to the court of Pavy,
18 I'll join with you. − Ferentes, not long since
I saw in Bruxils, at my being there,
20 The Duke of Brabant welcome the Archbishop
Of Mentz with rare conceit, even on a sudden,
22 Performed by knights and ladies of his court,
In nature of an antic; which methought −
24 For that I ne'er before saw women-antics −
Was for the newness strange, and much commended.
26
Bian. Now, good my Lord Fernando, further this
28 In any wise; it cannot but content.
30 Fiorm. [Aside] If she entreat, 'tis ten to one the man
Is won beforehand.
32
Duke. Friend, thou honour'st me:
34 But can it be so speedily performed?
36 Ferna. I'll undertake it, if the ladies please
To exercise in person only that:
38 And we must have a fool, or such an one
As can with art well act him.
40

54
Fiorm. I shall fit ye;
42 I have a natural.
44 Ferna. Best of all, madam:
Then nothing wants. − You must make one, Ferentes.
46
Feren. With my best service and dexterity,
48 My lord.
50 Pet. [Aside to Nibrassa]
 This falls out happily, Nibrassa.
52
Nib. [Aside to Petruchio] We could not wish it better:
54 Heaven is an unbribed justice.
56 Duke. We'll meet our uncle in a solemn grace
Of zealous presence, as becomes the church: −
58 See all the choir be ready, D'Avolos.
60 D’Av. I have already made your highness' pleasure
known to them.
62
Bian. [To Fernando] Your lip, my lord!
64
Ferna. Madam?
66
Bian. Perhaps your teeth have bled: wipe't with my
68 handkercher: give me, I'll do't myself. −
[Aside to Fernando] Speak, shall I steal a kiss?
70 believe me, my lord, I long.
72 Ferna. Not for the world.
74 Fiorm. [Aside] Apparent impudence!
76 D’Av. Beshrew my heart, but that's not so good.
78 Duke. Ha, what's that thou mislik[e]st, D'Avolos?
80 D'Av. Nothing, my lord; − but I was hammering a
conceit of my own, which cannot, I find, in so
82 short a time thrive as a day's practice.
84 Fiorm. [Aside] Well put off, secretary.
86 Duke. We are too sad; methinks the life of mirth
Should still be fed where we are: where's Mauruccio?
88
Feren. And't please your highness, he's of late grown
90 so affectionately inward with my lady marquess's
fool, that I presume he is confident there are few 

55
92 wise men worthy of his society, who are not as
innocently harmless as that creature. It is almost
94 impossible to separate them, and 'tis a question
which of the two is the wiser man.
96
Duke. Would 'a were here! I have a kind of dulness
98 Hangs on me since my hunting, that I feel
As 'twere a disposition to be sick;
100 My head is ever aching.
102 D’Av. A shrewd ominous token; I like not that neither.
104 Duke. Again! what is't you like not?
106 D’Av. I beseech your highness excuse me; I am so
busy with [t]his frivolous project, and can bring it to
108 no shape, that it almost confounds my capacity.
110 Bian. My lord, you were best to try a set at maw.
I and your friend, to pass away the time,
112 Will undertake your highness and your sister.
114 Duke. The game's too tedious.
116 Fiorm. 'Tis a peevish play;
Your knave will heave the queen out, or your king;
118 Besides, 'tis all on fortune.
120 Enter Mauruccio with Roseilli disguised
as before, and Giacopo.
122
Maur. Bless thee, most excellent duke! I here present
124 thee as worthy and learned a gentleman as ever I − and
yet I have lived threescore years − conversed with.
126 Take it from me, I have tried him, and he is worthy
to be privy-counsellor to the greatest Turk in
128 Christendom; of a most apparent and deep
understanding, slow of speech, but speaks to the
130 purpose. − Come forward, sir, and appear before his
highness in your own proper elements.
132
Ros. Will − tye − to da new toate sure la now.
134
Gia. A very senseless gentleman, and, please your
136 highness, one that has a great deal of little wit, as
they say.
138
Maur. O, sir, had you heard him, as I did, deliver
140 whole histories in the Tangay tongue, you would 

56
swear there were not such a linguist breathed again;
142 and did I but perfectly understand his language, I
would be confident in less than two hours to
144 distinguish the meaning of bird, beast, or fish
naturally as I myself speak Italian, my lord. Well,
146 he has rare qualities!
148 Duke. Now, prithee, question him, Mauruccio.
150 Maur. I will, my lord. –
 Tell me, rare scholar, which, in thy opinion,
152 Doth cause the strongest breath, garlíc or onion?
154 Gia. Answer him, brother-fool; do, do; speak thy
mind, chuck, do.
156
Ros. Have bid seen all da fine knack, and d'ee,
158 naghtye tat-tle of da kna-ve, dad la have so.
160 Duke. We understand him not.
162 Maur. Admirable, I protest, duke; mark, O, duke,
mark! − What did I ask him, Giacopo?
164
Gia. What caused the strongest breath, garlic or
166 onions, I take it, sir.
168 Maur. Right, right, by Helicon! and his answer is,
that a knave has a stronger breath than any of 'em:
170 wisdom − or I am an ass − in the highest; a direct
figure: put it down, Giacopo.
172
Duke. How happy is that idiot whose ambition
174 Is but to eat and sleep, and shun the rod!
Men that have more of wit, and use it ill,
176 Are fools in proof.
178 Bian. True, my lord, there's many
Who think themselves most wise that are most fools.
180
D’Av. Bitter girds, if all were known; − but −
182
Duke. But what? speak out; plague on your muttering, grumbling!
184 I hear you, sir; what is't?
186 D’Av. Nothing, I protest, to your highness pertinent
to any moment.
188
Duke. Well, sir, remember. −
 [To Fernando] Friend, you promised study. −

57
190 I am not well in temper. − Come, Bianca. −
Attend our friend, Ferentes.
192
[Exeunt all but Fernando, Roseilli,
194 Ferentes and Mauruccio.]
196 Ferna. Ferentes, take Mauruccio in with you;
He must be one in action.
198
Feren. Come, my lord,
200 I shall entreat your help.
202 Ferna. I'll stay the fool,
And follow instantly.
204
Maur. Yes, pray, my lord.
206
[Exeunt Ferentes and Mauruccio.]
208
Ferna. How thrive your hopes now, cousin?
210
Ros. Are we safe?
212 Then let me cast myself beneath thy foot,
True, virtuous lord. Know, then, sir, her proud heart
214 Is only fixed on you, in such extremes
Of violence and passion, that I fear,
216 Or she'll enjoy you, or she'll ruin you.
218 Ferna. Me, coz? by all the joys I wish to taste,
She is as far beneath my thought as I
220 In soul above her malice.
222 Ros. I observed
Even now a kind of dangerous pretence
224 In an unjointed phrase from D'Avolos.
I know not his intent; but this I know,
226 He has a working brain, is minister
To all my lady's counsels; and, my lord,
228 Pray Heaven there have not anything befall'n
Within the knowledge of his subtle art
230 To do you mischief!
232 Ferna. Pish! should he or hell
Affront me in the passage of my fate,
234 I'd crush them into atomies.
236 Ros. I do admit you could: meantime, my lord,
Be nearest to yourself; what I can learn,
238 You shall be soon informed of: here is all 

58
We fools can catch the wise in, − to unknot,
240 By privilege of coxcombs, what they plot.
242 [Exeunt.] 

59
ACT III, SCENE III.
Another Room in the Palace.
Enter Duke and D’Avolos.
1 Duke. Thou art a traitor: do not think the gloss
2 Of smooth evasion, by your cunning jests
And coinage of your politician's brain,
4 Shall jig me off; I'll know't, I vow I will.
Did not I note your dark abrupted ends
6 Of words half-spoke? your "wells, if all were known"?
Your short "I like not that"? your girds and "buts"?
8 Yes, sir, I did; such broken language argues
More matter than your subtlety shall hide:
10 Tell me, what is't? by honour's self, I'll know.
12 D'Av. What would you know, my lord? I confess
I owe my life and service to you, as to my prince;
14 the one you have, the other you may take from
me at your pleasure. Should I devise matter to
16 feed your distrust, or suggest likelihoods without
appearance? what would you have me say? I
18 know nothing.
20 Duke. Thou liest, dissembler! on thy brow I read
Distracted horrors figured in thy looks.
22 On thy allegiance, D'Avolos, as e'er
Thou hop'st to live in grace with us, unfold
24 What by the parti-halting of thy speech
Thy knowledge can discover. By the faith
26 We bear to sacred justice, we protest,
Be it or good or evil, thy reward
28 Shall be our special thanks and love untermed:
Speak, on thy duty; we, thy prince, command.
30
D'Av. O, my disaster! my lord, I am so charmed
32 by those powerful repetitions of love and duty,
that I cannot conceal what I know of your
34 dishonour.
36 Duke. Dishonour! then my soul is cleft with fear;
I half presage my misery: say on,
38 Speak it at once, for I am great with grief.
40 D'Av. I trust your highness will pardon me; yet I will
not deliver a syllable which shall be less innocent than
42 truth itself. 

60
44 Duke. By all our wish of joys, we pardon thee.
46 D'Av. Get from me, cowardly servility! − my service
is noble, and my loyalty an armour of brass: in short,
48 my lord, and plain discovery, you are a cuckold.
50 Duke. Keep in the word, − a “cuckold!"
52 D’Av. Fernando is your rival, has stolen your
duchess' heart, murthered friendship, horns your
54 head, and laughs at your horns.
56 Duke. My heart is split!
58 D’Av. Take courage, be a prince in resolution: I
knew it would nettle you in the fire of your
60 composition, and was loth to have given the first
report of this more than ridiculous blemish to all
62 patience or moderation: but, Oh, my lord, what
would not a subject do to approve his loyalty to
64 his sovereign? Yet, good sir, take it as quietly as
you can: I must needs say, 'tis a foul fault; but
66 what man is he under the sun that is free from
the career of his destiny? Maybe she will in time
68 reclaim the errors of her youth; or 'twere a great
happiness in you, if you could not believe it;
70 that's the surest way, my lord, in my poor counsel.
72 Duke. The icy current of my frozen blood
Is kindled up in agonies as hot
74 As flames of burning sulphur. O, my fate!
A cuckold! had my dukedom's whole inheritance
76 Been rent, mine honours levelled in the dust,
So she, that wicked woman, might have slept
78 Chaste in my bosom, 't had been all a sport.
And he, that villain, viper to my heart,
80 That he should be the man!
That he should be the man; death above utterance!
82 Take heed you prove this true.
84 D’Av. My lord, −
86 Duke. If not,
I'll tear thee joint by joint. − P[h]ew! methinks
88 It should not be: − Bianca! why, I took her
From lower than a bondage: − hell of hells! −
90 See that you make it good.
92 D’Av. As for that, would it were as good as I would 

61
make it! I can, if you will temper your distractions,
94 but bring you where you shall see it; no more.
96 Duke. See it!
98 D’Av. Ay, see it, if that be proof sufficient. I, for
my part, will slack no service that may testify my
100 simplicity.
102 Duke. Enough.
104 Enter Fernando.
106 What news, Fernando?
108 Ferna. Sir, the abbot
Is now upon arrival; all your servants
110 Attend your presence.
112 Duke. We will give him welcome
As shall befit our love and his respect.
114 Come, mine own best Fernando, my dear friend.
116 [The Duke exits with Fernando.]
118 D'Av. Excellent! now for a horned moon.
120 [Sound of music within.]
122 But I hear the preparation for the entertainment
of this great abbot. Let him come and go, that
124 matters nothing to this; whiles he rides abroad
in hope to purchase a purple hat, our duke shall
126 as earnestly heat the pericranion of his noddle
with a yellow hood at home. I hear 'em coming.
128
Loud music.
130 Enter Servants with torches; after the Duke,
followed by Fernando, Bianca, Fiormonda,
132 Petruchio, and Nibrassa, at one door;
enter at another door two Friars,
134 the Abbot and Attendants at the other.
The Duke and Abbot meet and salute;
136 Bianca and the rest salute, and are saluted;
they rank themselves, and pass over the stage,
138 and go out. The Choir singing.
D'Avolos only stays.
140
On to your vitailles; some of ye, I know, feed
142 upon wormwood. 

62
144 [Exit.]

63
ACT III, SCENE IV.
Another Apartment in the Palace.
Enter Petruchio and Nibrassa with napkins,
as from supper.
1 Pet. The duke's on rising: − are you ready? ho!
2
[Within] All ready.
4
Nib. Then, Petruchio, arm thyself with courage and
6 resolution; and do not shrink from being stayed on
thy own virtue.
8
Pet. I am resolved. − Fresh lights! − I hear 'em coming.
10
Enter Attendants with lights; after, the Duke, Abbot,
12 Bianca, Flormonda, Fernando, and D’Avolos.
14 Duke. Right reverend uncle, though our minds be scanted
In giving welcome as our hearts would wish,
16 Yet we will strive to shew how much we joy
Your presence with a courtly shew of mirth.
18 Please you to sit.
20 Abbot. Great duke, your worthy honours
To me shall still have place in my best thanks:
22 Since you in me so much respect the church,
Thus much I'll promise, − at my next return
24 His holiness shall grant you an indulgence
Both large and general.
26
Duke. Our humble duty! −
28 Seat you, my lords. − Now let the masquers enter.
30 Enter, in an antic fashion, Ferentes, Roseilli, and
Mauruccio at several doors; they dance a little.
32 Suddenly enter to them Colona, Julia, and Morona
in odd shapes, and dance: the men gaze at them,
34 and are at a stand. The men are invited
by the women to dance. They dance together
36 sundry changes; at last Ferentes is closed in, −
Mauruccio and Roseilli being shook off, stand at
38 different ends of the stage gazing. The women join
hands and dance about Ferentes with divers
40 complimental offers of courtship; at length they
suddenly fall upon him and stab him; he falls down, 

64
42 and they run out at several doors. The music ceases.
44 Feren. Uncase me; I am slain in jest. A pox upon
your outlandish feminine antics! pull off my visor;
46 I shall bleed to death ere I have time to feel where
I am hurt. − Duke, I am slain: off with my visor; for
48 Heaven's sake, off with my visor!
50 Duke. Slain! − Take his visor off −
52 [They unmask Ferentes]
54 we are betrayed:
Seize on them! two are yonder: − hold, Ferentes. −
56 Follow the rest: apparent treachery!
58 Abbot. Holy Saint Bennet, what a sight is this!
60 Re-enter Julia, Colona, and Morona unmasked,
every one with a child in her arms.
62
Jul. Be not amazed, great princes, but vouchsafe
64 Your audience: we are they have done this deed.
Look here, the pledges of this false man's lust,
66 Betrayed in our simplicities: he swore,
And pawned his truth, to marry each of us;
68 Abused us all; unable to revenge
Our public shames but by his public fall,
70 Which thus we have contrived: nor do we blush
To call the glory of this murther ours;
72 We did it, and we'll justify the deed;
For when in sad complaints we claimed his vows,
74 His answer was reproach: − Villain, is't true?
76 Col. I was "too quickly won," you slave!
78 Mor. I was "too old," you dog!
80 Jul. I, − and I never shall forget the wrong, −
I was "not fair enough"; not fair enough
82 For thee, thou monster! − let me cut his gall −
"Not fair enough"! O, scorn! "not fair enough"!
84
[Stabs him.]
86
Feren. O, O, Oh! −
88
Duke. Forbear, you monstrous women! do not add
90 Murther to lust: your lives shall pay this forfeit. 

65
92 Feren. Pox upon all cod-piece extravagancy! I am
peppered − Oh, Oh, Oh! − Duke, forgive me! − Had
94 I rid any tame beasts but Barbary wild colts, I had
not been thus jerked out of the saddle. My forfeit
96 was in my blood; and my life hath answered it.
Vengeance on all wild whores, I say! − Oh, 'tis true −
98 farewell, generation of hackneys! − Ooh!
100 [Dies.]
102 Duke. He is dead.
To prison with those monstrous strumpets!
104
Pet. Stay;
106 I'll answer for my daughter.
108 Nib. And I for mine. −
O, well done, girls!
110
Ferna. I for yon gentlewoman, sir.
112
Maur. Good my lord, I am an innocent in the business.
114
Duke. To prison with him! Bear the body hence.
116
Abbot. Here's fatal sad presages, but 'tis just:
118 He dies by murther that hath lived in lust.
[Exeunt.]. 

66
ACT IV.
SCENE I.
An Apartment in the Palace.
Enter Duke, Fiormonda, and D’Avolos.
1 Fiorm. Art thou Caraffa? is there in thy veins
2 One drop of blood that issued from the loins
Of Pavy's ancient dukes? or dost thou sit
4 On great Lorenzo's seat, our glorious father,
And canst not blush to be so far beneath
6 The spirit of heroic ancestors?
Canst thou engross a slavish shame, which men
8 Far, far below the region of thy state
Not more abhor than study to revenge?
10 Thou an Italian! I could burst with rage
To think I have a brother so befooled
12 In giving patience to a harlot's lust.
14 D'Av. One, my lord, that doth so palpably, so
apparently make her adulteries a trophy, whiles
16 the poting-stick to her unsatiate and more than
goatish abomination jeers at and flouts your
18 sleepish, and more than sleepish, security.
20 Fiorm. What is she but the sallow-coloured brat
Of some unlanded bankrupt, taught to catch
22 The easy fancies of young prodigal bloods
In springes of her stew-instructed art?
24 Here's your most virtuous duchess! your rare piece!
26 D'Av. More base in the infiniteness of her sensuality
than corruption can infect: − to clip and inveigle
28 your friend too! O, unsufferable! − a friend! how
of all men are you most unfortunate! − to pour out
30 your soul into the bosom of such a creature as
holds it religion to make your own trust a key to
32 open the passage to your own wife's womb, to
be drunk in the privacies of your bed! − think
34 upon that, sir.
36 Duke. Be gentle in your tortures, e'en for pity;
For pity's cause I beg it.
38
Fiorm. Be a prince! 

67
40 Th'adst better, duke, thou hadst been born a peasant.
Now boys will sing thy scandal in the streets,
42 Tune ballads to thy infamy, get money
By making pageants of thee, and invent
44 Some strangely-shaped man-beast, that may for horns
Resemble thee, and call it "Pavy's Duke".
46
Duke. Endless immortal plague!
48
D’Av. There's the mischief, sir: in the meantime you
50 shall be sure to have a bastard − of whom you did
not so much as beget a little toe, a left ear, or half
52 the further side of an upper lip − inherit both your
throne and name: this would kill the soul of very
54 patience itself.
56 Duke. Forbear; the ashy paleness of my cheek
Is scarleted in ruddy flakes of wrath;
58 And like some bearded meteor shall suck up,
With swiftest terror, all those dusky mists
60 That overcloud compassion in our breast.
You have roused a sleeping lion, whom no art,
62 No fawning smoothness shall reclaim, but blood. −
And sister thou, − thou, Roderico, thou, −
64 From whom I take the surfeit of my bane,
Henceforth no more so eagerly pursue
66 To whet my dulness: you shall see Caraffa
Equal his birth, and matchless in revenge.
68
Fiorm. Why, now I hear you speak in majesty.
70
D’Av. And it becomes my lord most princely.
72
Duke. Does it? − Come hither, sister. Thou art near
74 In nature, and as near to me in love:
I love thee, yes, by yon bright firmament,
76 I love thee dearly. But observe me well:
If any private grudge or female spleen,
78 Malice or envy, or such woman's frailty,
Have spurred thee on to set my soul on fire
80 Without apparent certainty, − I vow,
And vow again, by all our princely blood,
82 Hadst thou a double soul, or were the lives
Of fathers, mothers, children, or the hearts
84 Of all our tribe in thine, I would unrip
That womb of bloody mischief with these nails
86 Where such a cursèd plot as this was hatched. −

68
But, D'Avolos, for thee − no more; to work
88 A yet more strong impression in my brain,
You must produce an instance to mine eye
90 Both present and apparent − nay, you shall − or −
92 Fiorm. Or what? you will be mad? be rather wise;
Think on Ferentes first, and think by whom
94 The harmless youth was slaughtered: had he lived,
He would have told you tales: Fernando feared it;
96 And to prevent him, − under shew, forsooth,
Of rare device, − most trimly cut him off.
98 Have you yet eyes, duke?
100 Duke. Shrewdly urged, − 'tis piercing.
102 Fiorm. For looking on a sight shall split your soul,
You shall not care: I'll undertake myself
104 To do't some two days hence; for need, to-night,
But that you are in court.
106
D’Av. Right. Would you desire, my lord, to see
108 them exchange kisses, sucking one another's lips,
nay, begetting an heir to the dukedom, or practising
110 more than the very act of adultery itself? Give but
a little way by a feigned absence, and you shall
112 find 'em − I blush to speak doing what: I am mad
to think on't; you are most shamefully, most
114 sinfully, most scornfully cornuted.
116 Duke. D'ee play upon me? as I am your prince,
There's some shall roar for this! Why, what was I,
118 Both to be thought or made so vild a thing? −
Stay, madam marquess, − ho, Roderico, you, sir, −
120 Bear witness that if ever I neglect
One day, one hour, one minute, to wear out
122 With toil of plot or practice of conceit
My busy skull, till I have found a death
124 More horrid than the bull of Phalaris,
Or all the fabling poets, dreaming whips;
126 If ever I take rest, or force a smile
Which is not borrowed from a royal vengeance,
128 Before I know which way to satisfy
Fury and wrong, − nay, kneel down, −
130
[They kneel.]
132
 let me die
134 More wretched than despair, reproach, contempt, 

69
Laughter, and poverty itself can make me!
136 Let's rise on all sides friends: −
138 [They rise.]
140 now all's agreed:
If the moon serve, some that are safe shall bleed.
142
Enter Bianca, Fernando, and Morona.
144
Bian. My lord the duke, −
146
Duke. Bianca! ha, how is't?
148 How is't, Bianca? − What, Fernando! − come,
Shall's shake hands, sirs? − 'faith, this is kindly done.
150 Here's three as one: welcome, dear wife, sweet friend!
152 D’Av. [Aside to Fiormonda] I do not like this now;
it shows scurvily to me.
154
Bian. My lord, we have a suit; your friend and I −
156
Duke. [Aside]
158 She puts my "friend" before, most kindly still.
160 Bian. Must join −
162 Duke. What, "must"?
164 Bian. My lord! −
166 Duke. "Must join", you say −
168 Bian. That you will please to set Mauruccio
At liberty; this gentlewoman here
170 Hath, by agreement made betwixt them two,
Obtained him for her husband: good my lord,
172 Let me entreat; I dare engage mine honour,
He's innocent in any wilful fault.
174
Duke. Your honour, madam! now beshrew you for't,
176 T' engage your honour on so slight a ground:
Honour's a precious jewël, I can tell you;
178 Nay, 'tis, Bianca; − go to, D'Avolos,
Bring us Mauruccio hither.
180
D’Av. I shall, my lord.
182
[Exit D'Avolos.]
184

70
Mor. I humbly thank your grace,
186
Ferna. And, royal sir, since Julia and Colona,
188 Chief actors in Ferentes' tragic end,
Were, through their ladies' mediatiön,
190 Freed by your gracious pardon; I, in pity,
Tendered this widow's friendless misery;
192 For whose reprieve I shall, in humblest duty,
Be ever thankful.
194
Re-enter D’Avolos with Mauruccio in poor rags,
196 and Giacopo weeping.
198 Maur. Come you, my learnèd counsel, do not roar;
 If I must hang, why, then, lament therefore:
200 You may rejoice, and both, no doubt, be great
 To serve your prince, when I am turn[è]d worms'-
 meat.
202 I fear my lands and all I have is beggèd;
 Else, woe is me, why should I be so ragged?
204
D'Av. Come on, sir; the duke stays for you.
206
Maur. O, how my stomach doth begin to puke,
208 When I do hear that only word, the duke!
210 Duke. You, sir, look on that woman: are you pleased,
If we remit your body from the jail,
212 To take her for your wife?
214 Maur. On that condition, prince, with all my heart.
216 Mor. Yes, I warrant your grace he is content.
218 Duke. Why, foolish man, hast thou so soon forgot
The public shame of her abus[è]d womb,
220 Her being mother to a bastard's birth?
Or canst thou but imagine she will be
222 True to thy bed who to herself was false?
224 Gia. [To Mauruccio] Phew, sir, do not stand upon
that; that's a matter of nothing, you know.
226
Maur. Nay, and shall please your good grace, and it
228 come to that, I care not; as good men as I have lain
in foul sheets, I am sure; the linen has not been
230 much the worse for the wearing a little: I will have
her with all my heart.
232

71
Duke. And shalt. − Fernando, thou shalt have the grace
234 To join their hands; put 'em together, friend.
236 Bian. Yes, do, my lord; bring you the bridegroom hither;
I'll give the bride myself.
238
D’Av. [Aside] Here's argument to jealousy as good
240 as drink to the dropsy; she will share any disgrace with
him: I could not wish it better.
242
Duke. Even so: well, do it.
244
Ferna. Here, Mauruccio;
246 Long live a happy couple!
248 [Fernando and Bianca join their hands.]
250 Duke. 'Tis enough; −
Now know our pleasure henceforth. 'Tis our will,
252 If ever thou, Mauruccio, or thy wife,
Be seen within a dozen miles at court,
254 We will recall our mercy; no entreat
Shall warrant thee a minute of thy life:
256 We'll have no servile slavery of lust
Shall breathe near us; dispatch, and get ye hence. −
258 Bianca, come with me. − [Aside] O, my cleft soul!
260 [Exeunt Duke and Bianca.]
262 Maur. How's that? must I come no more near the court?
264 Gia. O, pitiful! not near the court, sir!
266 D'Av. Not by a dozen miles, indeed, sir. Your only
course, I can advise you, is to pass to Naples, and set
268 up a house of carnality: there are very fair and
frequent suburbs, and you need not fear the
270 contagion of any pestilent disease, for the worst
is very proper to the place.
272
Ferna. 'Tis a strange sentence.
274
Fiorm. 'Tis, and sudden too,
276 And not without some mystery.
278 D’Av. Will you go, sir?
280 Maur. Not near the court!
282 Mor. What matter is it, sweetheart? fear nothing, 

72
love; you shall have new change of apparel, good
284 diet, wholesome attendance; − and we will live
like pigeons, my lord.
286
Maur. Wilt thou forsake me, Giacopo?
288
Gia. I forsake ye! no, not as long as I have a whole
290 ear on my head, come what will come.
292 Fiorm. Mauruccio, you did once proffer true love
To me, but since you are more thriftier sped,
294 For old affection's sake, here take this gold;
Spend it for my sake.
296
Ferna. Madam, you do nobly, −
298 And that's for me, Mauruccio.
300 [They give him money.]
302 D’Av. Will ye go, sir?
304 Maur. Yes, I will go; − and I humbly thank your
lordship and ladyship. − Pavy, sweet Pavy,
306 farewell! − Come, wife, − come, Giacopo: −
 Now is the time that we away must lag,
308 And march in pomp with baggage and with bag.
 O poor Mauruccio! what hast thou misdone,
310 To end thy life when life was new begun? −
 Adieu to all; for lords and ladies see
312 My woeful plight, and squires of low degree!
314 D’Av. Away, away, sirs!
316 [Exeunt all but Fiormonda and Fernando.]
318 Fiorm. My Lord Fernando, −
320 Ferna. Madam?
322 Fiorm. Do you note
My brother's odd distractions? − You were wont
324 To bosom in his counsels: I am sure
You know the ground on [i]t.
326
Ferna. Not I, in troth.
328
Fiorm. Is't possible? What would you say, my lord,
330 If he, out of some melancholy spleen,
Edged-on by some thank-picking parasite,
332 Should now prove jealous? I mistrust it shrewdly. 

73
334 Ferna. What, madam! jealous?
336 Fiorm. Yes; for but observe,
A prince whose eye is chooser to his heart
338 Is seldom steady in the lists of love,
Unless the party he affects do match
340 His rank in equal portion or in friends:
I never yet, out of report, or else
342 By warranted description, have observed
The nature of fantastic jealousy,
344 If not in him; yet, on my conscience now,
He has no cause.
346
Ferna. Cause, madam! by this light,
348 I'll pledge my soul against a useless rush.
350 Fiorm. I never thought her less; yet, trust me, sir,
No merit can be greater than your praise:
352 Whereat I strangely wonder, how a man
Vowed, as you told me, to a single life,
354 Should so much deify the saints from whom
You have disclaimed devotion.
356
Ferna. Madam, 'tis true;
358 From them I have, but from their virtues never.
360 Fiorm. You are too wise, Fernando. To be plain,
You are in love; − nay, shrink not, man, you are;
362 Bianca is your aim: why do you blush?
She is, I know she is.
364
Ferna. My aim!
366
Fiorm. Yes, yours;
368 I hope I talk no news. Fernando, know
Thou runn'st to thy confusion, if in time
370 Thou dost not wisely shun that Circe's charm.
Unkindest man! I have too long concealed
372 My hidden flames, when still in silent signs
I courted thee for love, without respect
374 To youth or state; and yet thou art unkind.
Fernando, leave that sorceress, if not
376 For love of me, for pity of thyself.
378 Ferna. [Walks aside].
Injurious woman, I defy thy lust.
380 'Tis not your subtle sifting [that] shall creep 

74
Into the secrets of a heart unsoiled. −
382 You are my prince's sister, else your malice
Had railed itself to death; but as for me,
384 Be record all my fate, I do detest
Your fury or affection: − judge the rest.
386
[Exit Fernando.]
388
Fiorm. What, gone! well, go thy ways: I see the more
390 I humble my firm love, the more he shuns
Both it and me. So plain! then 'tis too late
392 To hope; − change, peevish passion, to contempt!
Whatever rages in my blood I feel,
394 Fool, he shall know I was not born to kneel.
396 [Exit.]

75
ACT IV, SCENE II.
Another Room in the Palace.
Enter D’Avolos and Julia.
1 D’Av. Julia, mine own, speak softly. What, hast
2 thou learned out any thing of this pale widgeon?
speak soft; what does she say?
4
Jul. Foh, more than all; there's not an hour shall pass
6 But I shall have intelligence, she swears.
Whole nights − you know my mind; I hope you'll give
8 The gown you promised me.
10 D'Av. Honest Julia, peace; th'art a woman worth a
kingdom. Let me never be believed now but I think
12 it will be my destiny to be thy husband at last: what
though thou have a child, − or perhaps two?
14
Jul. Never but one, I swear.
16
D'Av. Well, one; is that such a matter? I like thee
18 the better for't! it shews thou hast a good tenantable
and fertile womb, worth twenty of your barren, dry,
20 bloodless devourers of youth. − But come, I will
talk with thee more privately; the duke has a
22 journey in hand, and will not be long absent:
see, 'a is come already − let's pass away easily.
24
[Exeunt D'Avolos and Julia.]
26
Enter Duke and Bianca.
28
Duke. Troubled? yes, I have cause. − O, Bianca!
30 Here was my fate engraven in thy brow,
This smooth, fair, polished table; in thy cheeks
32 Nature summed up thy dower: 'twas not wealth,
The miser's god, or royalty of blood,
34 Advanced thee to my bed; but love, and hope
Of virtue that might equal those sweet looks:
36 If, then, thou shouldst betray my trust, thy faith,
To the pollution of a base desire,
38 Thou wert a wretched woman.
40 Bian. Speaks your love
Or fear, my lord?
42

76
Duke. Both, both. Bianca, know,
44 The nightly languish of my dull unrest
Hath stamped a strong opinion; for, methought, −
46 Mark what I say, − as I in glorious pomp
Was sitting on my throne, whiles I had hemmed
48 My best-beloved Bianca in mine arms,
She reached my cap of state, and cast it down
50 Beneath her foot, and spurned it in the dust;
Whiles I − O, 'twas a dream too full of fate! −
52 Was stooping down to reach it, on my head
Fernando, like a traitor to his vows,
54 Clapt, in disgrace, a coronet of horns. −
But, by the honour of anointed kings,
56 Were both of you hid in a rock of fire,
Guarded by ministers of flaming hell,
58 I have a sword − 'tis here − should make my way
Through fire, through darkness, death, and all,
60 To hew your lust-engendered flesh to shreds,
Pound you to mortar, cut your throats, and mince
62 Your flesh to mites: I will, − start not, − I will.
64 Bian. Mercy protect me, will ye murder me?
66 Duke. Yes. − O, I cry thee mercy! − How the rage
Of my undreamt-of wrongs made me forget
68 All sense of sufferance! − Blame me not, Bianca;
One such another dream would quite distract
70 Reason and self-humanity: yet tell me,
Was't not an ominous vision?
72
Bian. 'Twas, my lord,
74 Yet but a vision: for did such a guilt
Hang on mine honour, 'twere no blame in you,
76 If you did stab me to the heart.
78 Duke. The heart?
Nay, strumpet, to the soul; and tear it off
80 From life, to damn it in immortal death.
82 Bian. Alas! what do you mean, sir?
84 Duke. I am mad. −
Forgive me, good Bianca; still methinks
86 I dream and dream anew: now, prithee, chide me.
Sickness and these divisions so distract
88 My senses, that I take things possible
As if they were; which to remove, I mean
90 To speed me straight to Lucca, where, perhaps, 

77
Absence and bathing in those healthful springs
92 May soon recover me; meantime, dear sweet,
Pity my troubled heart; griefs are extreme:
94 Yet, sweet, when I am gone, think on my dream. −
Who waits without? ho!
96
Enter Petruchio, Nibrassa, Fiormonda, D’Avolos,
98 Roseilli disguised as before, and Fernando.
100 Is provision ready,
To pass to Lucca?
102
Pet. It attends your highness,
104
Duke. Friend, hold; take here from me this jewël, this:
106
[Gives Bianca to Fernando.]
108
Be she your care till my return from Lucca,
110 Honest Fernando. − Wife, respect my friend. −
Let's go: − but hear ye, wife, think on my dream.
112
[Exeunt all but Roseilli and Petruchio.]
114
Pet. Cousin, one word with you: doth not this cloud
116 Acquaint you with strange novelties? The duke
Is lately much distempered: what he means
118 By journeying now to Lucca, is to me
A riddle; can you clear my doubt?
120
Ros. O, sir,
122 My fears exceed my knowledge, yet I note
No less than you infer; all is not well;
124 Would 'twere! whosoever thrive, I shall be sure
Never to rise to my unhoped desires.
126 But, cousin, I shall tell you more anon:
Meantime, pray send my Lord Fernando to me;
128 I covet much to speak with him.
130 Pet. And see,
He comes himself; I'll leave you both together.
132
[Exit Petruchio.]
134
Re-enter Fernando.
136
Ferna. The duke is horsed for Lucca.
 [To Roseilli] How now, coz, 

78
138 How prosper you in love?
140 Ros. As still I hoped. −
My lord, you are undone.
142
Ferna. Undone! in what?
144
Ros. Lost; and I fear your life is bought and sold;
146 I'll tell you how. Late in my lady's chamber,
As I by chance lay slumbering on the mats,
148 In comes the lady marquess, and with her
Julia and D'Avolos; where sitting down,
150 Not doubting me, "Madam," quoth D'Avolos,
"We have discovered now the nest of shame."
152 In short, my lord, − for you already know
As much as they reported, − there was told
154 The circumstance of all your private love
And meeting with the duchess; when, at last,
156 False D'Avolos concluded with an oath,
"We'll make," quoth he, "his heart-strings crack for this."
158
Ferna. Speaking of me?
160
Ros. Of you; "Ay," quoth the marquess,
162 "Were not the duke a baby, he would seek
Swift vengeance; for he knew it long ago."
164
Ferna. Let him know it; − yet I vow
166 She is as loyal in her plighted faith
As is the sun in Heaven: but put case
168 She were not, and the duke did know she were not:
This sword lift up, and guided by this arm,
170 Shall guard her from an armèd troop of fiends,
And all the earth beside.
172
Ros. You are too safe
174 In your destruction.
176 Ferna. Damn him! − he shall feel −
But peace! who comes?
178
Enter Colona.
180
Col. My lord, the duchess craves
182 A word with you.
184 Ferna. Where is she?

79
186 Col. In her chamber.
188 Ros. Here, have a plum for ie'ee −
190 Col. Come, fool, I'll give thee plums enow; come, fool.
192 Ferna. Let slaves in mind be servile to their fears;
Our heart is high instarred in brighter spheres.
194
[Exeunt Fernando and Colona.]
196
Ros. I see him lost already.
198 If all prevail not, we shall know too late,
No toil can shun the violence of Fate. 

80
ACT V.
SCENE I.
The Palace: the Duchess's Bedchamber.
The curtain is drawn.
Bianca discovered in her night-attire, leaning on
a cushion at a table, holding Fernando by the hand.
Enter above Fiormonda.
1 Fiorm. [Aside]
2 Now fly, Revenge, and wound the lower earth,
That I, insphered above, may cross the race
4 Of love despised, and triumph o'er their graves
Who scorn the low-bent thraldom of my heart!
6
Bian. Why shouldst thou not be mine? why should the laws,
8 The iron laws of ceremony, bar
Mutual embraces? what's a vow? a vow?
10 Can there be sin in unity? could I
As well dispense with conscience as renounce
12 The outside of my titles, the poor style
Of duchess, I had rather change my life
14 With any waiting-woman in the land
To purchase one night's rest with thee, Fernando,
16 Than be Caraffa's spouse a thousand years.
18 Fiorm. [Aside]
Treason to wedlock! this would make you sweat.
20
Ferna. Lady of all…..as before,
22 .....what I am,....
To survive you, or I will see you first
24 Or widowèd or buried: if the last,
By all the comfort I can wish to taste,
26 By your fair eyes, that sepulchre that holds
Your coffin shall incoffin me alive;
28 I sign it with this seal.
30 [Kisses her.]
32 Fiorm. [Aside] Ignoble strumpet!
34 Bian. You shall not swear; take off that oath again,
Or thus I will enforce it.
36
[Kisses him.]

81
38
Ferna. Use that force,
40 And make me perjur[è]d; for whiles your lips
Are made the book, it is a sport to swear,
42 And glory to forswear.
44 Fiorm. [Aside] Here's fast and loose!
Which, for a ducat, now the game's on foot?
46
[Whilst they are kissing, enter the Duke
48 and D’Avolos, with their swords drawn,
followed by Petruchio, Nibrassa, and a Guard.]
50
Col. [Within] Help, help! madam, you are betrayed,
52 madam; help, help!
54 D’Av. [Aside to Duke] Is there confidence in credit,
now, sir? belief in your own eyes? do you see? do you
56 see, sir? can you behold it without lightning?
58 Col. [Within] Help, madam, help!
60 Ferna. What noise is that? I heard one cry.
62 Duke. [Comes forward] Ha, did you?
Know you who I am?
64
Ferna. Yes; th'art Pavy's duke,
66 Dressed like a hangman: see, I am unarmed,
Yet do not fear thee; though the coward doubt
68 Of what I could have done hath made thee steal
Th’ advantage of this time, yet, duke, I dare
70 Thy worst, for murder sits upon thy cheeks:
To't, man!
72
Duke. I am too angry in my rage
74 To scourge thee unprovided. − Take him hence;
Away with him!
76
[The Guard seize Fernando.]
78
Ferna. Unhand me!
80
D’Av. You must go, sir.
82
Ferna. Duke, do not shame thy manhood to lay hands
84 On that most innocent lady.
86 Duke. Yet again! −

82
Confine him to his chamber.
88
[Exeunt D’Avolos and the Guard with Fernando.]
90
 Leave us all;
92 None stay, not one; shut up the doors.
94 [Exeunt Petruchio and Nibrassa.]
96 Fiorm. Now shew thyself my brother, brave Caraffa.
98 Duke. Woman, stand forth before me; − wretched whore,
What canst thou hope for?
100
Bian. Death; I wish no less.
102 You told me you had dreamt; and, gentle duke,
Unless you be mistook, you are now awaked.
104
Duke. Strumpet, I am; and in my hand hold up
106 The edge that must uncut thy twist of life:
Dost thou not shake?
108
Bian. For what? to see a weak,
110 Faint, trembling arm advance a leaden blade?
Alas, good man! put up, put up; thine eyes
112 Are likelier much to weep than arms to strike:
What would you do now, pray?
114
Duke. What! shameless harlot!
116 Rip up the cradle of thy cursèd womb,
In which the mixture of that traitor's lust
118 Imposthumes for a birth of bastardy.
Yet come, and if thou think'st thou canst deserve
120 One mite of mercy, ere the boundless spleen
Of just-consuming wrath o'erswell my reason,
122 Tell me, bad woman, tell me what could move
Thy heart to crave variety of youth?
124
Bian. I'll tell ye, if you needs would be resolved;
126 I held Fernando much the properer man.
128 Duke. Shameless, intolerable whore!
130 Bian. What ails you?
Can you imagine, sir, the name of duke
132 Could make a crooked leg, a scambling foot,
A tolerable face, a wearish hand,
134 A bloodless lip, or such an untrimmed beard
As yours, fit for a lady's pleasure? no: 

83
136 I wonder you could think 'twere possible,
When I had once but looked on your Fernando,
138 I ever could love you again; fie, fie!
Now, by my life, I thought that long ago
140 Y' had known it, and been glad you had a friend
Your wife did think so well of.
142
Duke. O my stars!
144 Here's impudence above all history.
Why, thou detested reprobate in virtue,
146 Durst thou, without a blush, before mine eyes
Speak such immodest language?
148
Bian. Dare! yes, 'faith,
150 You see I dare: I know what you would say now;
You would fain tell me how exceeding much
152 I am beholding to you, that vouchsafed
Me, from a simple gentlewoman's place,
154 The honour of your bed: 'tis true, you did;
But why? 'twas but because you thought I had
156 A spark of beauty more than you had seen.
To answer this, my reason is the like;
158 The self-same appetite which led you on
To marry me led me to love your friend:
160 O, he's a gallant man! if ever yet
Mine eyes beheld a miracle composed
162 Of flesh and blood, Fernando has my voice.
I must confess, my lord, that, for a prince,
164 Handsome enough you are, and [− and] no more;
But to compare yourself with him! trust me,
166 You are too much in fault. Shall I advise you?
Hark in your ear; thank Heaven he was so slow
168 As not to wrong your sheets; for, as I live,
The fault was his, not mine.
170
Fiorm. Take this, take all.
172
Duke. Excellent, excellent! the pangs of death
174 Are music to this. −
Forgive me, my good genius; I had thought
176 I matched a woman, but I find she is
A devil, worser than the worst in hell. −
178 Nay, nay, since we are in, e'en come, say on;
I mark you to a syllable: you say
180 The fault was his, not yours; why, virtuous mistress,
Can you imagine you have so much art
182 Which may persuade me you and your close markman

84
Did not a little traffic in my right?
184
Bian. Look what I said, 'tis true; for, know it now, −
186 I must confess I missed no means, no time,
To win him to my bosom; but so much,
188 So holily, with such religiön,
He kept the laws of friendship, that my suit
190 Was held but, in comparison, a jest;
Nor did I ofter urge the violence
192 Of my affection, but as oft he urged
The sacred vows of faith 'twixt friend and friend:
194 Yet be assured, my lord, if ever language
Of cunning servile flatteries, entreaties,
196 Or what in me is, could procure his love,
I would not blush to speak it.
198
Duke. Such another
200 As thou art, miserable creature, would
Sink the whole sex of women: yet confess,
202 What witchcraft used the wretch to charm the [he]art
Of the once spotless temple of thy mind?
204 For without witchcraft it could ne'er be done.
206 Bian. Phew! − and you be in these tunes, sir, I'll leave;
You know the best and worst and all.
208
Duke. Nay, then,
210 Thou tempt'st me to thy ruin. Come, black angel,
Fair devil, in thy prayers reckon up
212 The sum in gross of all thy veinèd follies;
There, amongst others, weep in tears of blood
214 For one above the rest, adultery!
Adultery, Bianca! such a guilt
216 As, were the sluices of thine eyes let up,
Tears cannot wash it off: 'tis not the tide
218 Of trivial wantonness from youth to youth,
But thy abusing of thy lawful bed,
220 Thy husband's bed; his in whose breast thou sleep'st,
His that did prize thee more than all the trash
222 Which hoarding worldlings make an idol of.
When thou shalt find the catalogue enrolled
224 Of thy misdeeds, there shall be writ in text
Thy bastarding the issues of a prince.
226 Now turn thine eyes into thy hovering soul,
And do not hope for life; would angels sing
228 A requiem at my hearse but to dispense
With my revenge on thee, 'twere all in vain: 

85
230 Prepare to die!
232 Bian. [Opens her bosom] I do; and to the point
Of thy sharp sword with open breast I'll run
234 Half way thus naked; − do not shrink, Caraffa;
This daunts not me: but in the latter act
236 Of thy revenge, 'tis all the suit I ask
At my last gasp, to spare thy noble friend;
238 For life to me without him were a death.
240 Duke. Not this; I'll none of this; 'tis not so fit −
242 [Casts away his sword.]
244 Why should I kill her? she may live and change,
Or −
246
Fiorm. Dost thou halt? faint coward, dost thou wish
248 To blemish all thy glorious ancestors?
Is this thy courage?
250
Duke. Ha! say you so too? −
252 Give me thy hand, Bianca.
254 Bian. Here.
256 Duke. Farewell;
Thus go in everlasting sleep to dwell!
258
[The Duke draws his poniard and stabs her.]
260
Here's blood for lust, and sacrifice for wrong.
262
Bian. Tis bravely done; thou hast struck home at once:
264 Live to repent too late. Commend my love
To thy true friend, my love to him that owes it;
266 My tragedy to thee; my heart to − to − Fernando.
Oo − Oh!
268
[Bianca dies.]
270
Duke. Sister, she's dead.
272
Fiorm. Then, whiles thy rage is warm,
274 Pursue the causer of her trespasses.
276 Duke. Good:
I'll slake no time whiles I am hot in blood.
278

86
[Takes up his sword and exit.]
280
Fiorm. Here's royal vengeance! this becomes the state
282 Of his disgrace and my unbounded fate.
284 [Exit above.]

87
ACT V, SCENE II.
An Apartment in the Palace.
Enter Fernando, Nibrassa, and Petruchio.
1 Pet. [To Fernando]
2 May we give credit to your words, my lord?
Speak, on your honour.
4
Ferna. Let me die accursed,
6 If ever, through the progress of my life,
I did as much as reap the benefit
8 Of any favour from her save a kiss:
A better woman never blessed the earth.
10
Nib. Beshrew my heart, young lord, but I believe
12 thee: alas, kind lady, 'tis a lordship to a dozen
points but the jealous madman will in his fury
14 offer her some violence.
16 Pet. If it be thus, 'twere fit you rather kept
A guard about you for your own defence
18 Than to be guarded for security
Of his revenge; he is extremely moved.
20
Nib. Passion of my body, my lord, if 'a come in
22 his odd fits to you, in the case you are, he might
cut your throat ere you could provide a weapon
24 of defence: nay, rather than it shall be so, hold,
take my sword in your hand; 'tis none of the
26 sprucest, but 'tis a tough fox will not fail his
master, come what will come. Take it: I'll
28 answer't, I; in the mean time, Petruchio and I
will back to the duchess' lodging.
30
[Nibrassa gives Fernando his sword.]
32
Pet. Well thought on; − and, in despite of all his rage,
34 Rescue the virtuous lady.
36 Nib. Look to yourself, my lord! the duke comes.
38 Enter the Duke, his sword in one hand,
and a bloody dagger in the other.
40
Duke. Stand, and behold thy executioner,
42 Thou glorious traitor! I will keep no form 

88
Of ceremonious law to try thy guilt:
44 Look here, 'tis written on my poniard's point,
The bloody evidence of thy untruth,
46 Wherein thy conscience and the wrathful rod
Of Heaven's scourge for lust at once give up
48 The verdict of thy crying villainies.
I see th'art armed: prepare, I crave no odds
50 Greater than is the justice of my cause;
Fight, or I'll kill thee.
52
Ferna. Duke, I fear thee not:
54 But first I charge thee, as thou art a prince,
Tell me how hast thou used thy duchess?
56
Duke. How!
58 To add affliction to thy trembling ghost,
Look on my dagger's crimson dye, and judge.
60
Ferna. Not dead?
62
Duke. Not dead! yes, by my honour's truth: why, fool,
64 Dost think I'll hug my injuries? no, traitor!
I'll mix your souls together in your deaths,
66 As you did both your bodies in her life. −
Have at thee!
68
Ferna. Stay; I yield my weapon up.
70
[Fernando drops his sword and kneels.]
72
Here, here's my bosom: as thou art a duke,
74 Dost honour goodness, if the chaste Bianca
Be murthered, murther me.
76
Duke. Faint-hearted coward,
78 Art thou so poor in spirit! Rise and fight;
Or, by the glories of my house and name,
80 I'll kill thee basely.
82 Ferna. Do but hear me first:
Unfortunate Caraffa, thou hast butchered
84 An innocent, a wife as free from lust
As any terms of art can deify.
86
Duke. Pish, this is stale dissimulatiön;
88 I'll hear no more.
90 Ferna. If ever I unshrined 

89
The altar of her purity, or tasted
92 More of her love than what without control
Or blame a brother from a sister might,
94 Rack me to atomies. I must confess
I have too much abused thee; did exceed
96 In lawless courtship; 'tis too true, I did:
But, by the honour which I owe to goodness,
98 For any actual folly I am free.
100 Duke. 'Tis false: as much in death for thee she spake.
102 Ferna. By yonder starry roof, 'tis true. O duke!
Couldst thou rear up another world like this,
104 Another like to that, and more, or more,
Herein thou art most wretched; all the wealth
106 Of all those worlds could not redeem the loss
Of such a spotless wife. − Glorious Bianca,
108 Reign in the triumph of thy martyrdom;
Earth was unworthy of thee!
110
Nib. and Pet. Now, on our lives, we both believe him.
112
Duke. Fernando, dar'st thou swear upon my sword
114 To justify thy words?
116 Ferna. I dare; look here.
118 [Fernando kisses the sword.]
120 'Tis not the fear of death doth prompt my tongue,
For I would wish to die; and thou shalt know,
122 Poor miserable duke, since she is dead,
I'll hold all life a hell.
124
Duke. Bianca chaste!
126
Ferna. As virtue's self is good.
128
Duke. Chaste, chaste, and killed by me! to her
130 I offer up this remnant of my −
132 [The Duke offers to stab himself,
and is stayed by Fernando.]
134
Ferna. Hold!
136 Be gentler to thyself.
138 Pet. [To the Duke] Alas, my lord,
Is this a wise man's carriage? 

90
140
Duke. Whither now
142 Shall I run from the day, where never man,
Nor eye, nor eye of Heaven, may see a dog
144 So hateful as I am? Bianca chaste!
Had not the fury of some hellish rage
146 Blinded all reason's sight, I must have seen
Her clearness in her confidence to die.
148 Your leave −
150 [Kneels, holds up his hands, and,
after speaking to himself a little, rises.]
152
 'Tis done: come, friend, now for her love,
154 Her love that praised thee in the pangs of death,
I'll hold thee dear. − Lords, do not care for me,
156 I am too wise to die yet. − O, Bianca!
158 Enter D'Avolos.
160 D’Av. The Lord Abbot of Monaco, sir, is, in his
return from Rome, lodged last night late in the city,
162 very privately; and hearing the report of your
journey, only intends to visit your duchess to-morrow.
164
Duke. Slave, torture me no more! − note him, my lords;
166 If you would choose a devil in the shape
Of man, an arch-arch-devil, there stands one. −
168 We'll meet our uncle. − Order straight, Petruchio,
Our duchess may be coffined; 'tis our will
170 She forthwith be interred, with all the speed
And privacy you may, i' the college-church
172 Amongst Caraffa's ancient monuments:
Some three days hence we'll keep her funeral. −
174 Damned villain! bloody villain! − O, Bianca! −
No counsel from our cruël wills can win us;
176 But ills once done, we bear our guilt within us.
178 [Exeunt all but D'Avolos.]
180 D’Av. God boyee! "Arch-arch-devil!" why, I am
paid. Here's bounty for good service! beshrew my
182 heart, it is a right princely reward. Now must I say
my prayers, that I have lived to so ripe an age to
184 have my head stricken off. I cannot tell; 't may be
my Lady Fiormonda will stand on my behalf to
186 the duke: that's but a single hope; a disgraced
courtier oftener finds enemies to sink him when 

91
188 he is falling than friends to relieve him. I must
resolve to stand to the hazard of all brunts now.
190 Come what may, I will not die like a cow[ard];
and the world shall know it.
192
[Exit.]

92
ACT V, SCENE III.
Another Apartment in the Palace.
Enter Fiormonda, and Roseilli discovered.
1 Ros. Wonder not, madam; here behold the man
2 Whom your disdain hath metamorphosèd.
Thus long have I been clouded in this shape,
4 Led on by love; and in that love, despair:
If not the sight of our distracted court,
6 Nor pity of my bondage, can reclaim
The greatness of your scorn, yet let me know
8 My latest doom from you.
10 Fiorm. Strange miracle!
Roseilli, I must honour thee: thy truth,
12 Like a transparent mirror, represents
My reason with my errors. Noble lord,
14 That better dost deserve a better fate,
Forgive me: if my heart can entertain
16 Another thought of love, it shall be thine.
18 Ros. Blessèd, forever blessèd be the words!
In death you have revived me.
20
Enter D'Avolos.
22
D'Av. [Aside] Whom have we here? Roseilli,
24 the supposed fool? 'tis he; nay, then, help me
a brazen face! − My honourable lord! −
26
Ros. Bear off, bloodthirsty man! come not near me.
28
D'Av. Madam, I trust the service −
30
Fiorm. Fellow, learn to new-live: the way to thrift
32 For thee in grace is a repentant shrift.
34 Ros. Ill has thy life been, worse will be thy end:
Men fleshed in blood know seldom to amend.
36
Enter Servant.
38
Serv. [To Fiormonda] His highness commends his
40 love to you, and expects your presence; he is ready to
pass to the church, only staying for my lord abbot to
42 associate him. − Withal, his pleasure is, that you, 

93
D'Avolos, forbear to rank in this solemnity in the
44 place of secretary, else to be there as a private man. –
Pleaseth you to go?
46
[Exeunt all but D’Avolos.]
48
D'Av. As a private man! what remedy? This way
50 they must come; and here I will stand, to fall
amongst 'em in the rear,
52
[A sad sound of soft music.
54 The tomb is discovered.]
56 Enter four with torches, after them two Friars;
after, the Duke in mourning manner;
58 after him the Abbot, Flormonda, Colona, Julia,
Roseilli, Petruchio, Nibrassa, and a Guard. −
60 D'Avolos following behind. Coming near the tomb,
they all kneel, making shew of ceremony.
62 The Duke goes to the tomb, and lays his hand on it.
The music ceases.
64
Duke. Peace and sweet rest sleep here! Let not the touch
66 Of this my impious hand profane the shrine
Of fairest purity, which hovers yet
68 About those blessèd bones enhearsed within. −
If in the bosom of this sacred tomb,
70 Bianca, thy disturbèd ghost doth range,
Behold, I offer up the sacrifice
72 Of bleeding tears, shed from a faithful spring,
Roaring oblations of a mourning heart
74 To thee, offended spirit! I confess
I am Caraffa, he, that wretched man,
76 That butcher, who, in my enragèd spleen,
Slaughtered the life of innocence and beauty.
78 Now come I to pay tribute to those wounds
Which I digged up, and reconcile the wrongs
80 My fury wrought and my contrition mourns.
So chaste, so dear a wife, was never man
82 But I enjoyed; yet in the bloom and pride
Of all her years untimely took her life. −
84 Enough: set ope the tomb, that I may take
My last farewell, and bury griefs with her.
86
[The tomb is opened, out of which arises Fernando
88 in his winding-sheet, only his face discovered;
as the Duke is going in, Fernando puts him back.]

94
90
Ferna. Forbear! what art thou that dost rudely press
92 Into the confines of forsaken graves?
Has death no privilege? Com'st thou, Caraffa,
94 To practise yet a rape upon the dead?
Inhuman tyrant! −
96 Whats'ever thou intend[e]st, know this place
Is pointed out for my inheritance;
98 Here lies the monument of all my hopes:
Had eager lust intrunked my conquered soul,
100 I had not buried living joys in death.
Go, revel in thy palace, and be proud
102 To boast thy famous murthers; let thy smooth,
Low-fawning parasites renown thy act:
104 Thou com'st not here.
106 Duke. Fernando, man of darkness,
Never till now, before these dreadful sights,
108 Did I abhor thy friendship: thou hast robbed
My resolution of a glorious name.
110 Come out, or, by the thunder of my rage,
Thou die'st a death more fearful than the scourge
112 Of death can whip thee with.
114 Ferna. Of death? − poor duke!
Why, that's the aim I shoot at; 'tis not threats −
116 Maugre thy power, or the spite of hell −
Shall rent that honour: let life-hugging slaves,
118 Whose hands imbrued in butcheries like thine,
Shake terror to their souls, be loth to die!
120 See, I am clothed in robes that fit the grave:
I pity thy defiance.
122
Duke. Guard, lay hands,
124 And drag him out.
126 Ferna. Yes, let 'em; here's my shield;
128 [Fernando holds up a vial of poison.]
130 Here's health to victory!
132 [As the Guards go to seize him,
he drinks-off the vial.]
134
 Now do thy worst. −
136 Farewell, duke! once I have outstripped thy plots;
Not all the cunning antidotes of art
138 Can warrant me twelve minutes of my life: −

95
It works, it works already, bravely! bravely!
140 Now, now I feel it tear each several joint.
O royal poison! trusty friend! split, split
142 Both heart and gall asunder, excellent bane! −
Roseilli, love my memory. − Well searched out,
144 Swift, nimble venom! torture every vein. −
I come, Bianca − cruël torment, feast,
146 Feast on, do − Duke, farewell. − Thus I − hot flames! −
Conclude my love, − and seal it in my bosom!
148 Oh!
150 [Fernando dies.]
152 Abbot. Most desperate end!
154 Duke. None stir;
Who steps a foot steps to his utter ruin. −
156 And art thou gone, Fernando? art thou gone?
Thou wert a friend unmatched; rest in thy fame. −
158 Sister, when I have finished my last days,
Lodge me, my wife, and this unequalled friend,
160 All in one monument. − Now to my vows.
Never henceforth let any passionate tongue
162 Mention Bianca's and Caraffa's name,
But let each letter in that tragic sound
164 Beget a sigh, and every sigh a tear;
Children unborn, and widows whose lean cheeks
166 Are furrowed up by age, shall weep whole nights,
Repeating but the story of our fates;
168 Whiles in the period, closing up their tale,
They must conclude how for Bianca's love
170 Caraffa, in revenge of wrongs to her,
Thus on her altar sacrificed his life.
172
[Stabs himself.]
174
Abbot. O, hold the duke's hand!
176
Fiorm. Save my brother, save him!
178
Duke. Do, do; I was too willing to strike home
180 To be prevented. − Fools, why, could you dream
1 would outlive my outrage? − Sprightful flood,
182 Run out in rivers! O, that these thick streams
Could gather head, and make a standing pool,
184 That jealous husbands here might bathe in blood!
So! I grow sweetly empty; all the pipes
186 Of life unvessel life. − Now heavens, wipe out 

96
The writing of my sin! − Bianca, thus
188 I creep to thee − to thee − to thee, Bi−an−ca.
190 [Dies.]
192 Ros. He's dead already, madam.
194 D’Av. [Aside] Above hope! here's labour saved; I
could bless the Destinies.
196
Abbot. Would I had never seen it!
198
Fiorm. Since 'tis thus,
200 My Lord Roseilli, in the true requital
Of your continued love, I here possess
202 You of the dukedom, and with it of me.
In presence of this holy abbot.
204
Abbot. Lady, then,
206 From my hand take your husband; long enjoy
208 [Joins their hands.]
210 Each to each other's comfort and content!
212 All. Long live Roseilli!
214 Ros. First, thank[s] to Heaven; next, lady, to your love;
Lastly, my lords, to all: and that the entrance
216 Into this principality may give
Fair hopes of being worthy of our place,
218 Our first work shall be justice. − D'Avolos,
Stand forth.
220
D’Av. My gracious lord! −
222
Ros. No, graceless villain!
224 I am no lord of thine. − Guard, take him hence,
Convey him to the prison's top; in chains
226 Hang him alive; − whosoe'er lends a bit
Of bread to feed him dies. − Speak not against it,
228 I will be deaf to mercy. − Bear him hence!
230 D’Av. Mercy, new duke; − here's my comfort, I make
but one in the number of the tragedy of princes.
232
[D'Avolos is led off.]
234
Ros. Madam, a second charge is to perform
236 Your brother's testament; we'll rear a tomb 

97
To those unhappy lovers, which shall tell
238 Their fatal loves to all posterity. −
Thus, then, for you; henceforth I here dismiss
240 The mutual comforts of our marriage-bed:
Learn to new-live, my vows unmoved shall stand;
242 And since your life hath been so much uneven,
Bethink in time to make your peace with Heaven.
244
Fiorm. O, me! is this your love?
246
Ros. 'Tis your desert;
248 Which no persuasion shall remove.
250 Abbot. 'Tis fit;
Purge frailty with repentance.
252
Fiorm. I embrace it:
254 Happy too late, since lust hath made me foul,
Henceforth I'll dress my bride-bed in my soul.
256
Ros. Please you to walk, Lord Abbot?
258
Abbot. Yes, set on.
260 No age hath heard, nor chronicle can say,
That ever here befell a sadder day.
262
[Exeunt.]
