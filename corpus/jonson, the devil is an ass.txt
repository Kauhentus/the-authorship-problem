The Prologue.


    _The_ DIVELL _is an_ Asse. _That is, to day,
    The name of what you are met for, a new Play.
    Yet, Grandee’s, would you were not come to grace
    Our matter, with allowing vs no place.
    Though you presume_ SATAN _a subtill thing,                      5
    And may haue heard hee’s worne in a thumbe-ring;
    Doe not on these presumptions, force vs act,
    In compasse of a cheese-trencher. This tract
    Will ne’er admit our_ vice, _because of yours.
    Anone, who, worse then you, the fault endures                   10
    That your selues make? when you will thrust and spurne,
    And knocke vs o’ the elbowes, and bid, turne;
    As if, when wee had spoke, wee must be gone,
    Or, till wee speake, must all runne in, to one,
    Like the young adders, at the old ones mouth?                   15
    Would wee could stand due_ North; _or had no_ South,
    _If that offend: or were_ Muscouy _glasse,
    That you might looke our_ Scenes _through as they passe.
    We know not how to affect you. If you’ll come
    To see new Playes, pray you affoord vs roome,                   20
    And shew this, but the same face you haue done
    Your deare delight, the_ Diuell _of_ Edmunton.
    _Or, if, for want of roome it must mis-carry,
    ’Twill be but Iustice, that your censure tarry,
    Till you giue some. And when sixe times you ha’ seen’t,         25
    If this_ Play _doe not like, the Diuell is in’t._


THE DIVELL IS AN ASSE.  [95]


ACT. I. SCENE. I.


DIVELL.   PVG.   INIQVITY.

    Hoh, hoh, hoh, hoh, hoh, hoh, hoh, hoh, &c.
    To earth? and, why to earth, thou fooolish Spirit?
    What wold’st thou do on earth?

                           PVG. For that, great Chiefe!
    As time shal work. I do but ask my mon’th.
    Which euery petty _pui’nee Diuell_ has;                          5
    Within that terme, the Court of _Hell_ will heare
    Some thing, may gaine a longer grant, perhaps.

    SAT. For what? the laming a poore Cow, or two?
    Entring a Sow, to make her cast her farrow?
    Or crossing of a Mercat-womans Mare,                            10
    Twixt this, and _Totnam_? these were wont to be
    Your maine atchieuements, _Pug_, You haue some plot, now,
    Vpon a tonning of Ale, to stale the yest,
    Or keepe the churne so, that the buttter come not;
    Spight o’ the housewiues cord, or her hot spit?                 15
    Or some good Ribibe, about _Kentish_ Towne,
    Or _Hogsden_, you would hang now, for a witch,
    Because shee will not let you play round _Robbin_:
    And you’ll goe sowre the Citizens Creame ’gainst Sunday?
    That she may be accus’d for’t, and condemn’d,                   20
    By a _Middlesex_ Iury, to the satisfaction
    Of their offended friends, the _Londiners_ wiues
    Whose teeth were set on edge with it? Foolish feind,
    Stay i’ your place, know your owne strengths, and put not
    Beyond the spheare of your actiuity.                            25
    You are too dull a Diuell to be trusted                   [96]
    Forth in those parts, _Pug_, vpon any affayre
    That may concerne our name, on earth. It is not
    Euery ones worke. The state of _Hell_ must care
    Whom it imployes, in point of reputation,                       30
    Heere about _London_. You would make, I thinke
    An Agent, to be sent, for _Lancashire_,
    Proper inough; or some parts of _Northumberland_,
    So yo’ had good instructions, _Pug_.

                                        PVG. _O Chiefe!_
    You doe not know, deare _Chiefe_, what there is in mee.          35
    Proue me but for a fortnight, for a weeke,
    And lend mee but a _Vice_, to carry with mee,
    To practice there-with any play-fellow,
    And, you will see, there will come more vpon’t,
    Then you’ll imagine, pretious _Chiefe_.

                     SAT. What _Vice_?                              40
    What kind wouldst th’ haue it of?

                   PVG. Why, any _Fraud_;
    Or _Couetousnesse_; or Lady _Vanity_;
    Or old _Iniquity_: I’ll call him hither.

    INI. What is he, calls vpon me, and would seeme to lack a _Vice_?
    Ere his words be halfe spoken, I am with him in a trice;        45
    Here, there, and euery where, as the Cat is with the mice:
    True _vetus Iniquitas_. Lack’st thou Cards, friend, or Dice?
    I will teach thee cheate, Child, to cog, lye, and swagger,
    And euer and anon, to be drawing forth thy dagger:
    To sweare by Gogs-nownes, like a lusty _Iuuentus_,              50
    In a cloake to thy heele, and a hat like a pent-house.
    Thy breeches of three fingers, and thy doublet all belly,
    With a Wench that shall feede thee, with cock-stones and gelly.

    PVG. Is it not excellent, _Chiefe_? how nimble he is!

    INI. Child of hell, this is nothing! I will fetch thee a leape  55
    From the top of _Pauls_-steeple, to the Standard in _Cheepe_:
    And lead thee a daunce, through the streets without faile,
    Like a needle of _Spaine_, with a thred at my tayle.
    We will suruay the _Suburbs_, and make forth our sallyes,
    Downe _Petticoate-lane_, and vp the _Smock-allies_,             60
    To _Shoreditch_, _Whitechappell_, and so to Saint _Kathernes_.
    To drinke with the _Dutch_ there, and take forth their patternes:
    From thence, wee will put in at _Custome-house_ key there,
    And see, how the Factors, and Prentizes play there,
    False with their Masters; and gueld many a full packe,          65
    To spend it in pies, at the _Dagger_, and the _Wool-sacke_.

    PVG. Braue, braue, _Iniquity_! will not this doe, _Chiefe_?

    INI. Nay, boy, I wil bring thee to the Bawds, and the Roysters,
    At _Belins-gate_, feasting with claret-wine, and oysters,
    From thence shoot the _Bridge_, childe, to the Cranes
               i’ the _Vintry_,                                     70
    And see, there the gimblets, how they make their entry!
    Or, if thou hadst rather, to the _Strand_ downe to fall,
    ’Gainst the Lawyers come dabled from _Westminster-hall_   [97]
    And marke how they cling, with their clyents together,
    Like Iuie to Oake; so Veluet to Leather:                        75
    Ha, boy, I would shew thee.

             PVG. Rare, rare!

                             DIV. Peace, dotard,
    And thou more ignorant thing, that so admir’st.
    Art thou the spirit thou seem’st? so poore? to choose
    This, for a _Vice_, t’aduance the cause of _Hell_,
    Now? as Vice stands this present yeere? Remember,               80
    What number it is. _Six hundred_ and _sixteene_.
    Had it but beene _fiue hundred_, though some _sixty_
    Aboue; that’s _fifty_ yeeres agone, and _six_,
    (When euery great man had his _Vice_ stand by him,
    In his long coat, shaking his wooden dagger)                    85
    I could consent, that, then this your graue choice
    Might haue done that with his Lord _Chiefe_, the which
    Most of his chamber can doe now. But _Pug_,
    As the times are, who is it, will receiue you?
    What company will you goe to? or whom mix with?                 90
    Where canst thou carry him? except to Tauernes?
    To mount vp ona joynt-stoole, with a _Iewes_-trumpe,
    To put downe _Cokeley_, and that must be to Citizens?
    He ne’re will be admitted, there, where _Vennor_ comes.
    Hee may perchance, in taile of a Sheriffes dinner,              95
    Skip with a rime o’ the Table, from _New-nothing_,
    And take his _Almaine_-leape into a custard,
    Shall make my Lad _Maioresse_, and her sisters,
    Laugh all their hoods ouer their shoulders. But,
    This is not that will doe, they are other things               100
    That are receiu’d now vpon earth, for Vices;
    Stranger, and newer: and chang’d euery houre.
    They ride ’hem like their horses off their legges,
    And here they come to _Hell_, whole legions of ’hem,
    Euery weeke tyr’d. Wee, still striue to breed,                 105
    And reare ’hem vp new ones; but they doe not stand,
    When they come there: they turne ’hem on our hands.
    And it is fear’d they haue a stud o’ their owne
    Will put downe ours. Both our breed, and trade
    VVill suddenly decay, if we preuent not.                        110
    Vnlesse it be a _Vice_ of quality,
    Or fashion, now, they take none from vs. Car-men
    Are got into the yellow starch, and Chimney-sweepers
    To their tabacco, and strong-waters, _Hum_,
    _Meath_, and _Obarni_. VVe must therefore ayme                 115
    At extraordinary subtill ones, now,
    When we doe send to keepe vs vp in credit.
    Not old _Iniquities_. Get you e’ne backe, Sir,
    To making of your rope of sand againe.
    You are not for the manners, nor the times:             [98]   120
    They haue their _Vices_, there, most like to _Vertues_;
    You cannnot know ’hem, apart, by any difference:
    They weare the same clothes, eate the same meate,
    Sleepe i’ the selfe-same beds, rid i’ those coaches.
    Or very like, foure horses in a coach,                         125
    As the best men and women. Tissue gownes,
    Garters and roses, fourescore pound a paire,
    Embroydred stockings, cut-worke smocks, and shirts,
    More certaine marks of lechery, now, and pride,
    Then ere they were of true nobility!                           130
    But _Pug_, since you doe burne with such desire
    To doe the Common-wealth of Hell some seruice;
    I am content, assuming of a body,
    You goe to earth, and visit men, a day.
    But you must take a body ready made, _Pug_,                    135
    I can create you none: nor shall you forme
    Your selfe an aery one, but become subiect
    To all impression of the flesh, you take,
    So farre as humane frailty. So, this morning,
    There is a handsome Cutpurse hang’d at _Tiborne_,              140
    Whose spirit departed, you may enter his body:
    For clothes imploy your credit, with the Hangman,
    Or let our tribe of Brokers furnish you.
    And, looke, how farre your subtilty can worke
    Thorow those organs, with that body, spye                      145
    Amongst mankind, (you cannot there want vices,
    And therefore the lesse need to carry ’hem wi’ you)
    But as you make your soone at nights relation,
    And we shall find, it merits from the State,
    Your shall haue both trust from vs, and imployment.            150

    PVG. Most gracious _Chiefe_!

                 DIV. Onely, thus more I bind you,
    To serue the first man that you meete; and him
    I’le shew you, now: Obserue him. Yon’ is hee,
                _He shewes_ Fitz-dottrel _to him, comming forth_.
    You shall see, first, after your clothing. Follow him:
    But once engag’d, there you must stay and fixe;
    Not shift, vntill the midnights cocke doe crow.

    PVG. Any conditions to be gone.

                   DIV. Away, then.                                157


ACT. I. SCENE. II.

FITZ-DOTTRELL.

    I, they doe, now, name _Bretnor_, as before,              [97]
    They talk’d of _Gresham_, and of Doctor _Fore-man_,
    _Francklin_, and _Fiske_, and _Sauory_ (he was in too)
    But there’s not one of these, that euer could
    Yet shew a man the _Diuell_, in true sort.                       5
    They haue their christalls, I doe know, and rings,
    And virgin parchment, and their dead-mens sculls
    Their rauens wings, their lights, and _pentacles_,
    With _characters_; I ha’ seene all these. But--
    Would I might see the _Diuell_. I would giue                    10
    A hundred o’ these pictures, to see him
    Once out of picture. May I proue a cuckold,
    (And that’s the one maine mortall thing I feare)
    If I beginne not, now, to thinke, the Painters
    Haue onely made him. ’Slight, he would be seene,                15
    One time or other else. He would not let
    An ancient gentleman, of a good house,
    As most are now in _England_, the _Fitz-Dottrel’s_
    Runne wilde, and call vpon him thus in vaine,
    As I ha’ done this twelue mone’th. If he be not,                20
    At all, why, are there Coniurers? If they be not,
    Why, are there lawes against ’hem? The best artists
    Of _Cambridge_, _Oxford_, _Middlesex_, and _London_,
    _Essex_, and _Kent_, I haue had in pay to raise him,
    These fifty weekes, and yet h’appeares not. ’Sdeath,            25
    I shall suspect, they, can make circles onely
    Shortly, and know but his hard names. They doe say,
    H’will meet a man (of himselfe) that has a mind to him.
    If hee would so, I haue a minde and a halfe for him:
    He should not be long absent. Pray thee, come                   30
    I long for thee. An’ I were with child by him,
    And my wife too; I could not more. Come, yet,
                        _He expresses a longing to see the Diuell_
    Good _Beelezebub_. Were hee a kinde diuell,
    And had humanity in him, hee would come, but
    To saue ones longing. I should vse him well,                    35
    I sweare, and with respect (would he would try mee)
    Not, as the Conjurers doe, when they ha’ rais’d him.
    Get him in bonds, and send him post, on errands.
    A thousand miles, it is preposterous, that;              [100]
    And I beleeue, is the true cause he comes not.                  40
    And hee has reason. Who would be engag’d,
    That might liue freely, as he may doe? I sweare,
    They are wrong all. The burn’t child dreads the fire.
    They doe not know to entertaine the _Diuell_.
    I would so welcome him, obserue his diet,                       45
    Get him his chamber hung with _arras_, two of ’hem,
    I’ my own house; lend him my wiues wrought pillowes:
    And as I am an honest man, I thinke,
    If he had a minde to her, too; I should grant him,
    To make our friend-ship perfect. So I would not                 50
    To euery man. If hee but heare me, now?
    And should come to mee in a braue young shape,
    And take me at my word? ha! Who is this?




ACT. I. SCENE. IIJ.

PVG.   FITZ-DOTTRELL.

    Sir, your good pardon, that I thus presume
    Vpon your priuacy. I am borne a Gentleman,
    A younger brother; but, in some disgrace,
    Now, with my friends: and want some little meanes,
    To keepe me vpright, while things be reconcil’d.                 5
    Please you, to let my seruice be of vse to you, Sir.

    FIT. Seruice? ’fore hell, my heart was at my mouth,
    Till I had view’d his shooes well: for, those roses
    Were bigge inough to hide a clouen foote.
                _Hee lookes and suruay’s his feet: ouer and ouer._
    No, friend, my number’s full. I haue one seruant,               10
    Who is my all, indeed; and, from the broome
    Vnto the brush: for, iust so farre, I trust him.
    He is my Ward-robe man, my Cater, Cooke,
    Butler, and Steward; lookes vnto my horse:
    And helpes to watch my wife. H’has all the places,              15
    That I can thinke on, from the garret downward,
    E’en to the manger, and the curry-combe.

    PVG. Sir, I shall put your worship to no charge,
    More then my meate, and that but very little,
    I’le serue you for your loue.

                               FIT. Ha? without wages?              20
    I’le harken o’ that eare, were I at leasure.
    But now, I’m busie. ’Pr’y the, friend forbeare mee,
    And’ thou hadst beene a _Diuell_, I should say             [101]
    Somewhat more to thee. Thou dost hinder, now,
    My meditations.

           PVG. Sir, I am a _Diuell_. 25

    FIT. How!

           PVG. A true _Diuell_, S^r.

                               FIT. Nay, now, you ly:
    Vnder your fauour, friend, for, I’ll not quarrell.
    I look’d o’ your feet, afore, you cannot coozen mee,
    Your shoo’s not clouen, Sir, you are whole hoof’d.
                                    _He viewes his feete againe._
    PVG. Sir, that’s a popular error, deceiues many:                30
    But I am that, I tell you.

           FIT. What’s your name?

    PVG. My name is _Diuell_, S^r.

           FIT. Sai’st thou true.

                   PVG. in-deed, S^r.

    FIT. ’Slid! there’s some _omen_ i’ this! what countryman?

    PVG. Of _Derby-shire_, S^r. about the _Peake_.

                  FIT. That Hole
    Belong’d to your Ancestors?

                    PVG. Yes, _Diuells_ arse, S^r.                  35

    FIT. I’ll entertaine him for the name sake. Ha?
    And turne away my tother man? and saue
    Foure pound a yeere by that? there’s lucke, and thrift too!
    The very _Diuell_ may come, heereafter, as well.
    Friend, I receiue you: but (withall) I acquaint you,            40
    Aforehand, if yo’ offend mee, I must beat you.
    It is a kinde of exercise, I vse.
    And cannot be without.

          PVG. Yes, if I doe not
    Offend, you can, sure.

                  FIT. Faith, _Diuell_, very hardly:
    I’ll call you by your surname, ’cause I loue it.                45



ACT. I. SCENE. IIII.

INGINE.   WITTIPOL.   MANLY.
   FITZDOTTRELL.   PVG.

    Yonder hee walkes, Sir, I’ll goe lift him for you.

    WIT. To him, good _Ingine_, raise him vp by degrees,
    Gently, and hold him there too, you can doe it.
    Shew your selfe now, a _Mathematicall_ broker.

    ING. I’ll warrant you for halfe a piece.

                 WIT. ’Tis done, S^r.                                5

    MAN. Is’t possible there should be such a man?

    WIT. You shall be your owne witnesse, I’ll not labour
    To tempt you past your faith.

           MAN. And is his wife
    So very handsome, say you?

                        WIT. I ha’ not seene her,
    Since I came home from trauell: and they say,                   10
    Shee is not alter’d. Then, before I went,
    I saw her once; but so, as shee hath stuck
    Still i’ my view, no obiect hath remou’d her.

    MAN. ’Tis a faire guest, Friend, beauty: and once lodg’d  [102]
    Deepe in the eyes, shee hardly leaues the Inne.                 15
    How do’s he keepe her?

                         WIT. Very braue. Howeuer,
    Himselfe be fordide, hee is sensuall that way.
    In euery dressing, hee do’s study her.

    MAN. And furnish forth himselfe so from the _Brokers_?

    WIT. Yes, that’s a hyr’d suite, hee now has one,                20
    To see the _Diuell_ is an _Asse_, to day, in:
    (This _Ingine_ gets three or foure pound a weeke by him)
    He dares not misse a new _Play_, or a _Feast_,
    What rate soeuer clothes be at; and thinkes
    Himselfe still new, in other mens old.

           MAN. But stay,                                           25
    Do’s he loue meat so?

               WIT. Faith he do’s not hate it.
    But that’s not it. His belly and his palate
    Would be compounded with for reason. Mary,
    A wit he has, of that strange credit with him,
    ’Gainst all mankinde; as it doth make him doe                   30
    Iust what it list: it rauishes him forth,
    Whither it please, to any assembly’or place,
    And would conclude him ruin’d, should hee scape
    One publike meeting, out of the beliefe
    He has of his owne great, and Catholike strengths,              35
    In arguing, and discourse. It takes, I see:
    H’has got the cloak vpon him.

         Ingine _hath won_ Fitzdottrel, _to ’say on the cloake_.

      FIT. A faire garment,
    By my faith, _Ingine_!

                             ING. It was neuer made, Sir,
    For three score pound, I assure you: ’Twill yeeld thirty.
    The plush, Sir, cost three pound, ten shillings a yard!         40
    And then the lace, and veluet.

                         FIT. I shall, _Ingine_,
    Be look’d at, pretitly, in it! Art thou sure
    The _Play_ is play’d to day?

           ING. O here’s the bill, S^r.
                              _Hee giues him the_ Play-_bill_.
    I’, had forgot to gi’t you.

                         FIT. Ha? the _Diuell_!
    I will not lose you, Sirah! But, _Ingine_, thinke you,          45
    The Gallant is so furious in his folly?
    So mad vpon the matter, that hee’ll part
    With’s cloake vpo’ these termes?

                 ING. Trust not your _Ingine_,
    Breake me to pieces else, as you would doe
    A rotten _Crane_, or an old rusty _Iacke_,                      50
    That has not one true wheele in him. Doe but talke with him.

    FIT. I shall doe that, to satisfie you, _Ingine_,
    And my selfe too. With your leaue, Gentlemen.
                                     _Hee turnes to_ Wittipol.
    Which of you is it, is so meere Idolater
    To my wiues beauty, and so very prodigall                       55
    Vnto my patience, that, for the short parlee?
    Of one swift houres quarter, with my wife,
    He will depart with (let mee see) this cloake here
    The price of folly? Sir, are you the man?

    WIT. I am that vent’rer, Sir.

          FIT. Good time! your name                                 60
    Is _Witty-pol_?

           WIT. The same, S^r.

                FIT. And ’tis told me,                       [103]
    Yo’ haue trauell’d lately?

                     WIT. That I haue, S^r.

                               FIT. Truly,
    Your trauells may haue alter’d your complexion;
    But sure, your wit stood still.

          WIT. It may well be, Sir.
    All heads ha’ not like growth.

                          FIT. The good mans grauity,               65
    That left you land, your father, neuer taught you
    These pleasant matches?

          WIT. No, nor can his mirth,
    With whom I make ’hem, put me off.

       FIT. You are
    Resolu’d then?

            WIT. Yes, S^r.

                        FIT. Beauty is the _Saint_,
    You’ll sacrifice your selfe, into the shirt too?                70

    WIT. So I may still cloth, and keepe warme your wisdome?

    FIT. You lade me S^r!

           WIT. I know what you wil beare, S^r.

    FIT. Well, to the point. ’Tis only, Sir, you say,
    To speake vnto my wife?

            WIT. Only, to speake to her.

    FIT. And in my presence?

            WIT. In your very presence.                             75

    FIT. And in my hearing?

            WIT. In your hearing: so,
    You interrupt vs not.

                     FIT. For the short space
    You doe demand, the fourth part of an houre,
    I thinke I shall, with some conuenient study,
    And this good helpe to boot, bring my selfe to’t.               80

                           _Hee shrugs himselfe vp in the cloake._

    WIT. I aske no more.

               FIT. Please you, walk to’ard my house,
    Speake what you list; that time is yours: My right
    I haue departed with. But, not beyond,
    A minute, or a second, looke for. Length,
    And drawing out, ma’aduance much, to these matches.             85
    And I except all kissing. Kisses are
    Silent petitions still with willing _Louers_.

    WIT. _Louers?_ How falls that o’ your phantsie?

                             FIT. Sir.
    I doe know somewhat. I forbid all lip-worke.

    WIT. I am not eager at forbidden dainties.                      90
    Who couets vnfit things, denies him selfe.

    FIT. You say well, Sir, ’Twas prettily said, that same,
    He do’s, indeed. I’ll haue no touches, therefore,
    Nor takings by the armes, nor tender circles
    Cast ’bout the wast, but all be done at distance.               95
    Loue is brought vp with those soft _migniard_ handlings;
    His pulse lies in his palme: and I defend
    All melting ioynts, and fingers, (that’s my bargaine)
    I doe defend ’hem, any thing like action.
    But talke, Sir, what you will. Vse all the _Tropes_            100
    And _Schemes_, that Prince _Quintilian_ can afford you:
    And much good do your _Rhetoriques_ heart. You are welcome, Sir.
    _Ingine_, God b’w’you.

              WIT. Sir, I must condition
    To haue this Gentleman by, a witnesse.

               FIT. Well,
    I am content, so he be silent.

                  MAN. Yes, S r.                                   105

    FIT. Come _Diuell_, I’ll make you roome, streight.
    But I’ll shew you
    First, to your Mistresse, who’s no common one,
    You must conceiue, that brings this game to see her.      [104]
    I hope thou’st brought me good lucke.

                PVG. I shall do’t. Sir.



ACT. I. SCENE. V.

VVITTIPOL.   MANLY.

    _Ingine_, you hope o’ your halfe piece? ’Tis there, Sir.
    Be gone. Friend _Manly_, who’s within here? fixed?

                      Wittipol _knocks his friend o’ the brest_.

    MAN. I am directly in a fit of wonder
    What’ll be the issue of this conference!

    WIT. For that, ne’r vex your selfe, till the euent.              5
    How like yo’ him?

          MAN. I would faine see more of him.

    WIT. What thinke you of this?

          MAN. I am past degrees of thinking.
    Old _Africk_, and the new _America_,
    With all their fruite of Monsters cannot shew
    So iust a prodigie.

                    WIT. Could you haue beleeu’d,                   10
    Without your sight, a minde so sordide inward,
    Should be so specious, and layd forth abroad,
    To all the shew, that euer shop, or ware was?

    MAN. I beleeue any thing now, though I confesse
    His _Vices_ are the most extremities                            15
    I euer knew in nature. But, why loues hee
    The _Diuell_ so?

                 WIT. O S^r! for hidden treasure,
    Hee hopes to finde: and has propos’d himselfe
    So infinite a Masse, as to recouer,
    He cares not what he parts with, of the present,                20
    To his men of Art, who are the race, may coyne him.
    Promise gold-mountaines, and the couetous
    Are still most prodigall.

            MAN. But ha’ you faith,
    That he will hold his bargaine?

                           WIT. O deare, Sir!
    He will not off on’t. Feare him not. I know him.                25
    One basenesse still accompanies another.
    See! he is heere already, and his wife too.

    MAN. A wondrous handsome creature, as I liue!

FITZ-DOTTRELL.    Mistresse FITZ-DOTTRELL.
      WITTIPOL.   MANLY.

    Come wife, this is the Gentleman. Nay, blush not.

    M^rs. FI. Why, what do you meane Sir? ha’ you your reason?

                                  FIT. Wife,
    I do not know, that I haue lent it forth
    To any one; at least, without a pawne, wife:
    Or that I’haue eat or drunke the thing, of late,                 5
    That should corrupt it. Wherefore gentle wife,
    Obey, it is thy vertue: hold no acts
    Of disputation.

                         M^rs. FI. Are you not enough
    The talke, of feasts, and meetingy, but you’ll still
    Make argument for fresh?

                      FIT. Why, carefull wedlocke,                  10
    If I haue haue a longing to haue one tale more
    Goe of mee, what is that to thee, deare heart?
    Why shouldst thou enuy my delight? or crosse it?
    By being solicitous, when it not concernes thee?

    M^rs. FI. Yes, I haue share in this. The scorne will fall       15
    As bittterly on me, where both are laught at.

    FIT. Laught at, sweet bird? is that the scruple? Come, come,
    Thou art a _Niaise_.
          _A_ Niaise _is a young Hawke, tane crying out of the nest._
                    Which of your great houses,
    (I will not meane at home, here, but abroad)
    Your families in _France_, wife, send not forth                 20
    Something, within the seuen yeere, may be laught at?
    I doe not say seuen moneths, nor seuen weekes,
    Nor seuen daies, nor houres: but seuen yeere wife.
    I giue ’hem time. Once, within seuen yeere,
    I thinke they may doe something may be laught at.               25
    In _France_, I keepe me there, still. Wherefore, wife,
    Let them that list, laugh still, rather then weepe
    For me; Heere is a cloake cost fifty pound, wife,
    Which I can sell for thirty, when I ha’ seene
    All _London_ in’t, and _London_ has seene mee.                  30
    To day, I goe to the _Black-fryers Play-house_,
    Sit ithe view, salute all my acquaintance,
    Rise vp betweene the _Acts_, let fall my cloake,
    Publish a handsome man, and a rich suite
    (As that’s a speciall end, why we goe thither,                  35
    All that pretend, to stand for’t o’ the _Stage_)
    The Ladies aske who’s that? (For, they doe come         [106]
    To see vs, _Loue_, as wee doe to see them)
    Now, I shall lose all this, for the false feare
    Of being laught at? Yes, wusse. Let ’hem laugh, wife,           40
    Let me haue such another cloake to morrow.
    And let ’hem laugh againe, wife, and againe,
    And then grow fat with laughing, and then fatter,
    All my young Gallants, let ’hem bring their friends too:
    Shall I forbid ’hem? No, let heauen forbid ’hem:                45
    Or wit, if’t haue any charge on ’hem. Come, thy eare, wife,
    Is all, I’ll borrow of thee. Set your watch, Sir,
    Thou, onely art to heare, not speake a word, _Doue_,
    To ought he sayes. That I doe gi’ you in precept,
    No lesse then councell, on your wiue-hood, wife,                50
    Not though he flatter you, or make court, or _Loue_
    (As you must looke for these) or say, he raile;
    What ere his arts be, wife, I will haue thee
    Delude ’hem with a trick, thy obstinate silence;
    I know aduantages; and I loue to hit                            55
    These pragmaticke young men, at their owne weapons.
    Is your watch ready? Here my saile beares, for you:
    Tack toward him, sweet _Pinnace_, where’s your watch?

            _He disposes his wife to his place, and sets his watch._

    WIT. I’le set it. Sir, with yours.

                 M^rs. FI. I must obey.

    MAN. Her modesty seemes to suffer with her beauty,              60
    And so, as if his folly were away,
    It were worth pitty.

              FIT. Now, th’are right, beginne, Sir.
    But first, let me repeat the contract, briefely.
                               _Hee repeats his contract againe._
    I am, Sir, to inioy this cloake, I stand in,
    Freely, and as your gift; vpon condition                        65
    You may as freely, speake here to my spouse,
    Your quarter of an houre alwaies keeping
    The measur’d distance of your yard, or more,
    From my said Spouse: and in my sight and hearing.
    This is your couenant?

             WIT. Yes, but you’ll allow                             70
    For this time spent, now?

                  FIT. Set ’hem so much backe.

    WIT. I thinke, I shall not need it.

                          FIT. Well, begin, Sir,
    There is your bound, Sir. Not beyond that rush.

    WIT. If you interrupt me, Sir, I shall discloake you.
                                             Wittipol _beginnes_.
    The time I haue purchast, Lady, is but short;                   75
    And, therefore, if I imploy it thriftily,
    I hope I stand the neerer to my pardon.
    I am not here, to tell you, you are faire,
    Or louely, or how well you dresse you, Lady,
    I’ll saue my selfe that eloquence of your glasse,               80
    Which can speake these things better to you then I.
    And ’tis a knowledge, wherein fooles may be
    As wise as a _Count Parliament_. Nor come I,
    With any preiudice, or doubt, that you                  [107]
    Should, to the notice of your owne worth, neede                 85
    Least reuelation. Shee’s a simple woman,
    Know’s not her good: (who euer knowes her ill)
    And at all caracts. That you are the wife,
    To so much blasted flesh, as scarce hath soule,
    In stead of salt, to keepe it sweete; I thinke,                 90
    Will aske no witnesses, to proue. The cold
    Sheetes that you lie in, with the watching candle,
    That sees, how dull to any thaw of beauty,
    Pieces, and quarters, halfe, and whole nights, sometimes,
    The Diuell-giuen _Elfine_ Squire, your husband,                 95
    Doth leaue you, quitting heere his proper circle,
    For a much-worse i’ the walks of _Lincolnes Inne_,
    Vnder the Elmes, t’expect the feind in vaine, there
    Will confesse for you.

           FIT. I did looke for this geere.

    WIT. And what a daughter of darknesse, he do’s make you,       100
    Lock’d vp from all society, or object;
    Your eye not let to looke vpon a face,
    Vnder a Conjurers (or some mould for one,
    Hollow, and leane like his) but, by great meanes,
    As I now make; your owne too sensible sufferings,              105
    Without the extraordinary aydes,
    Of spells, or spirits, may assure you, Lady.
    For my part, I protest ’gainst all such practice,
    I worke by no false arts, medicines, or charmes
    To be said forward and backward.

            FIT. No, I except:                                     110

    WIT. Sir I shall ease you.

                                   _He offers to discloake him._

            FIT. Mum.

                       WIT. Nor haue I ends, Lady,
    Vpon you, more then this: to tell you how _Loue_
    Beauties good Angell, he that waits vpon her
    At all occasions, and no lesse then _Fortune_,
    Helps th’ aduenturous, in mee makes that proffer,              115
    Which neuer faire one was so fond, to lose;
    Who could but reach a hand forth to her freedome:
    On the first sight, I lou’d you: since which time,
    Though I haue trauell’d, I haue beene in trauell
    More for this second blessing of your eyes                     120
    Which now I’haue purchas’d, then for all aymes else.
    Thinke of it, Lady, be your minde as actiue,
    As is your beauty: view your object well.
    Examine both my fashion, and my yeeres;
    Things, that are like, are soone familiar:                     125
    And Nature ioyes, still in equality.
    Let not the signe o’ the husband fright you, Lady.
    But ere your spring be gone, inioy it. Flowers,
    Though faire, are oft but of one morning. Thinke,
    All beauty doth not last vntill the _autumne_.                 130
    You grow old, while I tell you this. And such,          [108]
    As cannot vse the present, are not wise.
    If Loue and Fortune will take care of vs,
    Why should our will be wanting? This is all.
    What doe you answer, Lady?

                                        _Shee stands mute._

                       FIT. Now, the sport comes.                  135
    Let him still waite, waite, waite: while the watch goes,
    And the time runs. Wife!

                       WIT. How! not any word?
    Nay, then, I taste a tricke in’t. Worthy Lady,
    I cannot be so false to mine owne thoughts
    Of your presumed goodnesse, to conceiue                        140
    This, as your rudenesse, which I see’s impos’d.
    Yet, since your cautelous _Iaylor_, here stands by you,
    And yo’ are deni’d the liberty o’ the house,
    Let me take warrant, Lady, from your silence,
    (Which euer is interpreted consent)                            145
    To make your answer for you: which shall be
    To as good purpose, as I can imagine,
    And what I thinke you’ld speake.

             FIT. No, no, no, no.

    WIT. I shall resume, S^r.

             MAN. Sir, what doe you meane?

                  _He sets_ M^r. Manly, _his friend, in her place_.

    WIT. One interruption more, Sir, and you goe                   150
    Into your hose and doublet, nothing saues you.
    And therefore harken. This is for your wife.

    MAN. You must play faire, S^r.

                   WIT. Stand for mee, good friend.
                                           _And speaks for her._
    Troth, Sir, tis more then true, that you haue vttred
    Of my vnequall, and so sordide match heere,                    155
    With all the circumstances of my bondage.
    I haue a husband, and a two-legg’d one,
    But such a moon-ling, as no wit of man
    Or roses can redeeme from being an Asse.
    H’is growne too much, the story of mens mouthes,               160
    To scape his lading: should I make’t my study,
    And lay all wayes, yea, call mankind to helpe,
    To take his burden off, why, this one act
    Of his, to let his wife out to be courted,
    And, at a price, proclaimes his asinine nature                 165
    So lowd, as I am weary of my title to him.
    But Sir, you seeme a Gentleman of vertue,
    No lesse then blood; and one that euery way
    Lookes as he were of too good quality,
    To intrap a credulous woman, or betray her:                    170
    Since you haue payd thus deare, Sir, for a visit,
    And made such venter, on your wit, and charge
    Meerely to see mee, or at most to speake to mee,
    I were too stupid; or (what’s worse) ingrate
    Not to returne your venter. Thinke, but how,                   175
    I may with safety doe it; I shall trust
    My loue and honour to you, and presume;
    You’ll euer husband both, against this husband;        [109]
    Who, if we chance to change his liberall eares,
    To other ensignes, and with labour make                        180
    A new beast of him, as hee shall deserue,
    Cannot complaine, hee is vnkindly dealth with.
    This day hee is to goe to a new play, Sir.
    From whence no feare, no, nor authority,
    Scarcely the _Kings_ command, Sir, will restraine him,         185
    Now you haue fitted him with a _Stage_-garment,
    For the meere names sake, were there nothing else:
    And many more such iourneyes, hee will make.
    Which, if they now, or, any time heereafter,
    Offer vs opportunity, you heare, Sir,                          190
    Who’ll be as glad, and forward to imbrace,
    Meete, and enioy it chearefully as you.
    I humbly thanke you, Lady.

                       _Hee shifts to his owne place againe_

              FIT. Keepe your ground Sir.

    WIT. Will you be lightned?

              FIT. Mum.

                                    WIT. And but I am,
    By the sad contract, thus to take my leaue of you              195
    At this so enuious distance, I had taught
    Our lips ere this, to seale the happy mixture
    Made of our soules. But we must both, now, yeeld
    To the necessity. Doe not thinke yet, Lady,
    But I can kisse, and touch, and laugh, and whisper,            200
    And doe those crowning court-ships too, for which,
    Day, and the publike haue allow’d no name
    But, now, my bargaine binds me. ’Twere rude iniury,
    T’importune more, or vrge a noble nature,
    To what of it’s owne bounty it is prone to:                    205
    Else, I should speake--But, Lady, I loue so well,
    As I will hope, you’ll doe so to. I haue done, Sir.

    FIT. Well, then, I ha’ won?

               WIT. Sir, And I may win, too.

    FIT. O yes! no doubt on’t. I’ll take carefull order,
    That shee shall hang forth ensignes at the window,             210
    To tell you when I am absent. Or I’ll keepe
    Three or foure foote-men, ready still of purpose,
    To runne and fetch you, at her longings, Sir.
    I’ll goe bespeake me straight a guilt caroch,
    For her and you to take the ayre in. Yes,                      215
    Into _Hide-parke_, and thence into _Black-Fryers_,
    Visit the painters, where you may see pictures,
    And note the properest limbs, and how to make ’hem.
    Or what doe you say vnto a middling Gossip
    To bring you aye together, at her lodging?                     220
    Vnder pretext of teaching o’ my wife
    Some rare receit of drawing _almond_ milke? ha?
    It shall be a part of my care. Good Sir, God b’w’you.
    I ha’ kept the contract, and the cloake is mine.

    WIT. Why, much good do’t you S^r; it may fall out,     [110]   225
    That you ha’ bought it deare, though I ha’ not sold it.

    FIT. A pretty riddle! Fare you well, good Sir.
    Wife, your face this way, looke on me: and thinke
    Yo’ haue had a wicked dreame, wife, and forget it.

                                     _Hee turnes his wife about._

    MAN. This is the strangest motion I ere saw.                   230

    FIT. Now, wife, sits this faire cloake the worse vpon me,
    For my great sufferings, or your little patience? ha?
    They laugh, you thinke?

                 M^rs. FI. Why S^r. and you might see’t.
    What thought, they haue of you, may be soone collected
    By the young Genlemans speache.

                               FIT. Youug Gentleman?               235
    Death! you are in loue with him, are you? could he not
    Be nam’d the Gentleman, without the young?
    Vp to your Cabbin againe.

         M^rs. FI. My cage, yo’ were best
    To call it?

            FIT. Yes, sing there. You’ld faine be making
    _Blanck Manger_ with him at your mothers! I know you.          240
    Goe get you vp. How now! what say you, _Diuell_?

PVG.   FITZDOTTREL.   INGINE.

    Heere is one _Ingine_, Sir, desires to speake with you.

    FIT. I thought he brought some newes, of a broker! Well,
    Let him come in, good _Diuell_: fetch him else.
    O, my fine _Ingine_! what’s th’affaire? more cheats?

    ING. No Sir, the Wit, the Braine, the great _Proiector_,         5
    I told you of, is newly come to towne.

    FIT. Where, _Ingine_?

                  ING. I ha’ brought him (H’is without)
    Ere hee pull’d off his boots, Sir, but so follow’d,
    For businesses:

         FIT. But what is a _Proiector_?
    I would conceiue.

                 ING. Why, one Sir, that proiects                   10
    Wayes to enrich men, or to make ’hem great,
    By suites, by marriages, by vndertakings:
    According as he sees they humour it.

    FIT. Can hee not coniure at all?

                         ING. I thinke he can, Sir.
    (To tell you true) but, you doe know, of late,                  15
    The State hath tane such note of ’hem, and compell’d ’hem,
    To enter such great bonds, they dare not practice.

    FIT. ’Tis true, and I lie fallow for’t, the while!

    ING. O, Sir! you’ll grow the richer for the rest.

    FIT. I hope I shall: but _Ingine_, you doe talke                20
    Somewhat too much, o’ my courses. My Cloake-customer
    Could tell mee strange particulars.

                         ING. By my meanes?                 [111]

    FIT. How should he haue ’hem else?

                             ING. You do not know, S^r,
    What he has: and by what arts! A monei’d man, Sir,
    And is as great with your _Almanack-Men_, as you are!           25

    FIT. That Gallant?

            ING. You make the other wait too long, here:
    And hee is extreme punctuall.

                  FIT. Is he a gallant?

    ING. Sir, you shall see: He’is in his riding suit,
    As hee comes now from Court. But heere him speake:
    Minister matter to him, and then tell mee.                      30

    Sir, money’s a whore, a bawd, a drudge;
    Fit to runne out on errands: Let her goe.
    _Via pecunia!_ when she’s runne and gone,
    And fled and dead; then will I fetch her, againe,
    With _Aqua-vitæ_, out of an old Hogs-head!                       5
    While there are lees of wine, or dregs of beere,
    I’le neuer want her! Coyne her out of cobwebs,
    Dust, but I’ll haue her! Raise wooll vpon egge-shells,
    Sir, and make grase grow out o’ marro-bones.
    To make her come. (Commend mee to your Mistresse,               10
                                           _To a waiter._
    Say, let the thousand pound but be had ready,
    And it is done) I would but see the creature
    (Of flesh, and blood) the man, the _prince_, indeed,
    That could imploy so many millions
    As I would help him to.

                      FIT. How, talks he? millions?                 15

    MER. (I’ll giue you an account of this to morrow.)
    Yes, I will talke no lesse, and doe it too;
                                               _To another._
    If they were _Myriades_: and without the _Diuell_,
    By direct meanes, it shall be good in law.

                          ING. Sir.                        [112]

    MER. Tell M^r. _Wood-cock_, I’ll not faile to meet him          20
                                                   _To a third._
    Vpon th’ _Exchange_ at night. Pray him to haue
    The writings there, and wee’ll dispatch it. Sir,
                                    _He turnes to_ Fitz-dottrel.
    You are a Gentleman of a good presence,
    A handsome man (I haue considered you)
    As a fit stocke to graft honours vpon:                          25
    I haue a proiect to make you a _Duke_, now.
    That you must be one, within so many moneths,
    As I set downe, out of true reason of state,
    You sha’ not auoyd it. But you must harken, then.

    ING. Harken? why S^r, do you doubt his eares? Alas!             30
    You doe not know Master _Fitz-dottrel_.

    FIT. He do’s not know me indeed. I thank you, _Ingine_,
    For rectifying him.

                   MER. Good! Why, _Ingine_, then
                                         _He turnes to_ Ingine.
    I’le tell it you. (I see you ha’ credit, here,
    And, that you can keepe counsell, I’ll not question.)           35
    Hee shall but be an vndertaker with mee,
    In a most feasible bus’nesse. It shall cost him
    Nothing.

         ING. Good, S^r.

           MER. Except he please, but’s count’nance;
    (That I will haue) t’appeare in’t, to great men,
    For which I’ll make him one. Hee shall not draw                 40
    A string of’s purse. I’ll driue his pattent for him.
    We’ll take in Cittizens, _Commoners_, and _Aldermen_,
    To beare the charge, and blow ’hem off againe,
    Like so many dead flyes, when ’tis carryed.
    The thing is for recouery of drown’d land,                      45
    Whereof the _Crowne’s_ to haue his moiety,
    If it be owner; Else, the _Crowne_ and Owners
    To share that moyety: and the recouerers
    T’enioy the tother moyety, for their charge.

    ING. Thorowout _England_?

                        MER. Yes, which will arise                  50
    To eyghteene _millions_, seuen the first yeere:
    I haue computed all, and made my suruay
    Vnto an acre. I’ll beginne at the Pan,
    Not, at the skirts: as some ha’ done, and lost,
    All that they wrought, their timber-worke, their trench,        55
    Their bankes all borne away, or else fill’d vp
    By the next winter. Tut, they neuer went
    The way: I’ll haue it all.

       ING. A gallant tract
    Of land it is!

              MER. ’Twill yeeld a pound an acre.
    Wee must let cheape, euer, at first. But Sir,                   60
    This lookes too large for you, I see. Come hither,
    We’ll haue a lesse. Here’s a plain fellow, you see him,
    Has his black bag of papers, there, in Buckram,
    Wi’ not be sold for th’Earledome of _Pancridge_: Draw,
    Gi’ me out one, by chance. Proiect. 4. _Dog-skinnes?_           65
    Twelue thousand pound! the very worst, at first.          [113]

    FIT. Pray, you let’s see’t Sir.

                MER. ’Tis a toy, a trifle!

    FIT. Trifle! 12. thousand pound for dogs-skins?

                                MER. Yes,
    But, by my way of dressing, you must know, Sir,
    And med’cining the leather, to a height                         70
    Of improu’d ware, like your _Borachio_
    Of _Spaine_, Sir. I can fetch nine thousand for’t--

    ING. Of the Kings glouer?

              MER. Yes, how heard you that?

    ING. Sir, I doe know you can.

                        MER. Within this houre:
    And reserue halfe my secret. Pluck another;                     75
    See if thou hast a happier hand: I thought so.
                              _Hee pluckes out the 2. Bottle-ale._
    The very next worse to it! Bottle-ale.
    Yet, this is two and twenty thousand! Pr’y thee
    Pull out another, two or three.

                         FIT. Good, stay, friend,
    By bottle-ale, two and twenty thousand pound?                   80

    MER. Yes, Sir, it’s cast to penny-hal’penny-farthing,
    O’ the back-side, there you may see it, read,
    I will not bate a _Harrington_ o’ the summe.
    I’ll winne it i’ my water, and my malt,
    My furnaces, and hanging o’ my coppers,                         85
    The tonning, and the subtilty o’ my yest;
    And, then the earth of my bottles, which I dig,
    Turne vp, and steepe, and worke, and neale, my selfe,
    To a degree of _Porc’lane_. You will wonder,
    At my proportions, what I will put vp                           90
    In seuen yeeres! for so long time, I aske
    For my inuention. I will saue in cork,
    In my mere stop’ling, ’boue three thousand pound,
    Within that terme: by googing of ’hem out
    Iust to the size of my bottles, and not slicing,                95
    There’s infinite losse i’ that. What hast thou there?
    O’ making wine of raisins: this is in hand, now,
                            _Hee drawes out another_. Raisines.

    ING. Is not that strange, S^r, to make wine of raisins?

    MER. Yes, and as true a wine, as the wines of _France_,
    Or _Spaine_, or _Italy_, Looke of what grape                   100
    My raisin is, that wine I’ll render perfect,
    As of the _muscatell_ grape, I’ll render _muscatell_;
    Of the _Canary_, his; the _Claret_, his;
    So of all kinds: and bate you of the prices,
    Of wine, throughout the kingdome, halfe in halfe.              105

    ING. But, how, S^r, if you raise the other commodity, Raysins?

         MER. Why, then I’ll make it out of blackberries:
    And it shall doe the same. ’Tis but more art,
    And the charge lesse. Take out another.

                                 FIT. No, good Sir.
    Saue you the trouble, I’le not looke, nor heare                110
    Of any, but your first, there; the _Drown’d-land_:
    If’t will doe, as you say.

                              MER. Sir, there’s not place,
    To gi’ you demonstration of these things.                [114]
    They are a little to subtle. But, I could shew you
    Such a necessity in’t, as you must be                          115
    But what you please: against the receiu’d heresie,
    That _England_ beares no Dukes. Keepe you the land, S^r,
    The greatnesse of th’ estate shall throw’t vpon you.
    If you like better turning it to money,
    What may not you, S^r, purchase with that wealth?              120
    Say, you should part with two o’ your millions,
    To be the thing you would, who would not do’t?
    As I protest, I will, out of my diuident,
    Lay, for some pretty principality,
    In _Italy_, from the Church: Now, you perhaps,                 125
    Fancy the smoake of _England_, rather? But--
    Ha’ you no priuate roome, Sir, to draw to,
    T’enlarge our selues more vpon.

                    FIT. O yes, _Diuell_!

    MER. These, Sir, are bus’nesses, aske to be carryed
    With caution, and in cloud.

                                FIT. I apprehend,                  130
    They doe so, S^r. _Diuell_, which way is your Mistresse?

    PVG. Aboue, S^r. in her chamber.

            FIT. O that’s well.
    Then, this way, good, Sir.

                 MER. I shall follow you; _Traines_,
    Gi’ mee the bag, and goe you presently,
    Commend my seruice to my Lady _Tail-bush_.                     135
    Tell her I am come from Court this morning; say,
    I’haue got our bus’nesse mou’d, and well: Intreat her,
    That shee giue you the four-score Angels, and see ’hem
    Dispos’d of to my Councel, Sir _Poul Eytherside_.
    Sometime, to day, I’ll waite vpon her Ladiship,                140
    With the relation.

        ING. Sir, of what dispatch,
    He is! Do you marke?

                    MER. _Ingine_, when did you see
    My cousin _Euer-ill_? keepes he still your quarter?
    I’ the _Bermudas_?

        ING. Yes, Sir, he was writing
    This morning, very hard.

              MER. Be not you knowne to him,
    That I am come to Towne: I haue effected                       146
    A businesse for him, but I would haue it take him,
    Before he thinks for’t.

        ING. Is it past?

            MER. Not yet.
    ’Tis well o’ the way.

        ING. O Sir! your worship takes
    Infinit paines.

            MER. I loue Friends, to be actiue:                     150
    A sluggish nature puts off man, and kinde.

    ING. And such a blessing followes it.

                       MER. I thanke
    My fate. Pray you let’s be priuate, Sir?

            FIT. In, here.

    MER. Where none may interrupt vs.

                           FIT. You heare, _Diuel_,
    Lock the streete-doores fast, and let no one in                155
    (Except they be this Gentlemans followers)
    To trouble mee. Doe you marke? Yo’ haue heard and seene
    Something, to day; and, by it, you may gather
    Your Mistresse is a fruite, that’s worth the stealing
    And therefore worth the watching. Be you sure, now       [115]
    Yo’ haue all your eyes about you; and let in                   161
    No lace-woman; nor bawd, that brings French-masques,
    And cut-works. See you? Nor old croanes, with wafers,
    To conuey letters. Nor no youths, disguis’d
    Like country-wiues, with creame, and marrow-puddings.          165
    Much knauery may be vented in a pudding,
    Much bawdy intelligence: They’are shrewd ciphers.
    Nor turne the key to any neyghbours neede;
    Be’t but to kindle fire, or begg a little,
    Put it out, rather: all out, to an ashe,                       170
    That they may see no smoake. Or water, spill it:
    Knock o’ the empty tubs, that by the sound,
    They may be forbid entry. Say, wee are robb’d,
    If any come to borrow a spoone, or so.
    I wi’ not haue good fortune, or gods blessing                  175
    Let in, while I am busie.

                PVG. I’le take care, Sir:
    They sha’ not trouble you, if they would.

                FIT. Well, doe so.

    I haue no singular seruice of this, now?

    As to bring broad-clothes hither: or transport                   5
    Fresh oranges into _Spaine_. I finde it, now:
    My _Chiefe_ was i’ the right. Can any feind
    Boast of a better _Vice_, then heere by nature,
    And art, th’are owners of? Hell ne’r owne mee,
    But I am taken! the fine tract of it                            10
    Pulls mee along! To heare men such professors
    Growne in our subtlest _Sciences_! My first _Act_, now,
    Shall be, to make this Master of mine cuckold:
    The primitiue worke of darknesse, I will practise!
    I will deserue so well of my faire Mistresse,                   15
    By my discoueries, first; my counsells after;
    And keeping counsell, after that: as who,
    So euer, is one, I’le be another, sure,
    I’ll ha’ my share. Most delicate damn’d flesh!
    Shee will be! O! that I could stay time, now,         [116]     20
    Midnight will come too fast vpon mee, I feare,
    To cut my pleasure--

           M^rs. FI. Looke at the back-doore,
                                   _Shee sends_ Diuell _out_.
    One knocks, see who it is.

                PVG. Dainty _she-Diuell_!

    M^rs. FI. I cannot get this venter of the cloake,
    Out of my fancie; nor the Gentlemans way,                       25
    He tooke, which though ’twere strange, yet ’twas handsome,
    And had a grace withall, beyond the newnesse.
    Sure he will thinke mee that dull stupid creature,
    Hee said, and may conclude it; if I finde not
    Some thought to thanke th’ attemp. He did presume,              30
    By all the carriage of it, on my braine,
    For answer; and will sweare ’tis very barren,
    If it can yeeld him no returne. Who is it?

                                         Diuell _returnes_.

    PVG. Mistresse, it is, but first, let me assure
    The excellence, of Mistresses, I am,                            35
    Although my Masters man, my Misstresse slaue,
    The seruant of her secrets, and sweete turnes,
    And know, what fitly will conduce to either.

    M^rs. FI. What’s this? I pray you come to your selfe and thinke
    What your part is: to make an answer. Tell,                     40
    Who is it at the doore?

                          PVG. The Gentleman, M^rs,
    Who was at the cloake-charge to speake with you,
    This morning, who expects onely to take
    Some small command’ments from you, what you please,
    Worthy your forme, hee saies, and gentlest manners.             45

    M^rs. FI. O! you’ll anon proue his hyr’d man, I feare,
    What has he giu’n you, for this message? Sir,
    Bid him put off his hopes of straw, and leaue
    To spread his nets, in view, thus. Though they take
    Master _Fitz-dottrell_, I am no such foule,                     50
    Nor faire one, tell him, will be had with stalking.
    And wish him to for-beare his acting to mee,
    At the Gentlemans chamber-window in _Lincolnes-Inne_ there,
    That opens to my gallery: else, I sweare
    T’acquaint my husband with his folly, and leaue him             55
    To the iust rage of his offended iealousie.
    Or if your Masters sense be not so quicke
    To right mee, tell him, I shall finde a friend
    That will repaire mee. Say, I will be quiet.
    In mine owne house? Pray you, in those words giue it him.       60

    PVG. This is some foole turn’d!

                                          _He goes out._

                      M^rs. FI. If he be the Master,
    Now, of that state and wit, which I allow him;
    Sure, hee will vnderstand mee: I durst not
    Be more direct. For this officious fellow,
    My husbands new groome, is a spie vpon me,                      65
    I finde already. Yet, if he but tell him
    This in my words, hee cannot but conceiue               [117]
    Himselfe both apprehended, and requited.
    I would not haue him thinke hee met a _statue_:
    Or spoke to one, not there, though I were silent.               70
    How now? ha’ you told him?

           PVG. Yes.

                   M^rs. FI. And what saies he?

    PVG. Sayes he? That which my self would say to you, if I durst.
    That you are proude, sweet Mistresse? and with-all,
    A little ignorant, to entertaine
    The good that’s proffer’d; and (by your beauties leaue)         75
    Not all so wise, as some true politique wife
    Would be: who hauing match’d with such a _Nupson_
    (I speake it with my Masters peace) whose face
    Hath left t’accuse him, now, for’t doth confesse him,
    What you can make him; will yet (out of scruple,                80
    And a spic’d conscience) defraud the poore Gentleman,
    At least delay him in the thing he longs for,
    And makes it hs whole study, how to compasse,
    Onely a title. Could but he write _Cuckold_,
    He had his ends. For, looke you--

         M^rs. FI. This can be                                      85
    None but my husbands wit.

               PVG. My pretious M^rs.

    M. FI. It creaks his _Ingine_: The groome neuer durst
    Be, else, so saucy--

                     PVG. If it were not clearely,
    His worshipfull ambition; and the top of it;
    The very forked top too: why should hee                         90
    Keepe you, thus mur’d vp in a back-roome, Mistresse,
    Allow you ne’r a casement to the streete,
    Feare of engendering by the eyes, with gallants,
    Forbid you paper, pen and inke, like Rats-bane.
    Search your halfe pint of _muscatell_, lest a letter            95
    Be suncke i’ the pot: and hold your new-laid egge
    Against the fire, lest any charme be writ there?
    Will you make benefit of truth, deare Mistresse,
    If I doe tell it you: I do’t not often?
    I am set ouer you, imploy’d, indeed,                           100
    To watch your steps, your lookes, your very breathings,
    And to report them to him. Now, if you
    Will be a true, right, delicate sweete Mistresse,
    Why, wee will make a _Cokes_ of this _Wise Master_,
    We will, my Mistresse, an absolute fine _Cokes_,               105
    And mock, to ayre, all the deepe diligences
    Of such a solemne, and effectuall Asse,
    An Asse to so good purpose, as wee’ll vse him.
    I will contriue it so, that you shall goe
    To _Playes_, to _Masques_, to _Meetings_, and to _Feasts_.     110
    For, why is all this Rigging, and fine Tackle, Mistris,
    If you neat handsome vessells, of good sayle,
    Put not forth euer, and anon, with your nets
    Abroad into the world. It is your fishing.                [118]
    There, you shal choose your friends, your seruants, Lady,
    Your squires of honour; I’le conuey your letters,              116
    Fetch answers, doe you all the offices,
    That can belong to your bloud, and beauty. And,
    For the variety, at my times, although
    I am not in due _symmetrie_, the man                           120
    Of that proportion; or in rule
    Of _physicke_, of the iust complexion:
    Or of that truth of _Picardill_, in clothes,
    To boast a soueraignty o’re Ladies: yet
    I know, to do my turnes, sweet Mistresse. Come, kisse--

    M^rs. FI. How now!

                PVG. Deare delicate Mist. I am your slaue,         126
    Your little _worme_, that loues you: your fine _Monkey_;
    Your _Dogge_, your _Iacke_, your _Pug_, that longs to be
    Stil’d, o’ your pleasures.

                    M^rs. FIT. Heare you all this? Sir, Pray you,
    Come from your standing, doe, a little, spare                  130
                               _Shee thinkes her husband watches._
    Your selfe, Sir, from your watch, t’applaud your _Squire_,
    That so well followes your instructions!



ACT. II. SCENE. III.

FITZ-DOTTRELL.   Mistresse FITZ-DOTTREL.   PVG.

    How now, sweet heart? what’s the matter?

                                  M^rs. FI. Good!
    You are a stranger to the plot! you set not
    Your fancy _Diuell_, here, to tempt your wife,
    With all the insolent vnciuill language,
    Or action, he could vent?

                          FIT. Did you so, _Diuell_?                 5

    M^rs. FIT. Not you? you were not planted i’ your hole to heare him,
    Vpo’ the stayres? or here, behinde the hangings?
    I doe not know your qualities? he durst doe it,
    And you not giue directions?

                         FIT. You shall see, wife,
    Whether he durst, or no: and what it was,                       10
    I did direct.

             _Her husband goes out, and enters presently with a
                   cudgell vpon him._

          PVG. Sweet Mistresse, are you mad?

    FIT. You most mere Rogue! you open manifest Villaine!
    You Feind apparant you! you declar’d Hel-hound!

    PVG. Good S^r.

                 FIT. Good Knaue, good Rascal, and good Traitor.
    Now, I doe finde you parcel-_Diuell_, indeed.                   15
    Vpo’ the point of trust? I’ your first charge?
    The very day o’ your probation?
    To tempt your Mistresse? You doe see, good wedlocke,
    How I directed him.

                M^rs. FIT. Why, where S^r? were you?         [119]

    FIT. Nay, there is one blow more, for exercise:                 20
                            _After a pause. He strikes him againe_
    I told you, I should doe it.

               PVG. Would you had done, Sir.

    FIT. O wife, the rarest man! yet there’s another
    To put you in mind o’ the last, such a braue man, wife!
    Within, he has his proiects, and do’s vent ’hem,
                                                    _and againe._
    The gallantest! where you _tentiginous_? ha?                    25
    Would you be acting of the _Incubus_?
    Did her silks rustling moue you?

                PVG. Gentle Sir.

    FIT. Out of my sight. If thy name were not _Diuell_,
    Thou shouldst not stay a minute with me. In,
    Goe, yet stay: yet goe too. I am resolu’d.                      30
    What I will doe: and you shall know’t afore-hand.
    Soone as the Gentleman is gone, doe you heare?
    I’ll helpe your lisping. Wife, such a man, wife!
                                                Diuell _goes out_.
    He has such plots! He will make mee a _Duke_!
    No lesse, by heauen! six Mares, to your coach, wife!            35
    That’s your proportion! And your coach-man bald!
    Because he shall be bare, inough. Doe not you laugh,
    We are looking for a place, and all, i’ the map
    What to be of. Haue faith, be not an Infidell.
    You know, I am not easie to be gull’d.                          40
    I sweare, when I haue my _millions_, else. I’ll make
    Another _Dutchesse_: if you ha’ not faith.

    M^rs. FI. You’ll ha’ too much, I feare, in these false spirits.

    FIT. Spirits? O, no such thing! wife! wit, mere wit!
    This man defies the _Diuell_, and all his works!                45
    He dos’t by _Ingine_, and deuises, hee!
    He has his winged ploughes, that goe with sailes,
    Will plough you forty acres, at once! and mills.
    Will spout you water, ten miles off! All _Crowland_
    Is ours, wife; and the fens, from vs, in _Norfolke_,            50
    To the vtmost bound of _Lincoln-shire_! we haue view’d it,
    And measur’d it within all; by the scale!
    The richest tract of land, Loue, i’ the kingdome!
    There will be made seuenteene, or eighteene _millions_;
    Or more, as’t may be handled! wherefore, thinke,                55
    Sweet heart, if th’ hast a fancy to one place,
    More then another, to be _Dutchesse_ of;
    Now, name it: I will ha’t what ere it cost,
    (If’t will be had for money) either here,                       59
    Or’n _France_, or _Italy_.

                  M^rs. FI. You ha’ strange phantasies!




ACT. II. SCENE. IV.

 MERE-CRAFT.   FITZ-DOTTRELL.
          INGINE.

    Where are you, Sir?

                        FIT. I see thou hast no _talent_      [120]
    This way, wife. Vp to thy gallery; doe, _Chuck_,
    Leaue vs to talke of it, who vnderstand it.

    MER. I thinke we ha’ found a place to fit you, now, Sir.
    _Gloc’ster_.

           FIT. O, no, I’ll none!

                MER. Why, S^r?

                       FIT. Tis fatall.                              5

    MER. That you say right in. _Spenser_, I thinke, the younger,
    Had his last honour thence. But, he was but _Earle_.

    FIT. I know not that, Sir. But _Thomas_ of _Woodstocke_,
    I’m sure, was _Duke_, and he was made away,
    At _Calice_; as _Duke Humphrey_ was at _Bury_:                  10
    And _Richard_ the third, you know what end he came too.

    MER. By m’faith you are cunning i’ the _Chronicle_, Sir.

    FIT. No, I confesse I ha’t from the _Play-bookes_,
    And thinke they’are more _authentique_.

                     ING. That’s sure, Sir.

    MER. What say you (to this then)

                                 _He whispers him of a place._

                     FIT. No, a noble house.                        15
    Pretends to that. I will doe no man wrong.

    MER. Then take one proposition more, and heare it
    As past exception.

                  FIT. What’s that?

                                    MER. To be
    _Duke_ of those lands, you shall recouer; take
    Your title, thence, Sir, _Duke_ of the _Drown’d lands_,         20
    Or _Drown’d-land_.

             FIT. Ha? that last has a good sound!
    I like it well. The _Duke_ of _Drown’d-land_?

                                       ING. Yes;
    It goes like _Groen-land_, Sir, if you marke it.

                                MER. I,
    And drawing thus your honour from the worke,
    You make the reputation of that, greater;                       25
    And stay’t the longer i’ your name.

                                 FIT. ’Tis true.
    _Drown’d-lands_ will liue in _Drown’d-land_!

                                MER. Yes, when you
    Ha’ no foote left; as that must be, Sir, one day.
    And, though it tarry in your heyres, some _forty_,
    _Fifty_ descents, the longer liuer, at last, yet,               30
    Must thrust ’hem out on’t: if no quirk in law,
    Or odde _Vice_ o’ their owne not do’it first.
    Wee see those changes, daily: the faire lands,
    That were the _Clyents_, are the _Lawyers_, now:
    And those rich Mannors, there, of good man _Taylors_,           35
    Had once more wood vpon ’hem, then the yard,
    By which th’ were measur’d out for the last purchase.    [121]
    Nature hath these vicissitudes. Shee makes
    No man a state of perpetuety, Sir.

    FIT. Yo’ are i’ the right. Let’s in then, and conclude.         40
                                             _Hee spies_ Diuell.
    I my sight, againe? I’ll talke with you, anon.




ACT. II. SCENE. V.

PVG.

    Svre hee will geld mee, if I stay: or worse,
    Pluck out my tongue, one o’ the two. This Foole,
    There is no trusting of him: and to quit him,
    Were a contempt against my _Chiefe_, past pardon.
    It was a shrewd disheartning this, at first!                     5
    Who would ha’ thought a woman so well harness’d,
    Or rather well-caparison’d, indeed,
    That weares such petticoates, and lace to her smocks,
    Broad seaming laces (as I see ’hem hang there)
    And garters which are lost, if shee can shew ’hem,              10
    Could ha’ done this? _Hell!_ why is shee so braue?
    It cannot be to please _Duke Dottrel_, sure,
    Nor the dull pictures, in her gallery,
    Nor her owne deare reflection, in her glasse;
    Yet that may be: I haue knowne many of ’hem,                    15
    Beginne their pleasure, but none end it, there:
    (That I consider, as I goe a long with it)
    They may, for want of better company,
    Or that they thinke the better, spend an houre;
    Two, three, or foure, discoursing with their shaddow:           20
    But sure they haue a farther speculation.
    No woman drest with so much care, and study,
    Doth dresse her selfe in vaine. I’ll vexe this _probleme_,
    A little more, before I leaue it, sure.


ACT. IJ. SCENE. VI.

WITTIPOL.   MANLY.   Mistresse FITZ-DOTTREL.
                 PVG.

    This was a fortune, happy aboue thought,             [122]
    That this should proue thy chamber: which I fear’d
    Would be my greatest trouble! this must be
    The very window, and that the roome.

                            MAN. It is.
    I now remember, I haue often seene there                         5
    A woman, but I neuer mark’d her much.

    WIT. Where was your soule, friend?

         MAN. Faith, but now, and then,
    Awake vnto those obiects.

                        WIT. You pretend so.
    Let mee not liue, if I am not in loue
    More with her wit, for this direction, now,                     10
    Then with her forme, though I ha’ prais’d that prettily,
    Since I saw her, and you, to day. Read those.
          _Hee giues him a paper, wherein is the copy of a Song._
    They’ll goe vnto the ayre you loue so well.
    Try ’hem vnto the note, may be the musique
    Will call her sooner; light, shee’s here. Sing quickly.         15

    M^rs. FIT. Either he vnderstood him not: or else,
    The fellow was not faithfull in deliuery,
    Of what I bad. And, I am iustly pay’d,
    That might haue made my profit of his seruice,
    But, by mis-taking, haue drawne on his enuy,                    20
    And done the worse defeate vpon my selfe.
                        Manly _sings_, Pug _enters perceiues it_.
    How! Musique? then he may be there: and is sure.

    PVG. O! Is it so? Is there the enter-view?
    Haue I drawne to you, at last, my cunning _Lady_?
    The _Diuell_ is an _Asse_! fool’d off! and beaten!              25
    Nay, made an instrument! and could not sent it!
    Well, since yo’ haue showne the malice of a woman,
    No lesse then her true wit, and learning, Mistresse,
    I’ll try, if little _Pug_ haue the malignity
    To recompence it, and so saue his danger.                       30
    ’Tis not the paine, but the discredite of it,
    The _Diuell_ should not keepe a body intire.

    WIT. Away, fall backe, she comes.

                    MAN. I’ll leaue you, Sir,
    The Master of my chamber. I haue businesse.

    WIT. M^rs!

            M^rs. FI. You make me paint, S^r.

             WIT. The’are faire colours,                            35
    _Lady_, and naturall! I did receiue
    Some commands from you, lately, gentle _Lady_,          [123]
       _This Scene is acted at two windo’s as out of_
              _two contiguous buildings._
    But so perplex’d, and wrap’d in the deliuery,
    As I may feare t’haue mis-interpreted:
    But must make suit still, to be neere your grace.               40

    M^rs. FI. Who is there with you, S^r?

                               WIT. None, but my selfe.
    It falls out. _Lady_, to be a deare friends lodging.
    Wherein there’s some conspiracy of fortune
    With your poore seruants bles affections.

    M^rs. FI. Who was it sung?

         WIT. He, _Lady_, but hee’s gone,                           45
    Vpon my entreaty of him, seeing you
    Approach the window. Neither need you doubt him,
    If he were here. He is too much a gentleman.

    M^rs. FI. Sir, if you iudge me by this simple action,
    And by the outward habite, and complexion                       50
    Of easinesse, it hath, to your designe;
    You may with Iustice, say, I am a woman:
    And a strange woman. But when you shall please,
    To bring but that concurrence of my fortune,
    To memory, which to day your selfe did vrge:                    55
    It may beget some fauour like excuse,
    Though none like reason.

    WIT. No, my tune-full Mistresse?
    Then, surely, _Loue_ hath none: nor _Beauty_ any;
    Nor _Nature_ violenced, in both these:
    With all whose gentle tongues you speake, at once.              60
    I thought I had inough remou’d, already,
    That scruple from your brest, and left yo’ all reason;
    When, through my mornings perspectiue I shewd you
    A man so aboue excuse, as he is the cause,
    Why any thing is to be done vpon him:                           65
    And nothing call’d an iniury, mis-plac’d.
    I’rather, now had hope, to shew you how _Loue_
    By his accesses, growes more naturall:
    And, what was done, this morning, with such force
    Was but deuis’d to serue the present, then.                     70
    That since _Loue_ hath the honour to approach
                  _He grows more familiar in his Court-ship._
    These sister-swelling brests; and touch this soft,
    And rosie hand; hee hath the skill to draw
    Their _Nectar_ forth, with kissing; and could make
    More wanton salts, from this braue promontory,                  75
    Downe to this valley, then the nimble _Roe_;
                  _playes with her paps, kisseth her hands, &c._
    Could play the hopping _Sparrow_, ’bout these nets;
    And sporting _Squirell_ in these crisped groues;
    Bury himselfe in euery _Silke-wormes_ kell,
    Is here vnrauell’d; runne into the snare,                       80
    Which euery hayre is, cast into a curle,
    To catch a _Cupid_ flying: Bath himselfe
    In milke, and roses, here, and dry him, there;
    Warme his cold hands, to play with this smooth, round,   [124]
    And well torn’d chin, as with the _Billyard_ ball;              85
    Rowle on these lips, the banks of loue, and there
    At once both plant, and gather kisses. _Lady_,
    Shall I, with what I haue made to day here, call
    All sense to wonder, and all faith to signe
    The mysteries reuealed in your forme?                           90
    And will _Loue_ pardon mee the blasphemy
    I vtter’d, when I said, a glasse could speake
    This beauty, or that fooles had power to iudge it?

    _Doe but looke, on her eyes! They doe light--
      All that_ Loue’s _world comprizeth!                           95
    Doe but looke on her hayre! it is bright,
      As_ Loue’s _starre, when it riseth!
    Doe but marke, her fore-head’s smoother,
      Then words that sooth her!
    And from her arched browes, such a grace                       100
      Sheds it selfe through the face;
    As alone, there triumphs to the life,
      All the gaine, all the good, of the elements strife!_

    _Haue you seene but a bright Lilly grow,
      Before rude hands haue touch’d it?                           105
    Haue you mark’d but the fall of the Snow,
      Before the soyle hath smuch’d it?
    Haue you felt the wooll o’ the Beuer?
      Or Swans downe, euer?
    Or, haue smelt o’ the bud o’ the Bryer?                        110
      Or the Nard i’ the fire?
    Or, haue tasted the bag o’ the Bee?
      O, so white! O, so soft! O, so sweet is shee!_




ACT. II. SCENE. VII.

FITZ-DOTTRELL.   WITTIPOL.   PVG.

                 _Her husband appeares at her back._
    Is shee so, Sir? and, I will keepe her so.
    If I know how, or can: that wit of man
    Will doe’t, I’ll goe no farther. At this windo’
    She shall no more be _buz’d_ at. Take your leaue on’t.
    If you be sweet meates, wedlock, or sweet flesh,                 5
    All’s one: I doe not loue this _hum_ about you.
    A flye-blowne wife is not so proper, In:                  [125]
    For you, S^r, looke to heare from mee.

                          _Hee speakes out of his wiues window._

                 WIT. So, I doe, Sir.

    FIT. No, but in other termes. There’s no man offers
    This to my wife, but paies for’t.

                 WIT. That haue I, Sir.

    FIT. Nay, then, I tell you, you are.

                 WIT. What am I, Sir?                               11

    FIT. Why, that I’ll thinke on, when I ha’ cut your throat.

    WIT. Goe, you are an _Asse_.

                 FIT. I am resolu’d on’t, Sir.

    WIT. I thinke you are.

                 FIT. To call you to a reckoning.

    WIT. Away, you brokers blocke, you property.                    15

    FIT. S’light, if you strike me, I’ll strike your Mistresse.

                                               _Hee strikes his wife._

    WIT. O! I could shoote mine eyes at him, for that, now;
    Or leaue my teeth in’him, were they cuckolds bane,
    Inough to kill him. What prodigious,
    Blinde, and most wicked change of fortune’s this?               20
    I ha’ no ayre of patience: an my vaines
    Swell, and my sinewes start at iniquity of it.
    I shall breake, breake.

                                   _The_ Diuell _speakes below_.

                   PVG. This for the malice of it,
    And my reuenge may passe! But, now, my conscience
    Tells mee, I haue profited the cause of Hell                    25
    But little, in the breaking-off their loues.
    Which, if some other act of mine repaire not,
    I shall heare ill of in my accompt.

               Fitz-dottrel _enters with his wife as come downe_.

                                FIT. O, Bird!
    Could you do this? ’gainst me? and at this time, now?
    When I was so imploy’d, wholly for you,                         30
    Drown’d i’ my care (more, then the land, I sweare,
    I’haue hope to win) to make you peere-lesse? studying,
    For footemen for you, fine pac’d huishers, pages,
    To serue you o’ the knee; with what Knights wife,
    To beare your traine, and sit with your foure women             35
    In councell, and receiue intelligences,
    From forraigne parts, to dresse you at all pieces!
    Y’haue (a’most) turn’d my good affection, to you;
    Sowr’d my sweet thoughts; all my pure purposes:
    I could now finde (i’ my very heart) to make                    40
    Another, _Lady Dutchesse_; and depose you.
    Well, goe your waies in. _Diuell_, you haue redeem’d all.
    I doe forgiue you. And I’ll doe you good.




ACT. II. SCENE. VIIJ.

MERE-CRAFT.   FITZ-DOTTREL.   INGINE.
                TRAINES.

    Why ha you these excursions? where ha’ you beene, Sir?    [126]

    FIT. Where I ha’ beene vex’d a little, with a toy!

    MER. O Sir! no toyes must trouble your graue head,
    Now it is growing to be great. You must
    Be aboue all those things.

              FIT. Nay, nay, so I will.                              5

    MER. Now you are to’ard the Lord, you must put off
    The man, Sir.

              ING. He saies true.

                  MER. You must do nothing
    As you ha’ done it heretofore; not know,
    Or salute any man.

            ING. That was your bed-fellow,
    The other moneth.

               MER. The other moneth? the weeke.                    10
    Thou dost not know the priueledges, _Ingine_,
    Follow that Title; nor how swift: To day,
    When he has put on his Lords face once, then--

    FIT. Sir, for these things I shall doe well enough,
    There is no feare of me. But then, my wife is                   15
    Such an vntoward thing! shee’ll neuer learne
    How to comport with it. I am out of all
    Conceipt, on her behalfe.

              MER. Best haue her taught, Sir.

    FIT. Where? Are there any Schooles for _Ladies_? Is there
    An _Academy_ for women? I doe know,                             20
    For men, there was: I learn’d in it, my selfe,
    To make my legges, and doe my postures.

                          ING. Sir.
    Doe you remember the conceipt you had--
    O’ the Spanish gowne, at home?

       Ingine _whispers_ Merecraft, Merecraft _turnes to_ Fitz-dottrel.

                         MER. Ha! I doe thanke thee,
    With all my heart, deare _Ingine_. Sir, there is                25
    A certaine _Lady_, here about the Towne,
    An _English_ widdow, who hath lately trauell’d,
    But shee’s call’d the _Spaniard_; cause she came
    Latest from thence: and keepes the _Spanish_ habit.
    Such a rare woman! all our women heere,                         30
    That are of spirit, and fashion flocke, vnto her,
    As to their President; their _Law_; their _Canon_;
    More then they euer did, to _Oracle-Foreman_.
    Such rare receipts shee has, Sir, for the face;
    Such _oyles_; such _tinctures_; such _pomatumn’s_;              35
    Such _perfumes_; _med’cines_; _quintessences_, _&c._
    And such a Mistresse of behauiour;                        [127]
    She knowes, from the _Dukes_ daughter, to the Doxey,
    What is their due iust: and no more!

                                   FIT. O Sir!
    You please me i’ this, more then mine owne greatnesse,          40
    Where is shee? Let vs haue her.

                            MER. By your patience,
    We must vse meanes; cast how to be acquainted--

    FIT. Good, S^r, about it.

                MER. We must think how, first.

                             FIT. O!
    I doe not loue to tarry for a thing,
    When I haue a mind to’t. You doe not know me.                   45
    If you doe offer it.

                       MER. Your wife must send
    Some pretty token to her, with a complement,
    And pray to be receiu’d in her good graces,
    All the great _Ladies_ do’t.

        FIT. She shall, she shall,
    What were it best to be?

                        MER. Some little toy,                       50
    I would not haue it any great matter, Sir:
    A _Diamant_ ring, of _forty_ or _fifty_ pound,
    Would doe it handsomely: and be a gift
    Fit for your wife to send, and her to take.

    FIT. I’ll goe, and tell my wife on’t, streight.                 55

                                 Fitz-dottrel _goes out_.

                                             MER. Why this
    Is well! The clothes we’haue now: But, where’s this _Lady_?
    If we could get a witty boy, now, _Ingine_;
    That were an excellent cracke: I could instruct him,
    To the true height. For any thing takes this _dottrel_.

    ING. Why, Sir your best will be one o’ the players!             60

    MER. No, there’s no trusting them. They’ll talke on’t,
    And tell their _Poets_.

                      ING. What if they doe? The iest
    will brooke the Stage. But, there be some of ’hem
    Are very honest Lads. There’s _Dicke Robinson_
    A very pretty fellow, and comes often                           65
    To a Gentlemans chamber, a friends of mine. We had
    The merriest supper of it there, one night,
    The Gentlemans Land-lady invited him
    To’a Gossips feast. Now, he Sir brought _Dick Robinson_,
    Drest like a Lawyers wife, amongst ’hem all;                    70
    (I lent him cloathes) but, to see him behaue it;
    And lay the law; and carue; and drinke vnto ’hem;
    And then talke baudy: and send frolicks! o!
    It would haue burst your buttons, or not left you
    A seame.

                MER. They say hee’s an ingenious youth!             75

    ING. O Sir! and dresses himselfe, the best! beyond
    Forty o’ your very _Ladies_! did you ne’r see him?

    MER. No, I do seldome see those toyes. But thinke you,
    That we may haue him?

                        ING. Sir, the young Gentleman
    I tell you of, can command him. Shall I attempt it?             80

    MER. Yes, doe it.

                                       _Enters againe._

             FIT. S’light, I cannot get my wife
    To part with a ring, on any termes: and yet,
    The sollen _Monkey_ has two.

                            MER. It were ’gainst reason
    That you should vrge it; Sir, send to a Gold-smith,       [128]
    Let not her lose by’t.

        FIT. How do’s she lose by’t?                                85
    Is’t not for her?

                       MER. Make it your owne bounty,
    It will ha’ the better successe; what is a matter
    Of _fifty_ pound to you, S^r.

                           FIT. I’haue but a hundred
    _Pieces_, to shew here; that I would not breake--

    MER. You shall ha’ credit, Sir. I’ll send a ticket              90
    Vnto my Gold-smith. Heer, my man comes too,
    To carry it fitly. How now, _Traines_? What birds?

                                              Traines _enters_.

    TRA. Your Cousin _Euer-ill_ met me, and has beat mee,
    Because I would not tell him where you were:
    I thinke he has dogd me to the house too.

                                        FIT. Well--                 95
    You shall goe out at the back-doore, then, _Traines_.
    You must get _Guilt-head_ hither, by some meanes:

    TRA. ’Tis impossible!

                          FIT. Tell him, we haue _venison_,
    I’ll g’ him a piece, and send his wife a _Phesant_.

    TRA. A Forrest moues not, till that _forty_ pound,             100
    Yo’ had of him, last, be pai’d. He keepes more stirre,
    For that same petty summe, then for your bond
    Of _sixe_; and _Statute_ of _eight_ hundred!

                                      FIT. Tell him
    Wee’ll hedge in that. Cry vp _Fitz-dottrell_ to him,
    Double his price: Make him a man of mettall.                   105

    TRA. That will not need, his bond is current inough.





ACT. III. SCENE. I.                                    [129]


GVILT-HEAD.   PLVTARCHVS.

    All this is to make you a Gentleman:
    I’ll haue you learne, Sonne. Wherefore haue I plac’d you
    With S^r. _Poul Either-side_, but to haue so much Law
    To keepe your owne? Besides, he is a _Iustice_,
    Here i’ the Towne; and dwelling, Sonne, with him,                5
    You shal learne that in a yeere, shall be worth twenty
    Of hauing stay’d you at _Oxford_, or at _Cambridge_,
    Or sending you to the _Innes_ of _Court_, or _France_.
    I am call’d for now in haste, by Master _Meere-craft_
    To trust Master _Fitz-dottrel_, a good man:                     10
    I’haue inquir’d him, eighteene hundred a yeere,
    (His name is currant) for a diamant ring
    Of forty, shall not be worth thirty (thats gain’d)
    And this is to make you a Gentleman!

    PLV. O, but good father, you trust too much!

                                  GVI. Boy, boy,                    15
    We liue, by finding fooles out, to be trusted.
    Our shop-bookes are our pastures, our corn-grounds,
    We lay ’hem op’n for them to come into:
    And when wee haue ’hem there, wee driue ’hem vp
    In t’one of our two Pounds, the _Compters_, streight,           20
    And this is to make you a Gentleman!
    Wee Citizens neuer trust, but wee doe coozen:
    For, if our debtors pay, wee coozen them;
    And if they doe not, then we coozen our selues.
    But that’s a hazard euery one must runne,                       25
    That hopes to make his Sonne a Gentleman!

    PLV. I doe not wish to be one, truely, Father.
    In a descent, or two, wee come to be
    Iust ’itheir state, fit to be coozend, like ’hem.
    And I had rather ha’ tarryed i’ your trade: 30
    For, since the _Gentry_ scorne the Citty so much,         [130]
    Me thinkes we should in time, holding together,
    And matching in our owne tribes, as they say,
    Haue got an _Act_ of _Common Councell_, for it,
    That we might coozen them out of _rerum natura_.                35

    GVI. I, if we had an _Act_ first to forbid
    The marrying of our wealthy heyres vnto ’hem:
    And daughters, with such lauish portions.
    That confounds all.

             PLV. And makes a _Mungril_ breed, Father.
    And when they haue your money, then they laugh at you:          40
    Or kick you downe the stayres. I cannot abide ’hem.
    I would faine haue ’hem coozen’d, but not trusted.

    O, is he come! I knew he would not faile me.
    Welcome, good _Guilt-head_, I must ha’ you doe
    A noble Gentleman, a courtesie, here:
    In a mere toy (some pretty Ring, or Iewell)
    Of fifty, or threescore pound (Make it a hundred,                5
    And hedge in the last forty, that I owe you,
    And your owne price for the Ring) He’s a good man, S^r,
    And you may hap’ see him a great one! Hee,
    Is likely to bestow hundreds, and thousands,
    Wi’ you; if you can humour him. A great prince                  10
    He will be shortly. What doe you say?

                               GVI. In truth, Sir
    I cannot. ’T has beene a long vacation with vs?

    FIT. Of what, I pray thee? of wit? or honesty?
    Those are your Citizens long vacations.

    PLV. Good Father do not trust ’hem.

                   MER. Nay, _Thom. Guilt-head_.                    15
    Hee will not buy a courtesie and begge it:
    Hee’ll rather pay, then pray. If you doe for him,
    You must doe cheerefully. His credit, Sir,
    Is not yet prostitute! Who’s this? thy sonne?
    A pretty youth, what’s his name?

                  PLV. _Plutarchus_, Sir,                           20

    MER. _Plutarchus!_ How came that about?

                              GVI. That yeere S^r,
    That I begot him, I bought _Plutarch’s_ liues,
    And fell s’ in loue with the booke, as I call’d my sonne
    By’his name; In hope he should be like him:
    And write the liues of our great men!

              MER. I’ the City?                         [131]       25
    And you do breed him, there?

        GVI. His minde, Sir, lies
    Much to that way.

           MER. Why, then, he is i’ the right way.

    GVI. But, now, I had rather get him a good wife,
    And plant him i’ the countrey; there to vse
    The blessing I shall leaue him:

                               MER. Out vpon’t!                     30
    And lose the laudable meanes, thou hast at home, heere,
    T’aduance, and make him a young _Alderman_?
    Buy him a Captaines place, for shame; and let him
    Into the world, early, and with his plume,
    And Scarfes, march through _Cheapside_, or along _Cornehill_,
    And by the vertue’of those, draw downe a wife                   36
    There from a windo’, worth ten thousand pound!
    Get him the posture booke, and’s leaden men,
    To set vpon a table, ’gainst his Mistresse
    Chance to come by, that hee may draw her in,                    40
    And shew her _Finsbury_ battells.

                               GVI. I haue plac’d him
    With Iustice _Eytherside_, to get so much law--

    MER. As thou hast conscience. Come, come, thou dost wrong
    Pretty _Plutarchus_, who had not his name,
    For nothing: but was borne to traine the youth                  45
    Of _London_, in the military truth--
    That way his _Genius_ lies. My Cousin _Euerill_!

    O, are you heere, Sir? ’pray you let vs whisper.

    PLV. Father, deare Father, trust him if you loue mee.

    GVI. Why, I doe meane it, boy; but, what I doe,
    Must not come easily from mee: Wee must deale
    With _Courtiers_, boy, as _Courtiers_ deale with vs.             5
    If I haue a _Businesse_ there, with any of them,
    Why, I must wait, I’am sure on’t, Son: and though
    My _Lord_ dispatch me, yet his worshipfull man--
    Will keepe me for his sport, a moneth, or two,
    To shew mee with my fellow Cittizens.                           10
    I must make his traine long, and full, one quarter;
    And helpe the spectacle of his greatnesse. There,
    Nothing is done at once, but iniuries, boy:
    And they come head-long! an their good turnes moue not,    [124]
    Or very slowly.

             PLV. Yet sweet father, trust him.                      15

    GVI. VVell, I will thinke.

                     EV. Come, you must do’t, Sir.
    I am vndone else, and your _Lady Tayle-bush_
    Has sent for mee to dinner, and my cloaths
    Are all at pawne. I had sent out this morning,
    Before I heard you were come to towne, some twenty              20
    Of my epistles, and no one returne--

                         Mere-craft _tells him of his faults_.

    MER. VVhy, I ha’ told you o’ this. This comes of wearing
    Scarlet, gold lace, and cut-works! your fine gartring!
    VVith your blowne roses, Cousin! and your eating
    _Phesant_, and _Godwit_, here in _London_! haunting             25
    The _Globes_, and _Mermaides_! wedging in with _Lords_,
    Still at the table! and affecting lechery,
    In veluet! where could you ha’ contented your selfe
    With cheese, salt-butter, and a pickled hering,
    I’ the Low-countries; there worne cloth, and fustian!           30
    Beene satisfied with a leape o’ your Host’s daughter,
    In garrison, a wench of a stoter! or,
    Your _Sutlers_ wife, i’ the leaguer, of two blanks!
    You neuer, then, had runne vpon this flat,
    To write your letters missiue, and send out                     35
    Your priuy seales, that thus haue frighted off
    All your acquaintance; that they shun you at distance,
    VVorse, then you do the Bailies!

                          EV. Pox vpon you.
    I come not to you for counsell, I lacke money.

                                               _Hee repines._

    MER. You doe not thinke, what you owe me already?

                                       EV. I?                       40
    They owe you, that meane to pay you. I’ll besworne,
    I neuer meant it. Come, you will proiect,
    I shall vndoe your practice, for this moneth else:
    You know mee.
                               _and threatens him._

          MER. I, yo’ are a right sweet nature!

    EV. Well, that’s all one!

          MER. You’ll leaue this Empire, one day?                   45
    You will not euer haue this tribute payd,
    Your scepter o’ the sword?

         EV. Tye vp your wit,
    Doe, and prouoke me not--

             MER. Will you, Sir, helpe,
    To what I shall prouoke another for you?

    EV. I cannot tell; try me: I thinke I am not                    50
    So vtterly, of an ore vn-to-be-melted,
    But I can doe my selfe good, on occasions.

                                             _They ioyne._

    MER. Strike in then, for your part. M^r. _Fitz-dottrel_
    If I transgresse in point of manners, afford mee
    Your best construction; I must beg my freedome                  55
    From your affayres, this day.

                FIT. How, S^r.

                             MER. It is
    In succour of this Gentlemans occasions,
    My kins-man--
                                  Mere-craft _pretends_ businesse.

                 FIT. You’ll not do me that affront, S^r.

    MER. I am sory you should so interpret it,
    But, Sir, it stands vpon his being inuested                     60
    In a new _office_, hee has stood for, long:             [133]

                   Mere-craft _describes the_ office _of_ Dependancy.

    _Master_ of the _Dependances_! A place
    Of my proiection too, Sir, and hath met
    Much opposition; but the State, now, see’s
    That great necessity of it, as after all                        65
    Their writing, and their speaking, against _Duells_,
    They haue erected it. His booke is drawne--
    For, since, there will be differences, daily,
    ’Twixt Gentlemen; and that the roaring manner
    Is growne offensiue; that those few, we call                    70
    The ciuill men o’ the sword, abhorre the vapours;
    They shall refer now, hither, for their _processe_;
    And such as tresspase ’gainst the rule of _Court_,
    Are to be fin’d--

             FIT. In troth, a pretty place!

    MER. A kinde of arbitrary _Court_ ’twill be, Sir.               75

    FIT. I shall haue matter for it, I beleeue,
    Ere it be long: I had a distast.

                              MER. But now, Sir,
    My learned councell, they must haue a feeling,
    They’ll part, Sir, with no bookes, without the hand-gout
    Be oyld, and I must furnish. If’t be money,                     80
    To me streight. I am Mine, _Mint_ and _Exchequer_.
    To supply all. What is’t? a hundred pound?

    EVE. No, th’ _Harpey_, now, stands on a hundred pieces.

    MER. Why, he must haue ’hem, if he will. To morrow, Sir,
    Will equally serue your occasion’s,----                         85
    And therefore, let me obtaine, that you will yeeld
    To timing a poore Gentlemans distresses,
    In termes of hazard.--

             FIT. By no meanes!

                    MER. I must
    Get him this money, and will.--

                        FIT. Sir, I protest,
    I’d rather stand engag’d for it my selfe:                       90
    Then you should leaue mee.

               MER. O good S^r. do you thinke
    So coursely of our manners, that we would,
    For any need of ours, be prest to take it:
    Though you be pleas’d to offer it.

       FIT. Why, by heauen,
    I meane it!

                 MER. I can neuer beleeue lesse.                    95
    But wee, Sir, must preserue our dignity,
    As you doe publish yours. By your faire leaue, Sir.

                                     _Hee offers to be gone._

    FIT. As I am a Gentleman, if you doe offer
    To leaue mee now, or if you doe refuse mee,                     99
    I will not thinke you loue mee.

                      MER. Sir, I honour you.
    And with iust reason, for these noble notes,
    Of the nobility, you pretend too! But, Sir--
    I would know, why? a motiue (he a stranger)
    You should doe this?

                    (EVE. You’ll mar all with your finenesse)

    FIT. Why, that’s all one, if ’twere, Sir, but my fancy.        105
    But I haue a _Businesse_, that perhaps I’d haue
    Brought to his _office_.

                    MER. O, Sir! I haue done, then;
    If hee can be made profitable, to you.                 [134]

    FIT. Yes, and it shall be one of my ambitions
    To haue it the first _Businesse_? May I not?                   110

    EVE. So you doe meane to make’t, a perfect _Businesse_.

    FIT. Nay, I’ll doe that, assure you: shew me once.

    MER. S^r, it concernes, the first be a perfect _Businesse_,
    For his owne honour!

      EVE. I, and th’ reputation
    Too, of my place.

                   FIT. Why, why doe I take this course, else?     115
    I am not altogether, an _Asse_, good Gentlemen,
    Wherefore should I consult you? doe you thinke?
    To make a song on’t? How’s your manner? tell vs.

    MER. Doe, satisfie him: giue him the whole course.

    EVE. First, by request, or otherwise, you offer                120
    Your _Businesse_ to the _Court_: wherein you craue:
    The iudgement of the _Master_ and the _Assistants_.

    FIT. Well, that’s done, now, what doe you vpon it?

    EVE. We streight S^r, haue recourse to the spring-head;
    Visit the ground; and, so disclose the nature:                 125
    If it will carry, or no. If wee doe finde,
    By our proportions it is like to proue
    A sullen, and blacke _Bus’nesse_ That it be
    Incorrigible; and out of, treaty; then.
    We file it, a _Dependance_!

                                FIT. So ’tis fil’d.                130
    What followes? I doe loue the order of these things.

    EVE. We then aduise the party, if he be
    A man of meanes, and hauings, that forth-with,
    He settle his estate: if not, at least
    That he pretend it. For, by that, the world                    135
    Takes notice, that it now is a _Dependance_.
    And this we call, Sir, _Publication_.

    FIT. Very sufficient! After _Publication_, now?

    EVE. Then we grant out our _Processe_, which is diuers;
    Eyther by _Chartell_, Sir, or _ore-tenus_,                     140
    Wherein the Challenger, and Challengee
    Or (with your _Spaniard_) your _Prouocador_,
    And _Prouocado_, haue their seuerall courses--

    FIT. I haue enough on’t! for an hundred pieces?
    Yes, for two hundred, vnder-write me, doe.                     145
    Your man will take my bond?

                          MER. That he will, sure.
    But, these same Citizens, they are such sharks!
    There’s an old debt of forty, I ga’ my word
    For one is runne away, to the _Bermudas_,
    And he will hooke in that, or he wi’ not doe.                   150

                      _He whispers_ Fitz-dottrell _aside_.

    FIT. Why, let him. That and the ring, and a hundred pieces,
    Will all but make two hundred?

                      MER. No, no more, Sir.
    What ready _Arithmetique_ you haue? doe you heare?
                                         _And then_ Guilt-head.
    A pretty mornings worke for you, this? Do it,
    You shall ha’ twenty pound on’t.

                          GVI. Twenty pieces?            [135]     155

    (PLV. Good Father, do’t)

                         MER. You will hooke still? well,
    Shew vs your ring. You could not ha’ done this, now
    With gentlenesse, at first, wee might ha’ thank’d you?
    But groane, and ha’ your courtesies come from you
    Like a hard stoole, and stinke? A man may draw                 160
    Your teeth out easier, then your money? Come,
    Were little _Guilt-head_ heere, no better a nature,
    I should ne’r loue him, that could pull his lips off, now!
                             _He pulls_ Plutarchus _by the lips_.
    Was not thy mother a Gentlewoman?

                      PLV. Yes, Sir.

    MER. And went to the Court at _Christmas_,
                       and S^t. _Georges-tide_?                    165
    And lent the Lords-men, chaines?

                       PLV. Of gold, and pearle, S^r.

    MER. I knew, thou must take, after some body!
    Thou could’st not be else. This was no shop-looke!
    I’ll ha’ thee Captaine _Guilt-head_, and march vp,
    And take in _Pimlico_, and kill the bush,                      170
    At euery tauerne! Thou shalt haue a wife,
    If smocks will mount, boy. How now? you ha’ there now
    Some _Bristo-stone_, or _Cornish_ counterfeit
    You’ld put vpon vs.
                              _He turns to old_ Guilt-head.

             GVI. No, Sir I assure you:
    Looke on his luster! hee will speake himselfe!                 175
    I’le gi’ you leaue to put him i’ the Mill,
    H’is no great, large stone, but a true _Paragon_,
    H’has all his corners, view him well.

                  MER. H’is yellow.

    GVI. Vpo’ my faith, S^r, o’ the right black-water,
    And very deepe! H’is set without a foyle, too.                 180
    Here’s one o’ the yellow-water, I’ll sell cheape.

    MER. And what do you valew this, at? thirty pound?

    GVI. No, Sir, he cost me forty, ere he was set.

    MER. Turnings, you meane? I know your _Equinocks_:
    You’are growne the better Fathers of ’hem o’ late.             185
    Well, where’t must goe, ’twill be iudg’d, and, therefore,
    Looke you’t be right. You shall haue fifty pound for’t.
                                         _Now to_ Fitz-dottrel.
    Not a deneer more! And, because you would
    Haue things dispatch’d, Sir, I’ll goe presently,
    Inquire out this _Lady_. If you thinke good, Sir.              190
    Hauing an hundred pieces ready, you may
    Part with those, now, to serue my kinsmans turnes,
    That he may wait vpon you, anon, the freer;
    And take ’hem when you ha’ seal’d, a game, of _Guilt-head_.

    FIT. I care not if I do!

      MER. And dispatch all,                                       195
    Together.

              FIT. There, th’are iust: a hundred pieces!
    I’ ha’ told ’hem ouer, twice a day, these two moneths.

              _Hee turnes ’hem out together.
                    And_ Euerill _and hee fall to share_.

    MER. Well, go, and seale, then, S^r, make your returne
    As speedy as you can.

              EVE. Come gi’ mee.

                   MER. Soft, Sir.

    EVE. Mary, and faire too, then. I’ll no delaying, Sir.         200

    MER. But, you will heare?

               EVE. Yes, when I haue my diuident.

    MER. Theres forty pieces for you.

               EVE. What is this for?                          [136]

    MER. Your halfe. You know, that _Guilt-head_ must ha’ twenty.

    EVE. And what’s your ring there? shall I ha’ none o’ that?

    MER. O, thats to be giuen to a _Lady_!                         205

    EVE. Is’t so?

          MER. By that good light, it is.

          EV. Come, gi’ me
    Ten pieces more, then.

                MER. Why?

                     EV. For _Guilt-head_? Sir,
    Do’you thinke, I’ll ’low him any such share:

                MER. You must.

    EVE. Must I? Doe you your musts, Sir, I’ll doe mine,
    You wi’ not part with the whole, Sir? Will you? Goe too.       210
    Gi’ me ten pieces!

                MER. By what law, doe you this?

    EVE. E’n Lyon-law, Sir, I must roare else.

                      MER. Good!

    EVE. Yo’ haue heard, how th’ _Asse_ made his diuisions, wisely?

    MER. And, I am he: I thanke you.

                 EV. Much good do you, S^r.

    MER. I shall be rid o’ this tyranny, one day?

                                     EVE. Not,
    While you doe eate; and lie, about the towne, here;            216
    And coozen i’ your bullions; and I stand
    Your name of credit, and compound your businesse;
    Adiourne your beatings euery terme; and make
    New parties for your proiects. I haue, now,                    220
    A pretty tasque, of it, to hold you in
    Wi’ your_ Lady Tayle-bush_: but the toy will be,
    How we shall both come off?

                   MER. Leaue you your doubting.
    And doe your portion, what’s assign’d you: I
    Neuer fail’d yet.

                        EVE. With reference to your aydes?         225
    You’ll still be vnthankfull. Where shall I meete you, anon?
    You ha’ some feate to doe alone, now, I see;
    You wish me gone, well, I will finde you out,
    And bring you after to the audit.

                                   MER. S’light!
    There’s _Ingines_ share too, I had forgot! This raigne         230
    Is too-too-vnsuportable! I must
    Quit my selfe of this vassalage! _Ingine!_ welcome.

MERE-CRAFT.   INGINE.   VVITTIPOL.

    How goes the cry?

            ING. Excellent well!

            MER. Wil’t do?
    VVhere’s _Robinson_?

                                ING. Here is the Gentleman, Sir.
    VVill vndertake t’himselfe. I haue acquainted him.

    MER. VVhy did you so?

        ING. VVhy, _Robinson_ would ha’ told him,
    You know. And hee’s a pleasant wit! will hurt                    5
    Nothing you purpose. Then, he’is of opinion,
    That _Robinson_ might want audacity,                      [129]
    She being such a gallant. Now, hee has beene,
    In _Spaine_, and knowes the fashions there; and can
    Discourse; and being but mirth (hee saies) leaue much,          10
    To his care:

               MER. But he is too tall!

                                  _He excepts at his stature._

                              ING. For that,
    He has the brauest deuice! (you’ll loue him for’t)
    To say, he weares _Cioppinos_: and they doe so
    In _Spaine_. And _Robinson’s_ as tall, as hee.

    MER. Is he so?

            ING. Euery iot.

                      MER. Nay, I had rather                        15
    To trust a Gentleman with it, o’ the two.

    ING. Pray you goe to him, then, Sir, and salute him.

    MER. Sir, my friend _Ingine_ has acquainted you
    With a strange _businesse_, here.

                                WIT. A merry one, Sir.
    The _Duke_ of _Drown’d-land_, and his _Dutchesse_?

                             MER. Yes, Sir.                         20
    Now, that the _Coniurers_ ha’ laid him by,
    I ha’ made bold, to borrow him a while;

    WIT. With purpose, yet, to put him out I hope
    To his best vse?

             MER. Yes, Sir.

                    WIT. For that small part,
    That I am trusted with, put off your care:                      25
    I would not lose to doe it, for the mirth,
    Will follow of it; and well, I haue a fancy.

    MER. Sir, that will make it well.

        WIT. You will report it so.
    Where must I haue my dressing?

            ING. At my house, Sir.

    MER. You shall haue caution, Sir, for what he yeelds,           30
    To six pence.

        WIT. You shall pardon me. I will share, Sir,
    I’ your sports, onely: nothing i’ your purchase.
    But you must furnish mee with complements,
    To th’ manner of _Spaine_; my coach, my _guarda duenn’as_;

    MER. _Ingine’s_ your _Pro’uedor_. But, Sir, I must              35
    (Now I’haue entred trust wi’ you, thus farre)
    Secure still i’ your quality, acquaint you
    With somewhat, beyond this. The place, design’d
    To be the _Scene_, for this our mery matter,
    Because it must haue countenance of women,                      40
    To draw discourse, and offer it, is here by,
    At the _Lady Taile-bushes_.

          WIT. I know her, Sir.
    And her Gentleman _huisher_.

                  MER. M^r _Ambler_?

                         WIT. Yes, Sir.

    MER. Sir, It shall be no shame to mee, to confesse
    To you, that wee poore Gentlemen, that want acres,              45
    Must for our needs, turne fooles vp, and plough _Ladies_
    Sometimes, to try what glebe they are: and this
    Is no vnfruitefull piece. She, and I now,
    Are on a proiect, for the fact, and venting
    Of a new kinde of _fucus_ (paint, for _Ladies_)                 50
    To serue the kingdome: wherein shee her selfe
    Hath trauell’d, specially, by way of seruice
    Vnto her sexe, and hopes to get the _Monopoly_,
    As the reward of her inuention.                          [138]

    WIT. What is her end, in this?

                                 EV. Merely ambition,               55
    Sir, to grow great, and court it with the secret:
    Though shee pretend some other. For, she’s dealing,
    Already, vpon caution for the shares,
    And M^r. _Ambler_, is hee nam’d _Examiner_
    For the ingredients; and the _Register_                         60
    Of what is vented; and shall keepe the _Office_.
    Now, if shee breake with you, of this (as I
    Must make the leading thred to your acquaintance,
    That, how experience gotten i’ your being
    Abroad, will helpe our businesse) thinke of some                65
    Pretty additions, but to keep her floting:
    It may be, shee will offer you a part,
    Any strange names of--

          WIT. S^r, I haue my instructions.
    Is it not high time to be making ready?

    MER. Yes, Sir.

          ING. The foole’s in sight, _Dottrel_.

    MER. Away, then.                                                70

    But there’s not so much gold in all the row, he saies--
    Till’t come fro’ the Mint. ’Tis tane vp for the gamesters.

    MER. There’s a shop-shift! plague on ’hem.

                   FIT. He do’s sweare it.

    MER. He’ll sweare, and forsweare too, it is his trade,           5
    You should not haue left him.

      FIT. S’lid, I can goe backe,
    And beat him, yet.

           MER. No, now let him alone.

    FIT. I was so earnest, after the maine _Businesse_,
    To haue this ring, gone.

               MER. True, and ’tis time.
    I’haue learned, Sir, sin’ you went, her _Ladi-ship_ eats        10
    With the _Lady Tail-bush_, here, hard by.

                     FIT. I’ the lane here?

    MER. Yes, if you’had a seruant, now of prefence,
    Well cloth’d, and of an aëry voluble tongue,
    Neither too bigge, or little for his mouth,
    That could deliuer your wiues complement;                       15
    To send along withall.

                     FIT. I haue one Sir,
    A very handsome, gentleman-like-fellow,
    That I doe meane to make my _Dutchesse Vsher_--
    I entertain’d him, but this morning, too:
    I’ll call him to you. The worst of him, is his name!            20

    MER. She’ll take no note of that, but of his message.     [139]

                                       _Hee shewes him his_ Pug.

    FIT. _Diuell!_ How like you him, Sir. Pace, go a little.
    Let’s see you moue.

           MER. He’ll serue, S^r, giue it him:
    And let him goe along with mee, I’ll helpe
    To present him, and it.

                    FIT. Looke, you doe sirah,                      25
    Discharge this well, as you expect your place.
    Do’you heare, goe on, come off with all your honours.
                                      _Giues him instructions._
    I would faine see him, do it.

                    MER. Trust him, with it;

    FIT. Remember kissing of your hand, and answering
    With the _French_-time, in flexure of your body.                30
    I could now so instruct him--and for his words--

    MER. I’ll put them in his mouth.

        FIT. O, but I haue ’hem
    O’ the very _Academies_.

              MER. Sir, you’ll haue vse for ’hem,
    Anon, your selfe, I warrant you: after dinner,
    When you are call’d.

             FIT. S’light, that’ll be iust _play_-time.             35
                                      _He longs to see the_ play.
    It cannot be, I must not lose the _play_!

    MER. Sir, but you must, if she appoint to sit.
    And, shee’s president.

             FIT. S’lid, it is the _Diuell_.

                                 _Because it is the_ Diuell.

    MER. And, ’twere his Damme too, you must now apply
    Your selfe, Sir, to this, wholly; or lose all.                  40

    FIT. If I could but see a piece--

             MER. S^r. Neuer think on’t.

    FIT. Come but to one act, and I did not care--
    But to be seene to rise, and goe away,
    To vex the Players, and to punish their _Poet_--
    Keepe him in awe!

                   MER. But say, that he be one,                    45
    Wi’ not be aw’d! but laugh at you. How then?

    FIT. Then he shall pay for his’dinner himselfe.

                              MER. Perhaps,
    He would doe that twice, rather then thanke you.
    Come, get the _Diuell_ out of your head, my _Lord_,
    (I’ll call you so in priuate still) and take                    50
    Your _Lord-ship_ i’ your minde. You were, sweete _Lord_,
                              _He puts him in mind of his quarrell._
    In talke to bring a _Businesse_ to the _Office_.

                FIT. Yes.

    MER. Why should not you, S^r, carry it o’ your selfe,
    Before the _Office_ be vp? and shew the world,
    You had no need of any mans direction;                          55
    In point, Sir, of sufficiency. I speake
    Against a kinsman, but as one that tenders
    Your graces good.

               FIT. I thanke you; to proceed--

    MER. To _Publications_: ha’ your _Deed_ drawne presently.
    And leaue a blancke to put in your _Feoffees_                   60
    One, two, or more, as you see cause--

                       FIT. I thank you
    Heartily, I doe thanke you. Not a word more,
    I pray you, as you loue mee. Let mee alone.
    That I could not thinke o’ this, as well, as hee?
    O, I could beat my infinite blocke-head--!                      65

                                _He is angry with himselfe._

    MER. Come, we must this way.

           PVG. How far is’t.

                 MER. Hard by here
    Ouer the way. Now, to atchieue this ring,
    From this same fellow, that is to assure it;             [140]
               _He thinkes how to coozen the bearer, of the ring._
    Before hee giue it. Though my _Spanish Lady_,
    Be a young Gentleman of meanes, and scorne                      70
    To share, as hee doth say, I doe not know
    How such a toy may tempt his _Lady-ship_:
    And therefore, I thinke best, it be assur’d.

    PVG. Sir, be the _Ladies_ braue, wee goe vnto?

    MER. O, yes.

         PVG. And shall I see ’hem, and speake to ’hem?             75

    MER. What else? ha’ you your false-beard about you? _Traines._

                                              _Questions his man._

    TRA. Yes.

    MER. And is this one of your double Cloakes?

                              _Offers to kisse._

    PIT. Away. MER. I’ll set thee vp again.
    Neuer feare that: canst thou get ne’r a bird?
    No _Thrushes_ hungry? Stay, till cold weather come,
    I’ll help thee to an _Ousell_, or, a _Field-fare_.
    Who’s within, with Madame?

              PIT. I’ll tell you straight.                           5

                            _She runs in, in haste: he followes._

    MER. Please you stay here, a while Sir, I’le goe in.

    PVG. I doe so long to haue a little venery,
    While I am in this body! I would tast
    Of euery sinne, a little, if it might be
    After the māner of man! _Sweet-heart!_

               PIT. What would you, S^r?                            10

                           Pug _leaps at_ Pitfall’s _comming in_.

    PVG. Nothing but fall in, to you, be your Black-bird,
    My pretty pit (as the Gentleman said) your _Throstle_:
    Lye tame, and taken with you; here’is gold!
    To buy you so much new stuffes, from the shop,
    As I may take the old vp--

          TRA. You must send, Sir.                                  15
    The Gentleman the ring.

                     Traine’s _in his false cloak, brings a false
                       message, and gets the ring_.

    PVG. There ’tis. Nay looke,
    Will you be foolish, _Pit_.

                PIT. This is strange rudenesse.

    PVG. Deare _Pit_.

                PIT. I’ll call, I sweare.

                    Mere-craft _followes presently, and askes for it_.

                 MER. Where are you, S^r?
    Is your ring ready? Goe with me.

                 PVG. I sent it you.

    MER. Me? When? by whom?

      PVG. A fellow here, e’en now,                                 20
    Came for it i’ your name.

                      MER. I sent none, sure.
    My meaning euer was, you should deliuer it,
    Your selfe: So was your Masters charge, you know.
                              _Ent._ Train’s _as himselfe againe_.
    What fellow was it, doe you know him?

         PVG. Here,
    But now, he had it.

              MER. Saw you any? _Traines_?                          25

    TRA. Not I.

              PVG. The Gentleman saw him.

                  MER. Enquire.

    PVG. I was so earnest vpon her, I mark’d not!
                   _The_ Diuell _confesseth himselfe coozen’d_.
    My diuellish _Chiefe_ has put mee here in flesh,          [141]
    To shame mee! This dull body I am in,
    I perceiue nothing with! I offer at nothing,                    30
    That will succeed!

              TRA. Sir, she saw none, she saies.

    PVG. _Satan_ himselfe, has tane a shape t’abuse me.
    It could not be else.

              MER. This is aboue strange!
                              Mere-craft _accuseth him of negligence_.
    That you should be so retchlesse. What’ll you do, Sir?
    How will you answer this, when you are question’d?              35

    PVG. Run from my flesh, if I could: put off mankind!
    This’s such a scorne! and will be a new exercise,
    For my _Arch-Duke_! Woe to the seuerall cudgells,
    Must suffer, on this backe! Can you no succours? Sir?           39

                                        _He asketh ayde._

    MER. Alas! the vse of it is so present.

                           PVG. I aske,
    Sir, credit for another, but till to morrow?

    MER. There is not so much time, Sir. But how euer,
    The lady is a noble Lady, and will
    (To saue a Gentleman from check) be intreated
                     Mere-craft _promiseth faintly, yet comforts him_.
    To say, she ha’s receiu’d it.

    PVG. Do you thinke so?                                          45
    Will shee be won?

              MER. No doubt, to such an office,
    It will be a Lady’s brauery, and her pride.

    PVG. And not be knowne on’t after, vnto him?

    MER. That were a treachery! Vpon my word,
    Be confident. Returne vnto your master,                         50
    My _Lady President_ sits this after-noone,
    Ha’s tane the ring, commends her seruices
    Vnto your _Lady-Dutchesse_. You may say
    She’s a ciuill _Lady_, and do’s giue her
    All her respects, already: Bad you, tell her                    55
    She liues, but to receiue her wish’d commandements,
    And haue the honor here to kisse her hands:
    For which shee’ll stay this houre yet. Hasten you
    Your _Prince_, away.

    PVG. And Sir, you will take care
    Th’ excuse be perfect?

        MER. You confesse your feares.                              60
                      _The_ Diuel _is doubtfull_.
    Too much.

              PVG. The shame is more, I’ll quit you of either.

    TAY. Why, there was S^r. _Iohn Monie-man_ could iump
    A _Businesse_ quickely.

                        MER. True, hee had great friends,
    But, because some, sweete _Madame_, can leape ditches,
    Wee must not all shunne to goe ouer bridges.
    The harder parts, I make account are done:                      10
                                          _He flatters her._
    Now, ’tis referr’d. You are infinitly bound
    Vnto’the _Ladies_, they ha’ so cri’d it vp!

    TAY. Doe they like it then?

    MER. They ha’ sent the _Spanish-Lady_,
    To gratulate with you--

      TAY. I must send ’hem thankes
    And some remembrances.

      MER. That you must, and visit ’hem.                           15
    Where’s _Ambler_?

         TAY. Lost, to day, we cannot heare of him.

    MER. Not _Madam_?

             TAY. No in good faith. They say he lay not
    At home, to night. And here has fall’n a _Businesse_
    Betweene your Cousin, and Master _Manly_, has
    Vnquieted vs all.

    MER. So I heare, _Madame_.                                      20
    Pray you how was it?

                     TAY. Troth, it but appeares
    Ill o’ your Kinsmans part. You may haue heard,
    That _Manly_ is a sutor to me, I doubt not:

    MER. I guess’d it, _Madame_.

                   TAY. And it seemes, he trusted
    Your Cousin to let fall some faire reports                      25
    Of him vnto mee.

            MER. Which he did!

                               TAY. So farre
    From it, as hee came in, and tooke him rayling
    Against him.

            MER. How! And what said _Manly_ to him?

    TAY. Inough, I doe assure you: and with that scorne
    Of him, and the iniury, as I doe wonder                         30
    How _Euerill_ bore it! But that guilt vndoe’s
    Many mens valors.

            MER. Here comes _Manly_.

         MAN. _Madame_,                                       [143]
    I’ll take my leaue--

                      Manly _offers to be gone_.

           TAY. You sha’ not goe, i’ faith.
    I’ll ha’ you stay, and see this _Spanish_ miracle,
    Of our _English Ladie_.

            MAN. Let me pray your _Ladiship_,                       35
    Lay your commands on me, some other time.

    TAY. Now, I protest: and I will haue all piec’d,
    And friends againe.

            MAN. It will be but ill solder’d!

    TAY. You are too much affected with it.

                              MAN. I cannot
    _Madame_, but thinke on’t for th’ iniustice.

              TAY. Sir,                                             40
    His kinsman here is sorry.

                      MER. Not I, _Madam_,
    I am no kin to him, wee but call Cousins,
                                  Mere-craft _denies him_.
    And if wee were, Sir, I haue no relation
    Vnto his crimes.

                  MAN. You are not vrged with ’hem.
    I can accuse, Sir, none but mine owne iudgement,                45
    For though it were his crime, so to betray mee:
    I am sure, ’twas more mine owne, at all to trust him.
    But he, therein, did vse but his old manners,
    And fauour strongly what hee was before.

    TAY. Come, he will change!

        MAN. Faith, I must neuer think it.                          50
    Nor were it reason in mee to expect
    That for my sake, hee should put off a nature
    Hee suck’d in with his milke. It may be _Madam_,
    Deceiuing trust, is all he has to trust to:
    If so, I shall be loath, that any hope                          55
    Of mine, should bate him of his meanes.

         TAY. Yo’ are sharp, Sir.
    This act may make him honest!

                               MAN. If he were
    To be made honest, by an act of _Parliament_,
    I should not alter, i’ my faith of him.

                                     TAY. _Eyther-side!_
    Welcome, deare _Either-side_! how hast thou done, good wench?
                                  _She spies the_ Lady Eyther-side.
    Thou hast beene a stranger! I ha’ not seene thee, this weeke.   61


ACT. IIIJ. SCENE. II.

EITHERSIDE. {_To them_

    Ever your seruant, _Madame_.

      TAY. Where hast ’hou beene?              [144]
    I did so long to see thee.

                     EIT. Visiting, and so tyr’d!
    I protest, _Madame_, ’tis a monstrous trouble!

    TAY. And so it is. I sweare I must to morrow,
    Beginne my visits (would they were ouer) at _Court_.             5
    It tortures me, to thinke on ’hem.

                         EIT. I doe heare
    You ha’ cause, Madam, your sute goes on.

                TAY. Who told thee?

    EYT. One, that can tell: M^r. _Eyther-side_.

                                  TAY. O, thy husband!
    Yes, faith, there’s life in’t, now: It is referr’d.
    If wee once see it vnder the seales, wench, then,               10
    Haue with ’hem for the great _Carroch_, sixe horses,
    And the two _Coach-men_, with my _Ambler_, bare,
    And my three women: wee will liue, i’ faith,
    The examples o’ the towne, and gouerne it.
    I’le lead the fashion still.

    EIT. You doe that, now,                                         15
    Sweet _Madame_.

                      TAY. O, but then, I’ll euery day
    Bring vp some new deuice. Thou and I, _Either-side_,
    Will first be in it. I will giue it thee;
    And they shall follow vs. Thou shalt, I sweare,
    Weare euery moneth a new gowne, out of it.                      20

    EITH. Thanke you good _Madame_.

                   TAY. Pray thee call mee _Taile-bush_
    As I thee, _Either-side_: I not loue this, _Madame_.

    ETY. Then I protest to you, _Taile-bush_, I am glad
    Your _Businesse_ so succeeds.

                     TAY. Thanke thee, good _Eyther-side_.

    ETY. But Master _Either-side_ tells me, that he likes           25
    Your other _Businesse_ better.

        TAY. Which?

             EIT. O’ the Tooth-picks.

    TAY. I neuer heard on’t.

              EIT. Aske M^r. _Mere-craft_.

    MER. _Madame?_ H’is one, in a word, I’ll trust his malice,
    With any mans credit, I would haue abus’d!

                      Mere-craft _hath whisper’d with the while_.

    MAN. Sir, if you thinke you doe please mee, in this,            30
    You are deceiu’d!

                MER. No, but because my _Lady_,
    Nam’d him my kinsman; I would satisfie you,
    What I thinke of him: and pray you, vpon it
    To iudge mee!

    MAN. So I doe: that ill mens friendship,
    Is as vnfaithfull, as themselues.

                         TAY. Doe you heare?                        35
    Ha’ you a _Businesse_ about Tooth-picks?

                                 MER. Yes, _Madame_.
    Did I ne’r tell’t you? I meant to haue offer’d it
    Your _Lady-ship_, on the perfecting the pattent.         [145]

    TAY. How is’t!

         MER. For seruing the whole state with Tooth-picks;
                               _The_ Proiect _for_ Tooth-picks.
    (Somewhat an intricate _Businesse_ to discourse) but--          40
    I shew, how much the Subiect is abus’d,
    First, in that one commodity? then what diseases,
    And putrefactions in the gummes are bred,
    By those are made of adultrate, and false wood?
    My plot, for reformation of these, followes.                    45
    To haue all Tooth-picks, brought vnto an _office_,
    There seal’d; and such as counterfait ’hem, mulcted.
    And last, for venting ’hem to haue a booke
    Printed, to teach their vse, which euery childe
    Shall haue throughout the kingdome, that can read,              50
    And learne to picke his teeth by. Which beginning
    Earely to practice, with some other rules,
    Of neuer sleeping with the mouth open, chawing
    Some graines of _masticke_, will preserue the breath
    Pure, and so free from taynt--ha’ what is’t? saist thou?

                                  Traines _his man whispers him_.

    TAY. Good faith, it sounds a very pretty _Bus’nesse_!           56

    EIT. So M^r. _Either-side_ saies, _Madame_.

                       MER. The _Lady_ is come.

    TAY. Is she? Good, waite vpon her in. My _Ambler_
    Was neuer so ill absent. _Either-side_,
    How doe I looke to day? Am I not drest,                         60
    Spruntly?

                            _She lookes in her glasse._

    EIT. Yes, verily, _Madame_.

         TAY. Pox o’ _Madame_, Will you not leaue that?

            EIT. Yes, good _Taile-bush_.

                                         TAY. So?
    Sounds not that better? What vile _Fucus_ is this,
    Thou hast got on?

            EIT. ’Tis _Pearle_.

                      TAY. _Pearle?_ _Oyster-shells_:
    As I breath, _Either-side_, I know’t. Here comes                65
    (They say) a wonder, sirrah, has beene in _Spaine_!
    Will teach vs all; shee’s sent to mee, from _Court_.
    To gratulate with mee! Pr’y thee, let’s obserue her,
    What faults she has, that wee may laugh at ’hem,
    When she is gone.

          EIT. That we will heartily, _Tail-bush_.                  70

                                    Wittipol _enters_.

    TAY. O, mee! the very _Infanta_ of the _Giants_!



ACT. IIIJ. SCENE. IJI.

MERE-CRAFT.   WITTIPOL. } to them.

               Wittipol _is drest like a_ Spanish Lady.
    MER. Here is a noble _Lady_, _Madame_, come,               [146]
    From your great friends, at _Court_, to see your _Ladi-ship_:
    And haue the honour of your acquaintance.

         TAY. Sir.
    She do’s vs honour.

              WIT. Pray you, say to her _Ladiship_,
    It is the manner of _Spaine_, to imbrace onely,                  5
    Neuer to kisse. She will excuse the custome!

                           _Excuses him selfe for not kissing._

    TAY. Your vse of it is law. Please you, sweete, _Madame_,
    To take a seate.

                WIT. Yes, _Madame_. I’haue had
    The fauour, through a world of faire report
    To know your vertues, _Madame_; and in that                     10
    Name, haue desir’d the happinesse of presenting
    My seruice to your _Ladiship_!

    TAY. Your loue, _Madame_,
    I must not owne it else.

       WIT. Both are due, _Madame_,
    To your great vndertakings.

                     TAY. Great? In troth, _Madame_,
    They are my friends, that thinke ’hem any thing:                15
    If I can doe my sexe (by ’hem) any seruice,
    I’haue my ends, _Madame_.

               WIT. And they are noble ones,
    That make a multitude beholden, _Madame_:
    The common-wealth of _Ladies_, must acknowledge from you.

    EIT. Except some enuious, _Madame_.

           WIT. Yo’ are right in that, _Madame_,                    20
    Of which race, I encountred some but lately.
    Who (’t seemes) haue studyed reasons to discredit
    Your _businesse_.

               TAY. How, sweet _Madame_.

                             WIT. Nay, the parties
    Wi’ not be worth your pause--Most ruinous things, _Madame_,
    That haue put off all hope of being recouer’d                   25
    To a degree of handsomenesse.

    TAY. But their reasons, _Madame_?
    I would faine heare.

                      WIT. Some _Madame_, I remember.
    They say, that painting quite destroyes the face--

    EIT. O, that’s an old one, _Madame_.

                          WIT. There are new ones, too.
    Corrupts the breath; hath left so little sweetnesse             30
    In kissing, as ’tis now vs’d, but for fashion:
    And shortly will be taken for a punishment.
    Decayes the fore-teeth, that should guard the tongue;
    And suffers that runne riot euer-lasting!
    And (which is worse) some _Ladies_ when they meete              35
    Cannot be merry, and laugh, but they doe spit
    In one anothers faces!

          MAN. I should know
    This voyce, and face too:

                          Manly _begins to know him_.

               VVIT. Then they say, ’tis dangerous          [147]
    To all the falne, yet well dispos’d _Mad-dames_,
    That are industrious, and desire to earne                       40
    Their liuing with their sweate! For any distemper
    Of heat, and motion, may displace the colours;
    And if the paint once runne about their faces,
    Twenty to one, they will appeare so ill-fauour’d,
    Their seruants run away, too, and leaue the pleasure            45
    Imperfect, and the reckoning all vnpay’d.

    EIT. Pox, these are _Poets_ reasons.

                                TAY. Some old _Lady_
    That keepes a _Poet_, has deuis’d these scandales.

    EIT. Faith we must haue the _Poets_ banish’d, _Madame_,
    As Master _Either-side_ saies.

                               MER. Master _Fitz-dottrel_?          50
    And his wife: where? _Madame_, the _Duke_ of _Drown’d-land_,
    That will be shortly.

        VVIT. Is this my _Lord_?

              MER. The same.

    Your seruant, _Madame_!

    VVIT. How now? Friend? offended,
    That I haue found your haunt here?

                       Wittipol _whispers with_ Manly.

                  MAN. No, but wondring
    At your strange fashion’d venture, hither.

                          VVIT. It is
    To shew you what they are, you so pursue.

    MAN. I thinke ’twill proue a med’cine against marriage;
    To know their manners.

                     VVIT. Stay, and profit then.                    6

    MER. The _Lady_, _Madame_, whose _Prince_ has brought her, here,
    To be instructed.

                             _Hee presents Mistresse_ Fitz-dottrel.

          VVIT. Please you sit with vs, _Lady_.

    MER. That’s _Lady-President_.

             FIT. A goodly woman!
    I cannot see the ring, though.

                MER. Sir, she has it.                               10

    TAY. But, _Madame_, these are very feeble reasons!

    WIT. So I vrg’d _Madame_, that the new complexion,
    Now to come forth, in name o’ your _Ladiship’s fucus_,
    Had no _ingredient_--

           TAY. But I durst eate, I assure you.

    WIT. So do they, in _Spaine_.

            TAY. Sweet _Madam_ be so liberall,                      15
    To giue vs some o’ your _Spanish Fucuses_!

    VVIT. They are infinit, _Madame_.

                             TAY. So I heare, they haue
    VVater of _Gourdes_, of _Radish_, the white _Beanes_,
    Flowers of _Glasse_, of _Thistles_, _Rose-marine_.
    Raw _Honey_, _Mustard-seed_, and Bread dough-bak’d, 20
    The crums o’ bread, _Goats-milke_, and whites of _Egges_,
    _Campheere_, and _Lilly-roots_, the fat of _Swannes_,
    Marrow of _Veale_, white _Pidgeons_, and pine-_kernells_,  [148]
    The seedes of _Nettles_, _perse’line_, and _hares gall_.
    _Limons_, thin-skind--

    EIT. How, her _Ladiship_ has studied                            25
    Al excellent things!

                 VVIT. But ordinary, _Madame_.
    No, the true rarities, are th’ _Aluagada_,
    And _Argentata_ of Queene _Isabella_!

    TAY. I, what are their _ingredients_, gentle _Madame_?

    WIT. Your _Allum Scagliola_, or _Pol-dipedra_;                  30
    And _Zuccarino_; _Turpentine_ of _Abezzo_,
    Wash’d in nine waters: _Soda di leuante_,
    Or your _Ferne_ ashes; _Beniamin di gotta_;
    _Grasso di serpe_; _Porcelletto marino_;
    Oyles of _Lentisco_; _Zucche Mugia_; make                       35
    The admirable _Vernish_ for the face,
    Giues the right luster; but two drops rub’d on
    VVith a piece of scarlet, makes a _Lady_ of sixty
    Looke at sixteen. But, aboue all, the water
    Of the white _Hen_, of the _Lady Estifanias_!                   40

    TAY. O, I, that same, good _Madame_, I haue heard of:
    How is it done?

              VVIT. _Madame_, you take your _Hen_,
    Plume it, and skin it, cleanse it o’ the inwards:
    Then chop it, bones and all: adde to foure ounces
    Of _Carrauicins_, _Pipitas_, _Sope_ of _Cyprus_,                45
    Make the decoction, streine it. Then distill it,
    And keep it in your galley-pot well glidder’d:
    Three drops preserues from wrinkles, warts, spots, moles,
    Blemish, or Sun-burnings, and keepes the skin
    _In decimo sexto_, euer bright, and smooth,                     50
    As any looking-glasse; and indeed, is call’d
    The Virgins milke for the face, _Oglio reale_;
    A Ceruse, neyther cold or heat, will hurt;
    And mixt with oyle of _myrrhe_, and the red _Gilli-flower_
    Call’d _Cataputia_; and flowers of _Rouistico_;                 55
    Makes the best _muta_, or dye of the whole world.

    TAY. Deare _Madame_, will you let vs be familiar?

    WIT. Your _Ladiships_ seruant.

          MER. How do you like her.

                FIT. Admirable!
    But, yet, I cannot see the ring.

    _Hee is iealous about his_ ring, _and_ Mere-craft _deliuers it._

                PVG. Sir.

                                 MER. I must
    Deliuer it, or marre all. This foole’s so iealous.              60
    _Madame_--Sir, weare this ring, and pray you take knowledge,
    ’Twas sent you by his wife. And giue her thanks,
    Doe not you dwindle, Sir, beare vp.

               PVG. I thanke you, Sir.

    TAY. But for the manner of _Spaine_! Sweet, _Madame_, let vs
    Be bold, now we are in: Are all the _Ladies_,                   65
    There, i’ the fashion?

                        VVIT. None but _Grandee’s_, _Madame_,
    O’ the clasp’d traine, which may be worne at length, too,
    Or thus, vpon my arme.

    TAY. And doe they weare
    _Cioppino’s_ all?

                  VVIT. If they be drest in _punto_, _Madame_.

    EIT. Guilt as those are? _madame?_

                        WIT. Of Goldsmiths work, _madame_;  [149]   70
    And set with diamants: and their _Spanish_ pumps
    Of perfum’d leather.

    TAI. I should thinke it hard
    To go in ’hem, _madame_.

              WIT. At the first, it is, _madame_.

    TAI. Do you neuer fall in ’hem?

              WIT. Neuer.

    EI. I sweare, I should
    Six times an houre.

    WIT. But you haue men at hand, sstill,
    To helpe you, if you fall?

                  EIT. Onely one, madame,                           76
    The _Guardo-duennas_, such a little old man,
    As this.

            EIT. Alas! hee can doe nothing! this!

    WIT. I’ll tell you, madame,
            I saw i’ the _Court_ of _Spaine_ once,
    A _Lady_ fall i’ the Kings sight, along,                        80
    And there shee lay, flat spred, as an _Vmbrella_,
    Her hoope here crack’d; no man durst reach a hand
    To helpe her, till the _Guarda-duenn’as_ came,
    VVho is the person onel’ allow’d to touch
    A _Lady_ there: and he but by this finger.                      85

    EIT. Ha’ they no seruants, _madame_, there? nor friends?

    WIT. An _Escudero_, or so _madame_, that wayts
    Vpon ’hem in another Coach, at distance,
    And when they walke, or daunce, holds by a hand-kercher,
    Neuer presumes to touch ’hem.

                         EIT. This’s sciruy!                        90
    And a forc’d grauity! I doe not like it.
    I like our owne much better.

    TAY. ’Tis more _French_,
    And _Courtly_ ours.

                    EIT. And tasts more liberty.
    VVe may haue our doozen of visiters, at once,
    Make loue t’vs.

             TAY. And before our husbands?

                                EIT. Husband?                       95
    As I am honest, _Tayle-bush_ I doe thinke
    If no body should loue mee, but my poore husband,
    I should e’n hang my selfe.

                       TAY. Fortune forbid, wench:
    So faire a necke should haue so foule a neck-lace.

    EIT. ’Tis true, as I am handsome!

                 WIT. I receiu’d, _Lady_,                          100
    A token from you, which I would not bee
    Rude to refuse, being your first remembrance.

                      (FIT. O, I am satisfied now!
                       MER. Do you see it, Sir.)

    WIT. But since you come, to know me, neerer, _Lady_,
    I’ll begge the honour, you will weare for mee,                 105
    It must be so.

                 Wittipol _giues it Mistresse_ Fitz-dottrel.

    M^rs. FIT. Sure I haue heard this tongue.

    MER. What do you meane, S^r?

                                 Mere-craft _murmures,_

               WIT. Would you ha’ me mercenary?
    We’ll recompence it anon, in somewhat else.

                                _He is satisfied, now he sees it._

    FIT. I doe not loue to be gull’d, though in a toy.
    VVife, doe you heare? yo’ are come into the Schole, wife,
    VVhere you may learne, I doe perceiue it, any thing!           111
    How to be fine, or faire, or great, or proud,
    Or what you will, indeed, wife; heere ’tis taught.
    And I am glad on’t, that you may not say,
    Another day, when honours come vpon you,                       115
    You wanted meanes. I ha’ done my parts: beene,
    Today at fifty pound charge, first, for a ring,          [150]
                    _He vpbraids her, with his Bill of costs._
    To get you entred. Then left my new _Play_,
    To wait vpon you, here, to see’t confirm’d.
    That I may say, both to mine owne eyes, and eares,             120
    Senses, you are my witnesse, sha’ hath inioy’d
    All helps that could be had, for loue, or money--

    M^rs. FIT. To make a foole of her.

    FIT. Wife, that’s your malice,
    The wickednesse o’ you nature to interpret
    Your husbands kindesse thus. But I’ll not leaue;               125
    Still to doe good, for your deprau’d affections:
    Intend it. Bend this stubborne will; be great.

    TAY. Good _Madame_, whom do they vse in messages?

    WIT. They comonly vse their slaues, _Madame_.

    TAI. And do’s your _Ladiship_.
    Thinke that so good, _Madame_?

                       WIT. no, indeed, _Madame_; I,               130
    Therein preferre the fashion of _England_ farre,
    Of your young delicate Page, or discreet Vsher.

    FIT. And I goe with your _Ladiship_, in opinion,
    Directly for your Gentleman-vsher.
    There’s not a finer _Officer_ goes on ground.                  135

    WIT. If hee be made and broken to his place, once.

    FIT. Nay, so I presuppose him.

                   WIT. And they are fitter
    Managers too, Sir, but I would haue ’hem call’d
    Our _Escudero’s_.

                FIT. Good.

                          WIT. Say, I should send
    To your _Ladiship_, who (I presume) has gather’d               140
    All the deare secrets, to know how to make
    _Pastillos_ of the _Dutchesse_ of _Braganza_,
    _Coquettas_, _Almoiauana’s_, _Mantecada’s_,
    _Alcoreas_, _Mustaccioli_; or say it were
    The _Peladore_ of _Isabella_, or _balls_                       145
    Against the itch, or _aqua nanfa_, or _oyle_
    Of _Iessamine_ for gloues, of the _Marquesse Muja_:
    Or for the head, and hayre: why, these are _offices_.

    FIT. Fit for a gentleman, not a slaue. They onely
    Might aske for your _pineti_, _Spanish_-cole,                  150
    To burne, and sweeten a roome; but the _Arcana_
    Of _Ladies_ Cabinets--

                      FIT. Should be else-where trusted.
    Yo’ are much about the truth. Sweet honoured _Ladies_,
                              _He enters himselfe with the_ Ladies.
    Let mee fall in wi’ you. I’ha’ my female wit,
    As well as my male. And I doe know what sutes                  155
    A _Lady_ of spirit, or a woman of fashion!

    WIT. And you would haue your wife such.

                   FIT. Yes, _Madame_, aërie,
    Light; not to plaine dishonesty, I meane:
    But, somewhat o’ this side.

                             WIT. I take you, Sir.
    H’has reason _Ladies_. I’ll not giue this rush                 160
    For any _Lady_, that cannot be honest
    Within a thred.

    TAY. Yes, _Madame_, and yet venter
    As far for th’other, in her Fame--

                                     WIT. As can be;
    Coach it to _Pimlico_; daunce the _Saraband_;           [151]
    Heare, and talke bawdy; laugh as loud, as a larum;             165
    Squeake, spring, do any thing.

              EIT. In young company, _Madame_.

    TAY. Or afore gallants. If they be braue, or _Lords_,
    A woman is ingag’d.

             FIT. I say so, _Ladies_,
    It is ciuility to deny vs nothing.

    PVG. You talke of a _Vniuersity_! why, _Hell_ is               170
    A Grammar-schoole to this!

                              _The_ Diuell _admires him_.

                             EIT. But then,
    Shee must not lose a looke on stuffes, or cloth, _Madame_.

    TAY. Nor no course fellow.

                WIT. She must be guided, _Madame_
    By the clothes he weares, and company he is in;
    Whom to salute, how farre--

                  FIT. I ha’ told her this.                        175
    And how that bawdry too, vpo’ the point,
    Is (in it selfe) as ciuill a discourse--

    WIT. As any other affayre of flesh, what euer.

    FIT. But shee will ne’r be capable, shee is not
    So much as comming, _Madame_; I know not how                   180
    She loses all her opportunities
    With hoping to be forc’d. I’haue entertain’d
                                      _He shews his_ Pug.
    A gentleman, a younger brother, here,
    Whom I would faine breed vp, her _Escudero_,
    Against some expectation’s that I haue,                        185
    And she’ll not countenance him.

             WIT. What’s his name?

    FIT. _Diuel_, o’ _Darbi-shire_.

             EIT. Blesse us from him!

    TAY. _Diuell?_
    Call him _De-uile_, sweet _Madame_.

            M^rs. FI. What you please, _Ladies_.

    TAY. _De-uile’s_ a prettier name!

             EIT. And sounds, me thinks,
    As it came in with the _Conquerour_--

                                   MAN. Ouer smocks!               190
    What things they are? That nature should be at leasure
    Euer to make ’hem! my woing is at an end.

                               Manly _goes out with indignation_.

    WIT. What can he do?

            EIT. Let’s heare him.

                   TAY. Can he manage?

    FIT. Please you to try him, _Ladies_. Stand forth, _Diuell_.

    PVG. Was all this but the preface to my torment?               195

    FIT. Come, let their _Ladiships_ see your honours.

           EIT. O,
    Hee makes a wicked leg.

               TAY. As euer I saw!

    WIT. Fit for a _Diuell_.

                TAY. Good _Madame_, call him _De-uile_.

    WIT. _De-uile_, what property is there most required
    I’ your conceit, now, in the _Escudero_?                       200

                                 _They begin their_ Catechisme.

    FIT. Why doe you not speake?

              PVG. A setled discreet pase, _Madame_.

    WIT. I thinke, a barren head, Sir, Mountaine-like,
    To be expos’d to the cruelty of weathers--

    FIT. I, for his Valley is beneath the waste, _Madame_,
    And to be fruitfull there, it is sufficient.                   205
    Dulnesse vpon you! Could not you hit this?

    PVG. Good Sir--

                                       _He strikes him._

          WIT. He then had had no barren head.
    You daw him too much, in troth, Sir.

                     FIT. I must walke
    With the _French_ sticke, like an old vierger for you.

    PVG. O, _Chiefe_, call mee to _Hell_ againe, and free mee.     210

                                          _The_ Diuell _prayes_.

    FIT. Do you murmur now?

           PVG. Not I, S^r.

                   WIT. What do you take                     [152]
    M^r. _Deuile_, the height of your employment,
    In the true perfect _Escudero_?

           FIT. When?
    What doe you answer?

                    PVG. To be able, _Madame_,
    First to enquire, then report the working,                     215
    Of any _Ladies_ physicke, in sweete phrase.

    WIT. Yes, that’s an act of elegance, and importance.
    But what aboue?

             FIT. O, that I had a goad for him.

    PVG. To find out a good _Corne-cutter_.

             TAY. Out on him!

    EIT. Most barbarous!

                    FIT. Why did you doe this, now?                220
    Of purpose to discredit me? you damn’d _Diuell_.

    PVG. Sure, if I be not yet, I shall be. All
    My daies in _Hell_, were holy-daies to this!

    TAY. ’Tis labour lost, _Madame_?

    EIT. H’is a dull fellow
    Of no capacity!

                TAI. Of no discourse!                              225
    O, if my _Ambler_ had beene here!

                       EIT. I, _Madame_;
    You talke of a man, where is there such another?

    WIT. M^r. _Deuile_, put case, one of my _Ladies_, heere,
    Had a fine brach: and would imploy you forth
    To treate ’bout a conuenient match for her.                    230
    What would you obserue?

            PVG. The color, and the size, _Madame_.

    WIT. And nothing else?

            FIT. The Moon, you calfe, the Moone!

    WIT. I, and the Signe.

            TAI. Yes, and receits for pronenesse.

    WIT. Then when the _Puppies_ came, what would you doe?

    PVG. Get their natiuities cast!

            WIT. This’s wel. What more?                            235

    PVG. Consult the _Almanack-man_ which would be least?
    Which cleaneliest?

           WIT. And which silentest? This’s wel, _madame_!

    WIT. And while she were with puppy?

           PVG. Walke her out,
    And ayre her euery morning!

                  WIT. Very good!
    And be industrious to kill her fleas?                          240

    PVG. Yes!

                WIT. He will make a pretty proficient.

                                             PVG. Who,
    Comming from _Hell_, could looke for such Catechising?
    The _Diuell_ is an _Asse_. I doe acknowledge it.

    FIT. The top of woman! All her sexe in abstract!
                                Fitz-dottrel _admires_ Wittipol.
    I loue her, to each syllable, falls from her.                  245

    TAI. Good _madame_ giue me leaue to goe aside with him!
    And try him a little!

              WIT. Do, and I’ll with-draw, _Madame_,
    VVith this faire _Lady_: read to her, the while.

    TAI. Come, S^r.

         PVG. Deare _Chiefe_, relieue me, or I perish.

                                  _The_ Diuel _praies again_.

    WIT. _Lady_, we’ll follow. You are not iealous Sir?            250

    FIT. O, _madame_! you shall see. Stay wife, behold,
    I giue her vp heere, absolutely, to you,
    She is your owne. Do with her what you will!
                _He giues his wife to him, taking him to be a_ Lady.
    Melt, cast, and forme her as you shall thinke good!
    Set any stamp on! I’ll receiue her from you                    255
    As a new thing, by your owne standard!

         VVIT. Well, Sir!

    FIT. O, it goes on, I met your Cousin, the _Master_--

    MER. You did not acquaint him, S^r?

                    FIT. Faith, but I did, S^r.
    And vpon better thought, not without reason!
    He being chiefe _Officer_, might ha’ tane it ill, else,          5
    As a _Contempt_ against his Place, and that
    In time Sir, ha’ drawne on another _Dependance_.
    No, I did finde him in good termes, and ready
    To doe me any seruice.

        MER. So he said, to you?
    But S^r, you do not know him.

                                  FIT. VVhy, I presum’d             10
    Because this _bus’nesse_ of my wiues, requir’d mee,
    I could not ha’ done better: And hee told
    Me, that he would goe presently to your _Councell_,
    A Knight, here, i’ the Lane--

    But Sir, you meane not to make him _Feoffee_?

    PIT. Your Cousin Master _Euer-ill_, would come in--
    But he would know if Master _Manly_ were heere.                 20

    MER. No, tell him, if he were, I ha’ made his peace!
                                 Mere-craft _whispers against him_.
    Hee’s one, Sir, has no State, and a man knowes not,
    How such a trust may tempt him.

    EVE. S^r. this same deed is done here.

    Sir _Paul Eitherside_ will’d mee gi’ you caution,
    Whom you did make _Feoffee_: for ’tis the trust
    O’ your whole State: and though my Cousin heere                 30
    Be a worthy Gentleman, yet his valour has
    At the tall board bin question’d: and we hold
    Any man so impeach’d, of doubtfull honesty!
    I will not iustisie this; but giue it you
    To make your profit of it: if you vtter it,                     35
    I can forsweare it!

    Be not afraid, sweet _Lady_: yo’ are trusted           [154]
    To loue, not violence here; I am no rauisher,
    But one, whom you, by your faire trust againe,
    May of a seruant make a most true friend.

    M^rs. FI. And such a one I need, but not this way:               5
    Sir, I confesse me to you, the meere manner
    Of your attempting mee, this morning tooke mee,
    And I did hold m’inuention, and my manners,
    Were both engag’d, to giue it a requitall;
    But not vnto your ends: my hope was then,                       10
    (Though interrupted, ere it could be vtter’d)
    That whom I found the Master of such language,
    That braine and spirit, for such an enterprise,
    Could not, but if those succours were demanded
    To a right vse, employ them vertuously!                         15
    And make that profit of his noble parts,
    Which they would yeeld. S^r, you haue now the ground,
    To exercise them in: I am a woman:
    That cannot speake more wretchednesse of my selfe,
    Then you can read; match’d to a masse of folly;                 20
    That euery day makes haste to his owne ruine;
    The wealthy portion, that I brought him, spent;
    And (through my friends neglect) no ioynture made me.
    My fortunes standing in this precipice,
    ’Tis _Counsell_ that I want, and honest aides:                  25
    And in this name, I need you, for a friend!
    Neuer in any other; for his ill,
    Must not make me, S^r, worse.

               Manly, _conceal’d this while, shews himself_.

                 MAN. O friend! forsake not
    The braue occasion, vertue offers you,
    To keepe you innocent: I haue fear’d for both;                  30
    And watch’d you, to preuent the ill I fear’d.
    But, since the weaker side hath so assur’d mee,
    Let not the stronger fall by his owne vice,
    Or be the lesse a friend, cause vertue needs him.

    WIT. Vertue shall neuer aske my succours twice;                 35
    Most friend, most man: your _Counsells_ are commands:
    Lady, I can loue _goodnes_ in you, more                  [155]
    Then I did _Beauty_; and doe here intitle
    Your vertue, to the power, vpon a life
    You shall engage in any fruitfull seruice,                      40
    Euen to forfeit.

         MER. _Madame_: Do you heare, Sir,
                        Mere-craft _takes_ Wittipol _aside,_
                         & _moues a proiect for himselfe_.
    We haue another leg-strain’d, for this _Dottrel_.
    He’ha’s a quarrell to carry, and ha’s caus’d
    A deed of _Feoffment_, of his whole estate
    To be drawne yonder; h’ha’st within: And you,                   45
    Onely, he meanes to make _Feoffee_. H’is falne
    So desperatly enamour’d on you, and talkes
    Most like a mad-man: you did neuer heare
    A _Phrentick_, so in loue with his owne fauour!
    Now, you doe know, ’tis of no validity                          50
    In your name, as you stand; Therefore aduise him
    To put in me. (h’is come here:) You shall share Sir.

    FIT. _Madame_, I haue a suit to you; and afore-hand,
    I doe bespeake you; you must not deny me,
    I will be graunted.

                WIT. Sir, I must know it, though.

    FIT. No _Lady_; you must not know it: yet, you must too.
    For the trust of it, and the fame indeed,                        5
    Which else were lost me. I would vfe your name,
    But in a _Feoffment_: make my whole estate
    Ouer vnto you: a trifle, a thing of nothing,
    Some eighteene hundred.

                  WIT. Alas! I vnderstand not
    Those things Sir. I am a woman, and most loath,                 10
    To embarque my selfe--

                  FIT. You will not slight me, _Madame_?

    WIT. Nor you’ll not quarrell me?

            FIT. No, sweet _Madame_, I haue
    Already a _dependance_; for which cause
    I doe this: let me put you in, deare _Madame_,
    I may be fairely kill’d.

    WIT. You haue your friends, Sir,                                15
    About you here, for choice.

              EVE. She tells you right, Sir.

                             _Hee hopes to be the man._

    FIT. Death, if she doe, what do I care for that?
    Say, I would haue her tell me wrong.

    If for the trust, you’ll let me haue the honor
    To name you one.

    FIT. Nay, you do me the honor, _Madame_:                        20
    Who is’t?

         WIT. This Gentleman:

                               _Shee designes_ Manly.

                  FIT. O, no, sweet _Madame_,
    H’is friend to him, with whom I ha’ the _dependance_.

    WIT. Who might he bee?

             FIT. One _Wittipol_: do you know him?

    WIT. Alas Sir, he, a toy: This Gentleman
    A friend to him? no more then I am Sir!                         25

    FIT. But will your _Ladyship_ vndertake that, _Madame_?

    WIT. Yes, and what else, for him, you will engage me.

    FIT. What is his name?

            VVIT. His name is _Eustace Manly_.

    FIT. VVhence do’s he write himselfe?

            VVIT. of _Middle-sex_, _Esquire_.

    FIT. Say nothing, _Madame_. _Clerke_, come hether               30
    VVrite _Eustace Manly_, Squire o’ _Middle-sex_.

    MER. What ha’ you done, Sir?

                      VVIT. Nam’d a gentleman,
    That I’ll be answerable for, to you, Sir.
    Had I nam’d you, it might ha’ beene suspected:
    This way, ’tis safe.

    FIT. Come Gentlemen, your hands,                                35
    For witnes.

         MAN. VVhat is this?

    Of a most worthy _Gentleman_!

               MAN. VVould one of worth
    Had spoke it: whence it comes, it is
    Rather a shame to me, then a praise.

    EVE. Sir, I will giue you any Satisfaction.                     40

    MAN. Be silent then: “falshood commends not truth”.

    PLV. You do deliuer this, Sir, as your deed.
    To th’ vse of M^r. _Manly_?

                             FIT. Yes: and Sir--
    VVhen did you see yong _Wittipol_? I am ready,
    For processe now; Sir, this is _Publication_.                   45
    He shall heare from me, he would needes be courting
    My wife, Sir.

               MAN. Yes: So witnesseth his Cloake there.

    FIT. Nay good Sir,--_Madame_, you did vndertake--

                   Fitz-dottrel _is suspicious of_ Manly _still_.

    VVIT. VVhat?

          FIT. That he was not _Wittipols_ friend.

               VVIT. I heare S^r. no confession of it.

                            FIT. O she know’s not;                  50
    Now I remember, _Madame_! This young _Wittipol_,
    VVould ha’ debauch’d my wife, and made me _Cuckold_,
    Through a casement; he did fly her home
    To mine owne window: but I think I sou’t him,
    And rauifh’d her away, out of his pownces. 55
    I ha’ sworne to ha’ him by the eares: I feare
    The toy, wi’ not do me right.

                         VVIT. No? that were pitty!
    VVhat right doe you aske, Sir? Here he is will do’t you?

                                   Wittipol _discouers himselfe_.

    FIT. Ha? _Wittipol_?

    VVIT. I Sir, no more _Lady_ now,
    Nor _Spaniard_!

             MAN. No indeed, ’tis _Wittipol_.                       60

    FIT. Am I the thing I fear’d?

           VVIT. A _Cuckold_? No Sir,
    But you were late in possibility,
    I’ll tell you so much.

           MAN. But your wife’s too vertuous!

    VVIT. VVee’ll see her Sir, at home, and leaue you here,
    To be made _Duke o’ Shore-ditch_ with a proiect.        [157]   65

    FIT. Theeues, rauishers.

    VVIT. Crie but another note, Sir,
    I’ll marre the tune, o’ your pipe!

              FIT. Gi’ me my deed, then.

                             _He would haue his_ deed _again_.

    VVIT. Neither: that shall be kept for your wiues good,
    VVho will know, better how to vse it.

                   FIT. Ha’
    To feast you with my land?

                 VVIT. Sir, be you quiet,                           70
    Or I shall gag you, ere I goe, consult
    Your Master of dependances; how to make this
    A second businesse, you haue time Sir.

                      VVitipol _bafflees him, and goes out_.

                                 FIT. Oh!
    VVhat will the ghost of my wise Grandfather,
    My learned _Father_, with my worshipfull _Mother_,              75
    Thinke of me now, that left me in this world
    In state to be their _Heire_? that am become
    A _Cuckold_, and an _Asse_, and my wiues Ward;
    Likely to loose my land; ha’ my throat cut:
    All, by her practice!

                    MER. Sir, we are all abus’d!                    80

    FIT. And be so still! VVho hinders you, I pray you,
    Let me alone, I would enioy my selfe,
    And be the _Duke o’ Drown’d-Land_, you ha’ made me.

    MER. Sir, we must play an _after-game_ o’ this.

    FIT. But I am not in case to be a _Gam-ster_:                   85
    I tell you once againe--

    MER. You must be rul’d
    And take some counsell.

            FIT. Sir, I do hate counsell,
    As I do hate my wife, my wicked wife!

    MER. But we may thinke how to recouer all:
    If you will act.

           FIT. I will not think; nor act;                          90
    Nor yet recouer; do not talke to me?
    I’ll runne out o’ my witts, rather then heare;
    I will be what I am, _Fabian Fitz-Dottrel_,

    And then she would ha’ had you, to ha’ sampled you

    And do’s pretend to your ranck.

                                        Pitfall _goes out_.
    This most vnlucky accident will goe neare

    I would beseech your worship stand betweene                     10
    Me, and my _Ladies_ displeasure, for my absence.

    MER. O, is that all? I warrant you.

    AMB. I would tell you Sir
    But how it happened.

                 MER. Brief, good Master _Ambler_,
    Put your selfe to your rack: for I haue tasque
    Of more importance.
                         Mere-craft _seemes full of businesse_.

                 AMB. Sir you’ll laugh at me?                       15
    But (so is _Truth_) a very friend of mine,
    Finding by conference with me, that I liu’d
    Too chast for my complexion (and indeed
    Too honest for my place, Sir) did aduise me
    If I did loue my selfe (as that I do,                           20
    I must confesse)

               MER. Spare your _Parenthesis_.

    MER. Well, and you went to a whore?

                         AMB. No, S^r. I durst not
    (For feare it might arriue at some body’s eare,
    It should not) trust my selfe to a common house;                25
                    Ambler _tels this with extraordinary speed_.
    But got the Gentlewoman to goe with me,
    And carry her bedding to a _Conduit-head_,
    Hard by the place toward _Tyborne_, which they call
    My L. Majors _Banqueting-house_. Now Sir, This morning
    Was _Execution_; and I ner’e dream’t on’t 30
    Till I heard the noise o’ the people, and the horses;
    And neither I, nor the poore Gentlewoman                 [159]
    Durst stirre, till all was done and past: so that
    I’ the _Interim_, we fell a sleepe againe.

                                            _He flags_.

    MER. Nay, if you fall, from your gallop, I am gone S^r.         35

    AMB. But, when I wak’d, to put on my cloathes, a sute,
    I made new for the action, it was gone,
    And all my money, with my purse, my seales,
    My hard-wax, and my table-bookes, my studies,
    And a fine new deuise, I had to carry                           40
    My pen, and inke, my ciuet, and my tooth-picks,
    All vnder one. But, that which greiu’d me, was
    The Gentlewoman’s shoes (with a paire of roses,
    And garters, I had giuen her for the businesse)
    So as that made vs stay, till it was darke.                     45
    For I was faine to lend her mine, and walke
    In a rug, by her, barefoote, to Saint _Giles’es_.

    MER. A kind of Irish penance! Is this all, Sir?

    AMB. To satisfie my _Lady_.

                     MER. I will promise you, S^r.

    AMB. I ha’ told the true _Disaster_.

                     MER. I cannot stay wi’ you                     50
    Sir, to condole; but gratulate your returne.

    Catching the windes together in a net,

    Out leap’d the other, then endure a minute

    Ha! This is hee, I tooke a sleepe with his _Wench_,

    About these clothes.

    Or do not I speake to him, what I meane?
    Good Sir your name.

    Not _Compos mentis_, when you made your _feoffment_.
    There’s no recouery o’ your state, but this:
    This, Sir, will sting.

    These gallants in these shapes.

             EVE. T’haue don strange things, Sir.
    One as the _Lady_, the other as the _Squire_.

    MER. How, a mans honesty may be fool’d! I thought him           20
    A very _Lady_.

              FIT. So did I: renounce me else.

    MER. But this way, Sir, you’ll be reueng’d at height.

    Has runne the way of woman thus, e’en giue her--

    I charge you gentlemen.

         FIT. Arrest me? Why?

    GVI. For better security, Sir. My sonne _Plutarchus_             5
    Assures me, y’are not worth a groat.

                        PLV. Pardon me, _Father_,

    And that I’ll iustifie, for I writ the deed.

    Thou art not mad, though th’art _Constable_
    Puft vp with th’ pride of the place? Do you heare, Sirs.
    Haue I deseru’d this from you two? for all                      15

                                    _The_ Project _of forks_.

                MER. The laudable vse of forkes,
    Brought into custome here, as they are in _Italy_,
    To th’ sparing o’ _Napkins_. That, that should haue made        20
    Your bellowes goe at the forge, as his at the fornace.
    I ha’ procur’d it, ha’ the Signet for it,
    Dealt with the _Linnen-drapers_, on my priuate,
    By cause, I fear’d, they were the likelyest euer
    To stirre against, to crosse it; for ’twill be                  25
    A mighty sauer of _Linnen_ through the kingdome
    (As that is one o’ my grounds, and to spare washing)
    Now, on you two, had I layd all the profits.
    _Guilt-head_ to haue the making of all those
    Of gold and siluer, for the better personages;                  30
    And you, of those of _Steele_ for the common sort.
    And both by _Pattent_, I had brought you your seales in.
    But now you haue preuented me, and I thanke you.

                                       Sledge _is brought about_.

                              _And_ Guilt-head _comes_.

    GVI. I like the fashion o’ the proiect, well,
    The forkes! It may be a lucky one! and is not
    Intricate, as one would say, but fit for
    Plaine heads, as ours, to deale in. Do you heare
    _Officers_, we discharge you.

                       MER. Why this shewes                         40
    A little good nature in you, I confesse,
    But do not tempt your friends thus. Little _Guilt-head_,
    Aduise your sire, great _Guilt-head_ from these courses:
    And, here, to trouble a great man in reuersion,
    For a matter o’ fifty on a false _Alarme_,                      45

AMBLER.  {_To them._

    O Master _Sledge_, are you here? I ha’ been to seeke you.
    You are the _Constable_, they say. Here’s one
    That I do charge with _Felony_, for the suite
    He weares, Sir.

    MER. Who? M. _Fitz-Dottrels_ man?
    Ware what you do, M. _Ambler_.

    I’ll sweare, are mine: and the shooes the gentlewomans
    I told you of: and ha’ him afore a _Iustice_,             [163]
    I will.

         PVG. My master, Sir, will passe his word for me.

    AMB. O, can you speake to purpose now?

                                   FIT. Not I,
    If you be such a one Sir, I will leaue you                      10
    To your _God fathers_ in Law. Let twelue men worke.

    PVG. Do you heare Sir, pray, in priuate.

               FIT. well, what say you?
    Briefe, for I haue no time to loose.

                      PVG. Truth is, Sir,
    I am the very _Diuell_, and had leaue
    To take this body, I am in, to serue you;                       15
    Which was a _Cutpurses_, and hang’d this Morning.
    And it is likewise true, I stole this suite
    To cloth me with. But Sir let me not goe
    To prison for it. I haue hitherto
    Lost time, done nothing; showne, indeed, no part                20
    O’ my _Diuels_ nature. Now, I will so helpe
    Your malice, ’gainst these parties; so aduance
    The businesse, that you haue in hand of _witchcraft_,
    And your _possession_, as my selfe were in you.
    Teach you such tricks, to make your belly swell,                25
    And your eyes turne, to foame, to stare, to gnash
    Your teeth together, and to beate your selfe,
    Laugh loud, and faine six voices--

                              FIT. Out you Rogue!
    You most infernall counterfeit wretch! Auant!
    Do you thinke to gull me with your _Æsops Fables_?              30
    Here take him to you, I ha’ no part in him.

              PVG. Sir.

    FIT. Away, I do disclaime, I will not heare you.

                                     _And sends him away._

    MER. What said he to you, Sir?

    FIT. Like a lying raskall
    Told me he was the _Diuel_.

              MER. How! a good iest!

    FIT. And that he would teach me, such fine _diuels_ tricks      35
    For our new resolution.

                                   EVE. O’ pox on him,
    ’Twas excellent wisely done, Sir, not to trust him.

              Mere-craft _giues the instructions to him and the rest_.

    MER. Why, if he were the Diuel, we sha’ not need him,
    If you’ll be rul’d. Goe throw your selfe on a bed, Sir,
    And faine you ill. Wee’ll not be seene wi’ you,                 40
    Till after, that you haue a fit: and all
    Confirm’d within. Keepe you with the two _Ladies_
    And perswade them. I’ll to _Iustice Either-side_,

    And they two fill the towne with’t, euery cable                 45
    Is to be veer’d. We must employ out all
    Our _emissaries_ now; Sir, I will send you
    _Bladders_ and _Bellowes_. Sir, be confident,
    ’Tis no hard thing t’out doe the _Deuill_ in:
    A Boy o’ thirteene yeere old made him an _Asse_                 50
    But t’toher day.

            FIT. Well, I’ll beginne to practice;
    And scape the imputation of being _Cuckold_,
    By mine owne act.

               MER. yo’ are right.

                                 EVE. Come, you ha’ put
    Your selfe to a simple coyle here, and your freinds,     [164]
    By dealing with new _Agents_, in new plots.                     55

    MER. No more o’ that, sweet cousin.

                               EVE. What had you
    To doe with this same _Wittipol_, for a _Lady_?

    MER. Question not that: ’tis done.

    EVE. You had some straine
    ’Boue E-_la_?

         MER. I had indeed.

             EVE. And, now, you crack for’t.

    MER. Do not vpbraid me.

         EVE. Come, you must be told on’t;                          60
    You are so couetous, still, to embrace
    More then you can, that you loose all.

                                         MER. ’Tis right.

    Here you are lodg’d, Sir, you must send your garnish,

    To _New-gate_, brought? How is the name of _Deuill_
    Discredited in me! What a lost fiend
    Shall I be, on returne? My _Cheife_ will roare                  5

    That body back here, was hang’d out this morning.
    Well! would it once were midnight, that I knew

    Cast care at thy posternes; and firke i’ thy fetters,           15
    They are ornaments, _Baby_, haue graced thy betters:
    Looke vpon me, and hearken. Our _Cheife_ doth salute thee,
    And least the coldyron should chance to confute thee,

    That so thou mayest haue a triumphall egression.

    PVG. In a cart, to be hang’d.

                       ING. No, _Child_, in a Carre,
    The charriot of Triumph, which most of them are.
    And in the meane time, to be greazy, and bouzy,                 25
    And nasty, and filthy, and ragged and louzy,
    With dam’n me, renounce me, and all the fine phrases;
    That bring, vnto _Tiborne_, the plentifull gazes.

    PVG. He is a _Diuell_! and may be our _Cheife_!          [165]
    The great Superiour _Diuell_! for his malice:                   30

    What I would suffer, when he tie’d me vp thus
    In a rogues body: and he has (I thanke him)
    His tyrannous pleasure on me, to confine me
    To the vnlucky carkasse of a _Cutpurse_,                        35
    wherein I could do nothing.

                         _The great_ Deuill _enters, and vpbraids
                              him with all his dayes worke_.

                           DIV. Impudent fiend,
    Stop thy lewd mouth. Doest thou not shame and tremble
    To lay thine owne dull damn’d defects vpon
    An innocent case, there? Why thou heauy slaue!
    The spirit, that did possesse that flesh before                 40
    Put more true life, in a finger, and a thumbe,
    Then thou in the whole Masse. Yet thou rebell’st
    And murmur’st? What one profer hast thou made,
    Wicked inough, this day, that might be call’d
    Worthy thine owne, much lesse the name that sent thee?          45
    First, thou did’st helpe thy selfe into a beating
    Promptly, and with’t endangered’st too thy tongue:
    A _Diuell_, and could not keepe a body intire
    One day! That, for our credit. And to vindicate it,
    Hinderd’st (for ought thou know’st) a deed of darknesse:        50
    Which was an act of that egregious folly,
    As no one, to’ard the _Diuel_, could ha’ thought on.
    This for your acting! but for suffering! why
    Thou hast beene cheated on, with a false beard,
    And a turn’d cloake. Faith, would your predecessour             55
    The _Cutpurse_, thinke you, ha’ been so? Out vpon thee,
    The hurt th’ hast don, to let men know their strength,
    And that the’are able to out-doe a _diuel_
    Put in a body, will for euer be
    A scarre vpon our Name! whom hast thou dealt with,              60
    Woman or man, this day, but haue out-gone thee
    Some way, and most haue prou’d the better fiendes?
    Yet, you would be imploy’d? Yes, hell shall make you

    For this side o’ the towne! No doubt you’ll render              65

    And scratching for imployment. I’ll ha’ brimstone
    To allay it sure, and fire to sindge your nayles off,

    Sticke on our state, as that the _diuell_ were hang’d;          70
    And could not saue a body, that he tooke
    From _Tyborne_, but it must come thither againe:
    You should e’en ride. But, vp away with him--

                                   _The Iustice interpret all:_

    MER. Do you thinke so, S^r.

              POV. I discharge my conscience.                       30

    FIT. _And is not the Diuell good company? Yes, wis._

    EVE. How he changes, Sir, his voyce!

                           FIT. _And a Cuckold is
    Where ere hee put his head, with a_ a _Wanion,
    If his hornes be forth, the Diuells companion!
    Looke, looke, looke, else._

         MER. How he foames!

              EVE. And swells!                                      35

    TAY. O, me! what’s that there, rises in his belly!

    EIT. A strange thing! hold it downe:

              TRA. PIT. We cannot, _Madam_.

    POV. ’Tis too apparent this!

              FIT. _Wittipol, Wittipol._

              Wittipol, _and_ Manly _and_ Mistr. Fitz-dottrel _enter_.

    WIT. How now, what play ha’ we here.

              MAN. What fine, new matters?

    WIT. The _Cockscomb_, and the _Couerlet_.

                        MER. O strang impudēce!                     40
    That these should come to face their sinne!

                      EVE. And out-face
    _Iustice_, they are the parties, Sir.

                             POV. Say nothing.

    MER. Did you marke, Sir, vpon their comming in,
    How he call’d _Wittipol_.

                      EVE. And neuer saw ’hem.

    POV. I warrant you did I, let ’hem play a while.                45

    FIT. _Buz, buz, buz, buz._

    TAY. Lasse poore Gentleman!

    M^rs. FI. Fie, Master _Fitz-dottrel_!
    What doe you meane to counterfait thus?

                                 FIT. _O, ô,_
                                         _His wife goes to him._
    _Shee comes with a needle, and thrusts it in,_
    _Shee pulls out that, and shee puts in a pinne,_                50
    _And now, and now, I doe not know how, nor where,_
    _But shee pricks mee heere, and shee pricks me there: ôh, ôh:_

    POV. Woman forbeare.

              WIT. What, S^r?

      POV. A practice foule
    For one so faire:

              WIT. Hath this, then, credit with you?

    MAN. Do you beleeue in’t?

             POV. Gentlemen, I’ll discharge
    My conscience. ’Tis a cleare conspiracy!                        56
    A darke, and diuellish practice! I detest it!

    WIT. The _Iustice_ sure will proue the merrier man!        [168]

    MAN. This is most strange, Sir!

              POV. Come not to confront
    Authority with impudence: I tell you,
    I doe detest it. Here comes the Kings _Constable_,
    And with him a right worshipfull _Commoner_;
    My good friend, Master _Guilt-head_! I am glad
    I can before such witnesses, professe
    My conscience, and my detestation of it.                        65
    Horible! most vnaturall! Abominable!

    EVE. You doe not tumble enough.

              MER. Wallow, gnash:

                                  _They whisper him._

    TAY. O, how he is vexed!

              POV. ’Tis too manifest.

    EVE. Giue him more soap to foame with, now lie still.

                     _and giue him soape to act with._

    MER. And act a little.

                   TAY. What do’s he now, S^r.

                                        POV. Shew
    The taking of _Tabacco_, with which the _Diuell_
    Is so delighted.

              FIT. _Hum!_

                        POV. And calls for _Hum_.
    You takers of strong _Waters_, and _Tabacco_,
    Marke this.

              FIT. _Yellow, yellow, yellow, yellow_, &c.

    POV. That’s _Starch_! the _Diuells_ Idoll of that colour.       75
    He ratifies it, with clapping of his hands.
    The proofes are pregnant.

              GVI. How the _Diuel_ can act!

    POV. He is the Master of _Players_! Master _Guilt-head_,
    And _Poets_, too! you heard him talke in rime!
    I had forgot to obserue it to you, ere while!                   80

    TAY. See, he spits fire.

                 POV. O no, he plaies at _Figgum_,
    The _Diuell_ is the Author of wicked _Figgum_--

               _Sir_ Poule _interprets_ Figgum _to be a Iuglers game_.

    MAN. Why speake you not vnto him?

                            WIT. If I had
    All innocence of man to be indanger’d,
    And he could saue, or ruine it: I’ld not breath                 85
    A syllable in request, to such a foole,
    He makes himselfe.

    FIT. _O they whisper, whisper, whisper.
    Wee shall haue more, of Diuells a score,
    To come to dinner, in mee the sinner._

    EYT. Alas, poore Gentleman!

           POV. Put ’hem asunder.                                   90
    Keepe ’hem one from the other.

                   MAN. Are you phrenticke, Sir,
    Or what graue dotage moues you, to take part
    VVith so much villany? wee are not afraid
    Either of law, or triall; let vs be
    Examin’d what our ends were, what the meanes?                   95
    To worke by, and possibility of those meanes.
    Doe not conclude against vs, ere you heare vs.

    POV. I will not heare you, yet I will conclude
    Out of the circumstances.

                   MAN. VVill you so, Sir?

    POV. Yes, they are palpable:

                   MAN. Not as your folly:                         100

    POV. I will discharge my conscience, and doe all
    To the _Meridian_ of Iustice:

                   GVI. You doe well, Sir.

    FIT. _Prouide mee to eat, three or foure dishes o’ good meat,
    I’ll feast them, and their traines, a Iustice head and braines
    Shall be the first._

         POV. The _Diuell_ loues not Iustice,                [169]
    There you may see.

                      FIT. _A spare-rib O’ my wife,                106
    And a whores purt’nance! a_ Guilt-head _whole_.

    POV. Be not you troubled, Sir, the _Diuell_ speakes it.

    FIT. _Yes, wis, Knight, shite, Poule, Ioule, owle, foule,
            troule, boule._

    POV. _Crambe_, another of the _Diuell’s_ games!                110

    MER. Speake. Sir, some _Greeke_, if you can. Is not the _Iustice_
    A solemne gamester?

         EVE. Peace.

                     FIT. Οὶ μοὶ, κακοδαιμων,
    Καὶ τρισκακοδαίμων, καὶ τετράκις, καὶ πεντάκις,
    Καὶ δοδεκάκις, καὶ μυριάκις.

          POV. Hee curses.
    In _Greeke_, I thinke.

              EVE. Your _Spanish_, that I taught you.              115

    FIT. _Quebrémos el ojo de burlas_,

                                EVE. How? your rest--
    Let’s breake his necke in iest, the _Diuell_ saies.

    FIT. _Di grátia, Signòr mio se haúete denári fataméne parte._

    MER. What, would the _Diuell_ borrow money?

                                     FIT. _Ouy,
    Ouy Monsieur, ùn pàuure Diable! Diablet in!_                   120

    POV. It is the _diuell_, by his seuerall langauges.

                             _Enter the_ Keeper _of_ New-gate.

    SHA. Where’s S^r. _Poule Ether-side_?

              POV. Here, what’s the matter?

    SHA. O! such an accident falne out at _Newgate_, Sir:
    A great piece of the prison is rent downe!
    The _Diuell_ has beene there, Sir, in the body--               125
    Of the young _Cut-Purse_, was hang’d out this morning,
    But, in new clothes, Sir, euery one of vs know him.
    These things were found in his pocket.

              AMB. Those are mine, S^r.

    SHA. I thinke he was commited on your charge, Sir.
    For a new felony.

              AMB. Yes.

                      SHA. Hee’s gone, Sir, now,                   130
    And left vs the dead body. But withall, Sir,
    Such an infernall stincke, and steame behinde,
    You cannot see S^t. _Pulchars Steeple_, yet.
    They smell’t as farre as _Ware_, as the wind lies,             134
    By this time, sure.

              FIT. Is this vpon your credit, friend?

                         Fitz-dottrel _leaues counterfaiting_.

    SHA. Sir, you may see, and satisfie your selfe.

    FIT. Nay, then, ’tis time to leaue off counterfeiting.
    Sir I am not bewitch’d, nor haue a _Diuell_:
    No more then you. I doe defie him, I,
    And did abuse you. These two Gentlemen                         140
    Put me vpon it. (I haue faith against him)
    They taught me all my tricks. I will tell truth,
    And shame the _Feind_. See, here, Sir, are my bellowes,
    And my false belly, and my _Mouse_, and all
    That should ha’ come forth?

          MAN. Sir, are not you asham’d
    Now of your solemne, serious vanity?                           146

    POV. I will make honorable amends to truth.

    FIT. And so will I. But these are _Coozeners_, still;
    And ha’ my land, as plotters, with my wife:
    Who, though she be not a witch, is worse, a whore.             150

    MAN. Sir, you belie her. She is chaste, and vertuous,
    And we are honest. I doe know no glory                    [170]
    A man should hope, by venting his owne follyes,
    But you’ll still be an _Asse_, in spight of prouidence.
    Please you goe in, Sir, and heare truths, then iudge ’hem:
    And make amends for your late rashnesse; when,                 156
    You shall but heare the paines and care was taken,
    To saue this foole from ruine (his _Grace_ of _Drown’d-land_)

    FIT. My land is drown’d indeed--

              POV. Peace.

                                MAN. And how much
    His modest, and too worthy wife hath suffer’d                  160
    By mis-construction, from him, you will blush,
    First, for your owne beliefe, more for his actions!
    His land is his: and neuer, by my friend,
    Or by my selfe, meant to another vse,
    But for her succours, who hath equall right.                   165
    If any other had worse counsells in’t,
    (I know I speake to those can apprehend mee)
    Let ’hem repent ’hem, and be not detected.
    It is not manly to take ioy, or pride
    In humane errours. (wee doe all ill things,                    170
    They doe ’hem worst that loue ’hem, and dwell there,
    Till the plague comes) The few that haue the seeds
    Of goodnesse left, will sooner make their way
    To a true life, by shame, then punishment.

                      _THE END_.
