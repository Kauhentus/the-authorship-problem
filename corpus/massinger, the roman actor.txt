To his deare Friend the Author.

I Am no great admirer of the Playes,
Poets, or Actors, that are now adayes:
Yet in this Worke of thine me thinkes I see
Sufficient reason for Idolatrie.
Each line thou hast taught CEASAR is, as high
As Hee could speake, when groueling Flatterie,
And His owne pride (forgetting Heavens rod)
By His Edicts stil'd himselfe great Lord and God.
By thee againe the Lawrell crownes His Head;
And thus reviu'd, who can affirme him dead?
Such power lyes in this loftie straine as can
Giue Swords, and legions to DOMITIAN.
And when thy PARIS pleades in the defence
Of Actors, every grace, and excellence
Of Argument for that subject, are by Thee
Contracted in a sweete Epitome.
Nor doe thy Women the tyr'd Hearers vexe,
With language no way proper to their sexe.
Iust like a cunning Painter thou lets fall
Copies more faire then the Originall.
I'll adde but this. From all the moderne Playes
The Stage hath lately borne, this winnes the Bayes.
And if it come to tryall boldly looke
To carrie it cleere, Thy witnesse being thy Booke.

In Philippi Massingeri, Poetae elegantiss: Actorem Romanum, typis excusum.[...]

ECce Philippinae, celebrata Tragaedia Musae
Quam Roscus Britonum Roscius egit, adest.
Semper, fronde ambo vireant Parnasside, semper
Liber ab invidrae dentibus esto, Liber.
Crebra papyriuori spernas incendia paeti
Thus, Vaenum expositi tegmina suta libri:
Nec metuas raucos, Momorum Sybila, rhencos
Tam bardus nebulo si tamen vllus, erit.

To his deseruing Friend Mr. Philip Massinger, vpon his Tragaedie, the Roman Actor.

PARIS, the best of Actors in his age
Acts yet, and speakes vpon our Roman Stage
Such lines by thee, as doe not derogate
From Romes proud heights, and Her then learned State.
Nor great Domitians fauour; not th'embraces
Of a faire Empresse, nor those often graces
Which from th'applauding Theaters were pay'd
To His braue Action, nor His ashes layd
In the Flaminian way, where people strow'd
His Graue with flowers, and Martialls wit bestow'd
A lasting Epitaph, not all these same
Doe adde so much renowne to Paris name,
As this that thou present'st his Historie
So well to vs. For which in thankes would Hee
(If that His soule, as thought Pithagoras
Could into any of our Actors passe)
Life to these Lines by action gladly giue
Whose Pen so well has made His storie liue.
Tho: May.

Vpon Mr. MASSINGER His Roman Actor.

TO write, is growne so common in our Time
That euery one, who can but frame a Rime
Howeuer monstrous, giues Himselfe that praise
Which onely Hee should claime, that may weare Bayes
By their Applause whose judgements apprehend
The weight, and truth, of what they dare commend.
In this besotted Age (friend) 'tis thy glory
That Heere thou hast out-done the Roman story.
Domitians pride; His wiues lust vnabated
In death; with Paris, meerly were related
Without a Soule, Vntill thy abler Pen
Spoke them, and made them speake, nay Act agen
In such a height, that Heere to know their Deeds
Hee may become an Actor that but Reades.
Iohn Foorde.

LOng'st thou to see proud Caesar set in State,
His Morning greatnesse, or his Euening fate?
With admiration heere behold him fall
And yet out-liue his tragique Funerall:
For 'tis a question whether Caesars Glorie
Rose to its heighth before, or in this Storie.
Or whether Paris in Domitians fauour
Were more exalted, then in this thy labour.
Each line speakes him an Emperour, eu'ry phrase
Crownes thy deseruing temples with the Bayes;
So that reciprocally both agree
Thou liu'st in him and Hee surviues in Thee.
Robert Harvey.

To His long knowne and lou'd Friend, Mr. PHILIP MASSINGER, vpon His Roman Actor.

IF that my Lines being plac'd before thy Books
Could make it sell, or alter but a looke
Of some sowre Censurer, who's apt to say
No one in these Times can produce a Play
Worthy his reading, since of late, 'tis true
The old accepted are more then the new.
Or could I on some Spot o'the Court worke so
To make him speake no more then He doth know;
Not borrowing from His flattering flatter'd friend
What to dispraise, or wherefore to commend.
Then (gentle Friend) I should not blush to bee
Rank'd 'mongst those worthy ones, which heere I see
Vshering this Worke, but why I write to Thee
Is to professe our loues Antiquitie,
Which to this Tragaedie must giue my test,
Thou hast made many good, but this thy best.

THE ROMAN ACTOR, A Tragedie.


ACTVS, I. SCAENA, I.
Enter Paris, Latinus, AEsopus.

AEsop.
WHat doe wee acte to day?

Latinus.
Agaves phrensie
With Pentheus bloudie end.

Paris.
It skils not what
5
The times are dull, and all that wee receiue
Will hardly satisfie the dayes Expence.
The Greekes (to whom we owe the first inuention
Both of the buskind scaene and humble stocke)
That raigne in euery noble familie
10
Declaime against vs: and our Amphitheater.
Great Pompies worke, that hath giu'n full delight
Both to the eye, and eare of fifty thousand
Spectators in one day, as if it were
Some vnknowne desert, or great Roome vnpeopl'd,
15
Is quite forsaken.

Latin.
Pleasures of worse natures
Are gladly entertayn'd, and they that shun vs,
Practise in priuate sports the Stewes would blush at.
A Litter borne by eight Liburnian slaues,
20
To buy Diseases from a glorious strumpet,
The most censorious of our Roman gentrie,
Nay of the guarded robe the Senators,
Esteeme an easie purchase,

Paris
Yet grudge vs
25
(That with delight joyne profit and endeauour
To build their mindes vp faire, and on the Stage
Decipher to the life what honours waite
On good, and glorious actions, and the shame
That treads vpon the heeles of vice. The salarie
30
Of six Sestertij:

AEsop.
For the profit Paris,
And mercinarie gaine they are things beneath vs
Since while you hold your grace, and power with Caesar,
We from your bounty finde a large supply,
35
Nor can one thought of want euer approach vs,

Par.
Our aime is glorie, and to leaue our names
To after times.

Latin.
And would they giue vs leaue
There ends all our ambition.

AEsop.
40
Wee haue enemies
And great ones too, I feare. 'Tis giuen out lately
The Consull Aretinus (Caesars spie)
Sayd at his Table ere a moneth expir'd
(For being gald in our last Comedie)
45
He would silence vs for euer.

Par.
I expect
No fauour from him, my strong Auentine is
That great Domitian, whom we oft haue cheer'd
In his most sullen moodes will once returne,
50
Who can repayre with ease, the Consols ruines.

Lat.
'Tis frequent in the Citie, he hath subdued
The Catti, and the Daci, and ere long,
The second time will enter Rome in triumph.
Enter two Lictors.

Par.
Ioue hasten it, with vs? I now beleeue
55
The Consuls threates AEsopus.

1Lict.
You are summon'd
T'appeare to day in Senate.

2Lict.
And there to answer
What shall be vrg'd against you.

Par.
60
We obey you.
Nay droope not fellowes, innocence should be bould
We that haue personated in the Sceane
The ancient Heroes, and the falles of Princes
With loude applause, being to act our selues,
65
Must doe it with vndaunted confidence.
What ere our sentence be 'tis in sport.
And though condemn'd lets heare it without sorrow
As if we were to liue againe to morrow.

1Lict.
'Tis spoken like your selfe.
Enter AElius/ Lamia, Iun√Øus/ Rusticus, Palphuris/ Sura.

Lam.
70
Whether goes Paris?

1Lict.
He's cited to the Senate.

Lat.
I am glad the State is
So free from matters of more waight and trouble
That it has vacant time to looke on vs.

Par.
75
That reuerend place, in which the affaires of Kings.
And prouinces were determin'd, to descend
To the censure of a bitter word, or iest,
Drop'd from a Poets pen I peace to your Lordships
We are glad that you are safe.
Exeunt Lictors, Paris, Latinus, AEsopus.

Lam.
80
What times are these?
To what is Rome falne? may we being alone
Speake our thoughts freely of the Prince, and State,
And not feare the informer.

Rust.
Noble Lamia,
85
So dangerous the age is, and such bad acts
Are practis'd euery where, we hardly sleepe
Nay cannot dreame with safetie. All our actions
Are cal'd in question, to be nobly borne
Is now a crime; and to deserue too well
90
Held Capitall treason. Sonnes accuse their Fathers,
Fathers their sonnes; and but to winne a smile
From one in grace in Court, our chastest Matrons
Make shipwracke of their honours. To be vertuous
Is to bee guilty. They are onely safe
95
That know to sooth the Princes appetite,
And serue his lusts.

Sura.
Tis true; and tis my wonder
That two sonnes of so different a nature,
Should spring from good Vespatian. We had a Titus,
100
Stilde justly the delight of all mankinde,
Who did esteeme that day lost in his life
In which some one or other tasted not.
Of his magnificent bounties. One that had
A readie teare when he was forc'd to signe
105
The death of an offender. And so farre
From pride, that he disdain'd not the conuerse
Euen of the poorest Roman.

Lam.
Yet his brother
Domitian, that now swayes the power of things,
110
Is so inclin'd to bloud, that noe day passes
In which some are not fastend to the hooke,
Or throwne downe from the Gemonies. His freemen
Scorne the Nobilitie, and he himselfe
As if he were not made of flesh and bloud,
115
Forgets he is a man.

Rust.
In his young yeeres
He shew'd what he would be when growne to ripenes:
His greatest pleasure was being a childe
With a sharp pointed bodkin to kill flies,
120
Whose roomes now men supply. For his escape.
In the Vitellian warre he rais'd a Temple
To Iupiter, and proudly plac'd his figure
In the bosome of the God. And in his edicts
He does not blush, or start to stile himselfe
125
(As if the name of Emperour were base)
Great Lord, and God Domitian.

Sura.
I haue letters
He's on his way to Rome, and purposes
To enter with all glorie. The flattering Senate
130
Decrees him divine Honours, and to crosse it
Were death with studied torments; for my part
I will obey the time, it is in vaine
To striue against the torrent

Rust.
Lets to the Curia
135
And though vnwillingly grieue our suffrages
Before we are compeld.

Lam.
And since we cannot
With safetie vse the actiue, lets make vse of
The passiue fortitude, with this assurance
140
That the state sicke in him, the gods to friend,
Though at the worst will now begin to mend.
Exeunt.
ACTVS, I. SCAENA, 2.
Enter Domitia, and Parthenius.

Domit.
To me this reuerence?

Parth.
I pay it Ladie
As a debt due to her thats Caesars mistris.
145
For vnderstand with ioy he that commands
All that the Sunne giues warmth to, is your seruant.
Be not amaz'd, but fit you to your fortunes.
Thinke vpon state, and greatnesse, and the Honours
That waite vpon Augusta, for that name
150
Ere long comes to you: still you doubt your vassall,
But when you haue read this letter, writ, and sign'd
With his imperiall hand, you will be freed
From feare, and jealousie and I beseech you,
When all the beauties of the earth bowe to you,
155
And Senators shall take it for an honour,
As I doe now to kisse these happie feete;
When euery smile you giue is a preferment,
And you dispose of Prouinces to your creatures,
Thinke on Parthenius.

Domit.
160
Rise. I am transported,
And hardly dare beleeue what is assur'd here.
The meanes, my good Parthenius, that wrought Caesar
(Our God on earth) to cast an eye of fauour
Vpon his humble handmaide!

Parth.
165
What but your beautie?
When nature fram'd you for her master piece,
As the pure abstract of all rare in woman,
She had no other ends but to designe you
To the most eminent place. I will not say
170
(For it would smell of arrogance to insinuate
The seruice I haue done you) with what zeale
I oft haue made relation of your Vertues,
Or how I haue sung your goodnesse or how Caesar
Was fir'd with the relation of your stories
175
I am rewarded in the acte, and happie
In that my proiect prosper'd.

Domit.
You are modest,
And were it in my power I would to be thankefull.
If that when I was mistris of my selfe,
180
And in my way of youth, pure, and vntainted,
The Emperour had vouchsaf'd to seeke my fauours,
I had with ioy giuen vp my virgin fort
At the first summons to his soft embraces:
But I am now anothers, not mine owne.
185
You know I haue a husband, for my honour
I would not be his strumpet, and how lawe
Can bee dispenc'd with to become his wife.
To mee's a riddle.

Parth.
I can soone resolue it.
190
When power puts in his Plea the lawes are silenc'd,
The world confesses one Rome, and one Caesar,
And as his rules is infinite, his pleasures
Are vnconfin'd; this sillable his will
Stands for a thousand reasons,

Domit.
195
But with safetie,
Suppose I should consent, how can I doe it,
My husband is a Senator of a temper,
Not to be iested with.
Enter Lamia.

Parth.
As if hee durst
200
Be Caesars riuall. Heere he comes, with ease
I will remoue this scruple.

Lam.
How! so priuate!
Mine owne house made a brothell! Sir how durst you,
Though gaurded with your power in Court, and greatnesse,
205
Hould conference with my wife? as for your Minion
I shall hereafter treate.

Parth.
You are rude, and sawcie,
Nor know to whom you speake.

Lam.
This is fine i faith!

Parth.
210
Your wife? but touch her, that respect forgotten
That's due to her, whom mightiest Casar fauours
And thinke what 'tis to die. Not to loose time.
She's Caesars choice. It is sufficient honor
You were his taster in this heauenly nectar,
215
But now must quit the office.

Lam.
This is rare.
Cannot a man be master of his wife
Because she's young, and faire, without a pattent.
I in mine owne house am an Emperour,
220
And will defend whats mine, where are my knaues?
If such an insolence escape vnpunish'd.

Parth.
In your selfe Lamia. Caesar hath forgot
To vse his power, and I his instrument,
In whom though absent, his authoritie speakes,
225
Haue lost my faculties.
Stampes.

Lam.
The Guard! why am I
Enter a Centurion with Souldiers.
Design'd for death?

Domit.
As you desire my fauour
Take not so rough a course.

Parth.
230
All your desires
Are absolute commaunds. Yet giue me leaue
To put the will of Caesar into acte.
Heer's a bill of Diuorce betweene your Lordship,
And this great Lady. If you refuse to signe it,
235
And so as if you did it vncompell'd,
Wonne to it by reasons that concerne your selfe,
Her honour to vntainted. Here are Clearkes.
Shall in your best bloud write it newe, till torture
Compell you to performe it.

Lam.
240
Is this legall?

Par.
Monarchs that dare not doe vnlawfull things,
Yet bare them out are Constables, not Kings

Parth.
Will you dispute?

Lam.
I know not what to vrge
245
Against my selfe, but too much dotage on her
Loue and obseruance.

Parth.
Set it vnder your hand
That you are impotent, and cannot pay
The duties of a husband, or that you are mad
250
(Rather then want iust cause wee'l make you so)
Dispatch, you know the danger els, deliuer it
Nay on your knee. Madam you now are free
And Mistris of your selfe.

Lam.
Can you Domitia
255
Consent to this?

Domit.
'Twould argue a base minde
To liue a seruant, when I may commaund.
I now am C√¶sars, and yet in respect
I once was yours, when you come to the Pallace,
260
(Prouided you deserue it in your seruice)
You shall find me your good Mistris, waite me Parthenius
And now farewell poore Lamia.
Exeunt omnes preter Longinum.

Lam.
To the Gods
I bend my knees, (for tyrannie hath banish'd
265
Iustice from men) and as they would deserue
Their Altars, and our vowes, humbly inuoke'em
That this my rauish'd wife may proue as fatall
To proud Domitian, and her embraces
Affoord him in the end as little ioy,
270
As wanton Helen brought to him of Troy.
Exit.
ACTVS, I. SCAENA, 3.
Enter, Lictors, Arctinus, Fulcinius, Rusticus, Sura, Paris, Latinus, AEsopus.

Aret.
Fathers conscript may this our meeting be
Happie to Caesar and the common wealth.

Lict.
Silence.

Aret.
The purpose of this frequent Senate
275
Is first to giue thankes to the Gods of Rome,
That for the propagation of the Empire,
Vouchsafe vs one to gouerne it like themselues
In height of courage, depth of vnderstanding,
And all those vertues, and remarkeable graces,
280
Which make a Prince most eminent, our Domitian
Transcend's the ancient Romans. I can neuer
Bring his praise to a period. What good man
That is a friend to truth, dares make it doubtfull,
That he hath Fabius stay'dnesse, and the courage
285
Of bould Marcellus, to whom Hanibal gaue
The stile of Target, and the Sword of Rome.
But he has more, and euery touch more Roman
As Pompey's dignitie, Augustus state,
Antonies bountie, and great Iulius fortune.
290
With Catoes resolution. I am lost
In th'Ocean of his vertues. In a word
All excellencies of good men in him meet,
But no part of their vices.

Rust.
This is no flatterie!

Sur.
295
Take heed, you'l be obseru'd.

Aret.
'Tis then most fit
That we (as to the Father of our Countrie,
Like thankefull sonnes, stand bound to pay true seruice
For all those blessings that he showres vpon vs)
300
Should not conniue, and see his gouernment,
Deprau'd and scandaliz'd by meaner men
That to his fauour, and indulgence owe
Themselues and being.

Par.
Now he points at vs.

Aret.
305
Cite Paris the Tragedian.

Par.
Here.

Aret.
Stand forth.
In thee, as being the chiefe of thy profession,
I doe accuse the qualitie of treason,
310
As libellers against the state and Caesar.

Par.
Meere accusations are not proofes my Lord,
In what are we delinquents?

Aret.
You are they
That search into the secrets of the time,
315
And vnder fain'd names on the Stage present
Actions not to be toucht at; and traduce
Persons of rancke, and qualitie of both Sexes,
And with Satiricall. and bitter iests
Make euen the Senators ridiculous
320
To the Plebeans.

Par.
If I free not my selfe,
(And in my selfe the rest of my profession)
From these false imputations, and proue
That they make that a libell which the Poet
325
Writ for a Comedie, so acted too,
It is but Iustice that we vndergoe
The heauiest censure.

Aret.
Are you on the Stage
You talke so boldly?

Par.
330
The whole word being one
This place is not exempted, and I am
So confident in the iustice of our cause,
That I could wish Caesar, in whose great name
All Kings are comprehended sate as iudge,
335
To heare our Plea, and then determine of vs.
If to expresse a man sould to his lusts,
Wasting the treasure of his time and Fortunes,
In wanton dalliance, and to what sad end
A wretch thats so giuen ouer does arriue at,
340
Deterring carelesse youth, by his example,
From such licentious courses; laying open
The snares of baudes, and the consuming arts
Of prodigall strumpets, can deserue reproofe,
Why are not all your golden principles
345
Writ downe by graue Philosophers to instruct vs
To chuse faire Vertue for our guide, not pleasure,
Condemne vnto the fire?

Sura.
There's spirit in this.

Par.
Or if desire of honour was the base
350
On which the building of the Roman Empire
Was rais'd vp to this height; if to inflame
The noble youth with an ambitious heate
T'indure the frosts of danger, nay of Death
To be thought worthy the triumphall wreath
355
By glorious vndertakings, may deserue
Reward, or fauour, from the common wealth.
Actors may put in for as large a share
As all the sects of the Philosophers;
They which could precepts (perhaps seldome reade)
360
Deliver what an honourable thing
The actiue vertue is. But does that fire
The bloud, or swell the veines with emulation
To be both good, and great, equall to that
Which is presented on our Theaters?
365
Let a good Actor in a loftie Sceane
Show great Alcides honour'd in the sweate
Of his twelue labours; or a bould Cancillus
Forbidding Rome to be redeem'd with gold
From the insulting Gaul's; or Scipio
370
After his victories imposing Tribute
On conquer'd Carthage. If done to the life,
As if they saw their dangers, and their glories,
And did partake with them in their rewardes,
All that haue any sparke of Roman in them
375
The slothfull artes layd by, contend to bee
Like those they see presented.

Rust.
He ha's put
The Consuls to their whisper,

Par.
But 'tis vrg'd
380
That we corrupt youth, and traduce superiours:
When doe we bring a vice vpon the Stage,
That does goe off vnpunish'd? doe we teach
By the successe of wicked vndertakings,
Others to tread, in their forbidden steps?
385
We show no arts of Lidian Pandarisme,
Corinthian poysons, Persian flatteries,
But mulcted so in the conclusion that
Even those spectators that were so inclin'd,
Go home chang'd men. And for traducing such
390
That are aboue vs, publishing to the world
Their secret crimes we are as innocent
As such as are borne dumbe. When we present
An heyre, that does conspire against the life
Of his deare parent, numbring euery houre
395
He liues as tedious to him, if there be
Among the auditors one whose conscience tells him,
He is of the same mould we cannot helpe it.
Or bringing on the stage a loose adultresse,
That does maintaine the ryatous expence
400
Of him that feedes her greedie lust, yet suffers
The lawfull pledges of a former bed
To starue the while for hunger, if a Matron
Howeuer great in fortune, birth, or titles,
Guilty of such a foule vnnaturall sinne,
405
Crie out tis writ by me, we cannot helpe it:
Or when a couetous man's express'd, whose wealth
Arithmatique cannot number, and whose Lordships
A Falcon in one day cannot flie ouer
Yet he so sordid in his mind, so griping
410
As not to affoord himselfe the necessaries
To maintaine life, if a Patrician,
(Though honourd with a Consulship) finde himselfe
Touch'd to the quicke in this, we cannot helpe it.
Or when we show a Iudge that is corrupt
415
And will giue vp his sentence as he fauours,
The person, not the cause, sauing the guiltie
If of his faction, and as oft condemning
The innocent out of particular spleene,
If any in this reuerend assemblie,
420
Nay e'ne your selfe my Lord, that are the image
Of absent Caesar feele something in your bosome
That puts you in remembrance of things past,
Or things intended tis not in vs to helpe it.
I haue said, my Lord, and now as you finde cause
425
Or censure vs, or free vs with applause.

Lat.
Well pleaded on my life I neuer saw him
Act an Orators part before.

AEsop.
We might haue giuen
Ten double fees to Regulus, and yet
430
Our cause deliuered worse.
A shoute within, enter Parthenius.

Aret.
What shoute is that?

Parth.
Caesar our Lord married to conquest, is
Returnd in triumph.

Fulcin.
Lets all hast to meete him.

Aret.
435
Breake vp the Court, we will reserue to him
The Censure of this cause

All.
Long life to Caesar.
Exeunt omnes.

Caen.
Stand backe the place is mine.

Great Titus daughter, and Domitians neece
Dares any claime precedence?

Caen.
I was more
The mistris of your father, and in his right
Claime dutie from you.

Iul.

I confesse you were vsefull

Domit.
To end the controuersie,
For Ile haue no contending, Ile be bold
To leade the way my selfe.

Domitil.

You Minion!

Domit.
Yes
And all ere long shall kneele to catch my fauours.

Iul,
Whence springs this floud of greatnesse?

Domit.
You shall know

To soone for your vexation, and perhaps
Repent too late, and pine with enuie when
You see whom Caesar fauours

Iul.
Obserue the sequel.
Enter at one doore Captaines with Lawrels, Domitian, in his Triumphant Chariot, Parthenius, Paris, Latinus, AEsopus met by Aretinus, Sura, Lamia, Rusticus, Fulcinius, and prisoners led by him.

Caes.
As we now touch the height of humane glorie,
460
Riding in triumph to the Capitoll,
Let these whom this victorious arme hath made
The scorne of Fortune, and the slaues of Rome,
Tast the extreames of miserie. Beare them off
To the common prisons, and there let them proue
465
How sharpe our axes are.

Rust.
A bloudie entrance!

Caes.
To tell you, you are happie in your Prince
Were to distrust your loue, or my desert
And either were distastefull. Or to boast
470
How much, not by my Deputies, but my selfe,
I haue enlargd the Empire; or what horrors
The Souldier in our conduct hath broke through,
Would better suite the mouth of Plautus bragart,
Then the adored Monarch of the world.

Sura.
475
This is no boast.

Caes.
When I but name the Daci,
And gray ey'd Germans whom I haue subdu'd,
The Ghost of Iulius will looke pale with envie,
And great Vespatians, and Titus triumph,
480
(Truth must take place of Father and of Brother)
Will be no more remembred. I am aboue
All honours you can giue me. And the stile
Of Lord, and God, which thankefull subiects giue me
(Not my ambition) is deseru'd,

Aret.
485
At all parts
Coelestiall Sacrifice is fit for Caesar
In our acknowledgement.

Caes.
Thankes Aretinus
Still hold our fauour. Now; the God of warre,
490
And famine, bloud, and death, Bellonas Pages
Banish'd from Rome to Thrace in our good fortune.
With iustice he may taste the fruits of peace,
Whose sword hath plowd the ground, and reap'd the harvest
Of your prosperitie. Nor can I thinke
495
That there is one among you so vngratefull,
Or such an enemie, to thriuing vertue,
That can esteeme the iewell he holds deerest
Too good for Caesars vse

Sur.
All we possesse.

Lam.
500
Our liberties.

Fulcin.
Our children.

Parth.
Wealth.

Aret.
And throates
Fall willingly beneath his feete.

Rust.
505
Base flattery.
What Roman could indure this?

Caes.
This cals on
My loue to all, which spreads it selfe among you.
The beauties of the time I receiue the honour
510
To kisse the hand, which rear'd vp thus, holds thunder
To you 'tis an assurance of a calme.
Iulia my neece and Caenis the delight
Of old Vespatian, Domitilla to
A princesse of our bloud.

Rust.
515
Tis strange his pride
Affords no greater courtesie to Ladies
Of such high birth and rancke.

Sur.
Your wifes forgotten

Lam.
No shee will bee remembred feare it not
520
She will bee grac'd and greas'd.

Caes.
But when I looke on
Diuine Domitian, mee thinkes we should meete
(The lesser gods applauding the encounter)
As Iupiter the Giants lying dead
525
On the Phlegraean plaine imbrac't this Iuno
Lamia 'tis your honour that she's mine.

Lam.
You are too great to be gainesaid.

Caes.
Let all
That feare our frowne, or doe affect our fauour,
530
Without examining the reason why,
Salute her (by this kisse I make it good)
With the title of Augusta.

Domit.
Still your seruant,

All.
Long liue Augusta great Domitians Empresse.

Caes.
535
Paris my hand.

Par.
The Gods still honour Caesar.

Caes.
The wars are ended, and our armes layd by
We are for soft delights. Command the Poets
To vse their choisest, and most rare inuention
540
To entertaine the time, and be you carefull
To giue it action, Wee'l prouide the people
Pleasures of all kindes. My Domitia thinke not
I flatter, though thus fond, On to the Capitoll
Tis death to him that weares a sullen browe:
545
This tis to be a Monarch when alone
He can command all, but is aw'd by none
Exeunt.
The end of the first Acte.

ACTVS, II. SCAENA, 1.
Enter Philargus, Parthenius.

Philarg.
My sonne to tutor me. Know your obedience
And question not my will.

Parth.
Sir were I one
550
Whom want compeld to wish a full possession
Of what is yours. Or had I euer numbred
Your yeeres, or thought you liu'd to long, with reason
You then might nourish ill opinions of me.
Or did the suite that I prefer to you
555
Concerne my selfe, and aim'd not at your good
You might denie, and I sit downe with patience,
And after neuer presse you,

Philarg.
I' the name of Pluto
What wouldst thou haue me doe?

Parth.
560
Right to your selfe,
Or suffer me to doe it. Can you imagine
This nastie hat, this tatterd cloke, rent shooe,
This sordid linnen can become the master
Of your faire fortunes? whose superfluous meanes
565
(Though I were burthensome) could cloth you in
The costliest Persian silkes, studded with iewels
The spoyles of Prouinces, and euery day
Fresh change of Tirian purple.

Philarg.
Out vpon thee,
570
My monyes in my coffers melt to heare thee.
Purple, hence Prodigall. Shall I make my Mercer
Or Taylor my heyre, or see my Ieweller purchase
No, I hate pride.

Parth.
Yet decencie would doe well.
575
Though for your outside you will not be alterd,
Let me preuaile so farre yet, as to winne you
Not to denie your bellie nourishment;
Neither to thinke you haue feasted when 'tis cramm'd
With mouldie barley bread, onions, and leekes,
580
And the drinke of bondmen water.

Philarg.
Wouldst thou haue me
Bee an Apicius, or a Lucullus,
And ryot out my state in curious sawces?
Wise nature with a little is contented,
585
And following her, my guide, I cannot erre.

Parth.
But you destroy her in your want of care
(I blush to see, and speake it) to maintaine her
In perfect health and vigor, when you suffer
(Frighted with the charge of Phisicke) Rheumes, Catars,
590
The Scurfe, Ach in your bones to grow vpon you,
And hasten on your fate with too much sparing.
When a cheape Purge, a Vomit and good dyet
May lengthen it, giue me but leaue to send
The Emperors Doctor to you.

Philarg.
595
Ile be borne first
Halfe rotten to the fire, that must consume me,
His Pills, his Cordials, his Electuaries,
His Sirrups Iulips, Bezerstone nor his
Imagin'd Vnicornes horne comes in my bellie,
600
My mouth shall be a draught first, 'Tis resolu'd.
No; I'le not lessen my deare golden heape.
Which euerie houre increasing does renew.
My youth, and vigor, but if lessen'd, then,
Then my poore hartstrings cracke. Let me enioy it,
605
And brood ore't while I liue, it being my life,
My soule, my all. But when I turne to dust,
And part from what is more esteem'd by me
Then all the Gods, Romes thousand Altars smoke to,
Inherit thou my adoration of it,
610
And like me serue my Idoll.
Exit Philargus.

Parth.
What a strange torture
Is Auarice to it selfe! what man that lookes on
Such a penurious spectacle but must
Know what the fable meant of Tantalus,
615
Or the Asse whose backe is crack'd with curious viands
Yet feedes on thistles. Some course I must take,
To make my Father know what crueltie
He vses on himselfe.
Enter Paris.

Par.
Sir with your pardon,
620
I make bould to enquire the Emperours pleasure,
For, being by him commanded to attend
Your fauour may instruct vs what's his will.
Shall be this night presented?

Parth.
My lou'd Paris,
625
Without my intercession you well know
You may make your owne approaches, since his eare
To you is euer open.

Par.
I acknowledge
His clemencie to my weakenesse, and if euer.
630
I doe abuse it, lightning strike me dead,
The grace he pleases to conferre vpon me
(Without boast I may say so much) was neuer
Impoly'd to wrong the innocent, or to incense
His furie.

Parth.
635
'Tis confess'd many men owe you
For Prouinces they nere hop'd for; and their liues
Forfeited to his anger, you being absent,
I could say more.

Par.
You still are my good Patron.
640
And lay it in my fortune to deserue it,
You should perceiue the poorest of your clients
To his best abilities thankefull.

Parth.
I belieue so.
Met you my Father?

Par.
645
Yes Sir, with much griefe.
To see him as he is. Can nothing worke him
To be himselfe?

Parth.
O Paris 'tis a waight
Sits heauie here, and could this right hands losse
650
Remoue it, it should off but he is deafe
To all perswasion.

Par.
Sir with your pardon,
I'll offer my aduice! I once obseru'd
In a Tragedie of ours, in which a murther
655
Was acted to the life, a guiltie hearer
Forc'd by the terror of a wounded conscience,
To make discouerie of that, which torture
Could not wring from him. Nor can it appeare
Like an impossibilitie, but that
660
Your Father looking on a couetous man
Presented on the Stage as in a mirror
May see his owne deformity, and loath it.
Now could you but perswade the Emperour
To see a Comedie we haue that's stilde
665
The Cure of Avarice, and to command
Your Father to be a spectator of it,
He shall be so Anotamiz'd in the Scaene,
And see himselfe so personated; the basenes
Of a selfe torturing miserable wretch
670
Truely describ'd that I much hope the obiect
Will worke compunction in him.

Parth.
There's your fee
I ne're bought better counsaile. Be you in readines
I will effect the rest.

Par.
675
Sir when you please
Wee'l be prepar'd to enter. Sir the Emperour.
Exit. Paris.
Enter Caesar, Arctinus, Guard.

Caes.
Repine at vs?

Aret.
Tis, more, or my informers
That keepe strict watch vpon him are deceiu'd
680
In their intelligence there is a list
Of malecontents, as Iunius Rusticus
Palphurius, Sura, and this AElius, Lamia,
That murmure at your triumphs as meere Pageants;
And at their midnight meetings tax your iustice
685
(For so I stile what they call tyrannie)
For Paetus Thrasea's death, as if in him,
Vertue her selfe were murther'd; nor forget they
Agricola (who for his seruice done
In the reducing Britanie to obedience)
690
They dare affirme to be remou'd with poyson,
And he compeld to write you a cohaeyre
With his daughter, that his testament might stand,
Which else you had made void. Then your much loue
To Iulia your neece, censur'd as incest,
695
And done in scorne of Titus your dead brother;
But the divorce Lamia was forc'd to signe
To her, you honour with Augusta's title,
Being onely nam'd, they doe conclude there was
A Lucrece once, a Collatine, and a Brutus,
700
But nothing Roman left now, but in you
The lust of Tarquin.

Caes.
Yes. His fire, and scorne
Of such as thinke that our vnlimited power
Can be confin'd, dares Lamia pretend
705
An interest to that which I call mine?
Or but remember, she was euer his
That's now in our possession? fetch him hither.
The Gard goe of.
I'll giue him cause to wish he rather had
Forgot his owne name then e're mention'd hers.
710
Shall we be circumscrib'd? let such as cannot
By force make good their actions, though wicked
Conceale, excuse or qualifie their crimes:
What our desires grant leaue, and priuiledge to
Though contradicting all divine decrees,
715
Or lawes confirm'd by Romulus, and Numa,
Shall be held sacred.

Aret.
You should else take from
The dignitie of Caesar.

Caes.
Am I master
720
Of two and thirtie Legions, that awe
All Nations, of the triumphed world,
Yet tremble at our frowne, yeeld an accompt
Of whats our pleasure to a priuate man?
Rome perish first, and Atlas shoulders shrinke,
725
Heav'ns fabrique fall; the Sunne, the Moone, the Stars
Loosing their light, and comfortable heate,
Ere I confesse, that any fault of mine
May be disputed.

Aret.
So you preserue your power
730
As you should equall, and omnipotent heere,
With Iupiters aboue.
Parthenius kneeling whispers to Caesar.

Caes.
Thy suite is granted
What ere it be Parthenius for thy seruice
Done to Augusta. Onely so? a trifle.
735
Command him hither. If the Comedie faile
To cure him, I will minister something to him
That shall instruct him to forget his gold,
And thinke vpon himselfe.

Parth.
May it succeed well
740
Since my intents are pious.
Exit Parthenius.

Caes.
We are resolu'd
What course to take, and therefore Aretinus
Inquire no farther. Goe you to my Empresse,
And say I doe entreate (for she rules him
745
Whom all men else obey) she would vouchsafe
The musicke of her voice, at yonder window,
When I aduance my hand thus. I will blend
Exit Aretinus.
My crueltie with some scorne, or else tis lost.
Reuenge, when it is vnexpected falling,
750
With greater violence; and hate clothed in smiles,
Strikes, and with horror dead the wretch that comes not
Prepar'd to meete it. Our good Lamia welcome.
Enter Lamia with the Guard.
So much we owe you for a benefit
With willingnes on your part conferd vpon vs,
755
That ''tis our studie we that would not liue
Ingag'd to any for a courtesie,
How to returne it.

Lam.
'Tis beneath your fate
To be oblig'd that in your owne hand graspe
760
The meanes to be magnificent.

Caes.
Well put off
But yet it must not doe, the Empire, Lamia,
Diuided equally can hold no waight,
If ballanc'd with your guift in faire Domitia.
765
You that could part with all delights at once,
The magazine of rich pleasures being contain'd
In her perfections, vncompell'd deliuer'd.
As a Present fit for Caesar. In your eyes
With teares of ioy, not sorrow, 'tis confirm'd
770
You glory in your act.

Lam.
Derided too!
Sir this is more.

Caes.
More then I can requite
It is acknowledg'd Lamia. There's no drop
775
Of melting nectar I tast from her lippe,
But yeeldes a touch of immortalitie
To the blest receiuer; euery grace and feature,
Priz'd to the worth, bought at an easie rate;
If purchas'd for a Consulship. Her discourse.
780
So rauishing, and her action so attractiue,
That I would part with all my other senses
Prouided I might euer see, and heare her.
The pleasures of her bed I dare not trust
The windes or ayre with, for that would draw downe
785
In enuie of my happinesse, a warre
From all the Gods vpon mee.

Lam.
Your compassion
To me is your forbearing to insult
On my calamitie which you make your sport,
790
Would more appease those Gods you haue prouok'd
Then all the blasphemous comparisons,
You sing vnto her praise.

Caes.
I sing her praise?
'Tis farre from my ambition to hope it.
Musicke aboue and a song.
795
It being a debt she onely can lay downe,
And no tongue else discharge. Harke. I thinke prompted
With my consent that you once more should heare her,
She does begin. An vniuersall silence
Dwell on this place. 'Tis death with lingring torments
800
To all that dare disturbe her. Who can heare this
The song ended Caesar goe on.
And falls not downe and worships? in my fancie,
Apollo being iudge on Latinos hill,
Faire hayr'd Calliope on her iuorie Lute
(But something short of this) sung Ceres prayses
805
And grieslie Pluto's rape on Proserpine.
The motion of the Spheares are out of time
Her musicall notes but heard. Say Lamia, say,
Is not her voice Angelicall?

Lam.
To your eare.
810
But I alas am silent.

Caes.
Bee so euer,
That without admiration canst heare her.
Malice to my felicitie strikes thee dumbe,
And in thy hope, or wish to repossesse
815
What I loue more then Empire, I pronounce thee
Guiltie of treason. Off with his head. Doe you stare?
By her, that is my Patronesse, Minerua,
(Whose Statue I adore of all the Gods)
If he but liue to make reply thy life
The Guard lead off Lamia slopping his mouth.
820
Shal answer it. My feares of him are freed now
And he that liu'd to vpbraid me with my wrong
For an offence he neuer could imagine
In wantonnes remou'd. Descend my dearest.
Plurality of husbands shall no more
825
Breede doubts or iealousies in you. 'Tis dispatch'd
And with as little trouble heere, as if
I had kild a flye. Now you appeare and in
Enter Domitia, vsherd in by Aretinus, her traine with all state borne vp by Iulia, Caenis, and Domitilla.
That glorie you deserue, and these that stoope
To doe you seruice in the acte much honourd.
830
Iulia forget that Titus was thy Father,
Canis and Domitilla ne're remmeber
Sabinus, or Vespatian. To be slaues
To her, is more true liberty then to liue
Parthian or Asian Queenes. As lesser stars
835
That waite on Phaebe in her full of brightnes,
Compar'd to her you are (thus I seate you)
By Caesars side. Commanding these that once
Were the adored glories of the time
To witnes to the world they are your vassals
840
At your feete to attend you.

Domit.
Tis your pleasure
And not my pride. And yet when I consider
That I am yours, all duties they can pay
I doe receiue as circumstances due
845
To her you please to honour.
Enter Parthenius with Philargus.

Parth.
Caesars will
Commaunds you hither, nor must you gaine-say it.

Phil.
Loose time to see an Enterlude? must I pay to
For my vexation?

Parth.
850
Not in the Court,
It is the Emperours charge.

Phil.
I shall endure
My torment then the better.

Caes.
Can it bee
855
This sordid thing Parthenius is thy Father?
No actor can expresse him. I had held
The fiction for impossible in the Scaene,
Had I not seene the substance. Sirrha sit still,
And giue attention, if you but nod
860
You sleepe for euer. Let them spare the Prologue,
And all the Ceremonies proper to our selfe
And come to the last act, there where the cure
By the Doctor is made perfect. The swift minutes
Seeme yeeres to me Domitia that diuorce thee
865
From my embraces. My desires encreasing
As they are satisfied all pleasures else
Are tedious as dull sorrowes. Kisse me, againe:
If I now wanted heate of youth, these fires
In Priams veines would thaw his frozen bloud,
870
Enabling him to get a second Hector
For the defence of Troy.

Domit.
You are wanton?
Pray you forbeare. Let me see the Play.

Caes.
Begin there.
Enter Paris like a Doctor of Physicke, AEsopus, Latinus brought forth a sleepe in a chayre, a key in his mouth.

AEsop.
875
O master Doctor he is past recouerie
A lethargie hath ceas'd him. And howeuer
His sleepe resemble death his watchfull care
To guard that treasure he dares make no vse of,
Workes strongly in his soule.

Par.
880
What's that he holdes
So fast betweene his teeth?

AEsop.
The key that opens
His iron chests cramn'd with accursed gold,
Rustie with long imprisonment. There's no dutie
885
In me his sonne, nor confidence in friends,
That can perswade him to deliuer vp
That to the trust of any.

Philarg
He is the wiser
We were fashion'd in one mould.

AEsop.
890
He eates with it,
And when deuotion calles him to the Temple
Of Mammon, whom of all the Gods he kneeles to
That held thus still, his orisons are payde;
Or will he though, the wealth of Rome were pawn'd
895
For the restoring of it for one short houre
Be wonne to part with it.

Philarg.
Still, still my selfe.
And if like me he loue his gold, no pawne
Is good securitie.

Par.
900
I'll trie if I can force it.
It will not be. His auaritious mind
(Like men in riuers drown'd) makes him gripe fast
To his last gaspe what he in life held dearest.
And if that it were possible in nature
905
Would carry it with him to the other world.

Philarg.
As I would doe to hell rather then leaue it.

AEsop.
Is he not dead?
Long since to all good actions
Or to himselfe, or others, for which wise men
910
Desire to liue. You may with safetie pinch him,
Or vnder his nayles sticke needle, s yet he stirs not,
Anxious feare to loose what his soule dotes on
Renders his flesh insensible. We must vse
Some meanes to rouse the sleeping faculties
915
Of his mind, there lies the Lethargie. Take a Trumpet
And blowe it into his eares, tis to noe purpose
The roring noyse of thunder cannot wake him.
And yet despaire not I haue one tricke yet left

AEsop.
What is it?

Par.
920
I will cause a fearefull Dreame
To steale into his fancie, and disturbe it
With the horror it brings with it, and so free
His bodyes Organs.

Domit.
'Tis a cunning fellow,
925
If he were indeed a Doctor as the play sayes,
He should be sworne my seruant, gouerne my slumbers
And minister to me waking.

Par.
If this faile
A chest brought in.
I'll giue him ore. So with all violence
930
Rend ope this iron chest. For here is life lyes
Bound vp in fetters, and in the defence
Of what he values higher, 'twill returne
And fill each veine and arterie. Lowder yet.
'Tis open, and alreadie he begins
935
To stirre, marke with what trouble.
Latinus stretches himselfe.

Philarg.
As you are Caesar
Defend this honest thriftie man, they are theeues,
And come to rob him.

Parth.
Peace the Emperour frownes.

Par.
940
So now powre out the bags vpon the Table,
Romoue his iewels, and his bonds, againe.
Ring a second golden peale, his eyes are open.
He stares as he had seene Medusas head,
And were turn'd marble. Once more.

Lat.
945
Murther, murther,
They vs murther, murther. My sonne in the plot?
Thou worse then paracide if it bee death
To strike thy Fathers body, can all tortures,
The furies in hell practise, be sufficient
950
For thee that doest assassinate my soule?
My gold! my bounds! my iewels! dost thou envie
My glad possession of them for a day?
Extinguishing the Taper of my life
Consum'd vnto the snuffe?

Par.
955
Seem not to mind him.

Lat.
Haue I to leaue thee rich denied my selfe
The ioyes of humaine being? Scrap'd and horded
A masse of treasure, which had Solon seene
The Lidian Croesus had appear'd to him
960
Poore as the begger Irus. And yet I
Sollicitous to encrease it, when my intrayles
Were clem'd with keeping a perpetuall fast,
Was deafe to their loud windie cries, as fearing
Should I disburse one peny to their vse,
965
My heyre might curse me. And to saue expence
In outward ornaments, I did expose
My naked body to the Winters cold,
And summers scorching heate. Nay when diseases
Grew thicke vpon me, and a little cost
970
Had purchas'd my recouerie, I chose rather
To haue my ashes clos'd vp in my vrne,
By hasting on my fate, then to diminish
The gold my prodigall sonne, while I am liuing,
Carelessely scatters.

AEsop.
975
Would you would dispatch and die once.
Your Ghost should feele in hell, that is my slaue
Which was your master.

Philarg.
Out vpon thee varlet.

Par.
And what then followes al your carke, and caring,
980
And selfe affliction when your staru'd truncke is
Turn'd to forgotten dust? This hopefull youth
Vrines vpon your monument. Ne're remembring
How much for him you suffer'd. And then tells
To the companions of his lusts, and ryots,
985
The hell you did indure on earth to leaue him
Large meanes to be an Epicure, and to feast
His senses all at once, a happines
You neuer granted to your selfe. Your gold then
(Got with vexation, and preseru'd with trouble)
990
Maintaines the publicke stewes, pandars, and ruffians
That quaffe damnations to your memorie,
For liuing so long here.

Lat.
'T will be so, I see it.
O that I could redeeme the time that's past
995
I would liue, and die like my selfe; and make true vse
Of what my industrie purchas'd.

Par.
Couetous men
Hauing one foote in the graue lament so euer.
But grant that I by Art could yet recouer
1000
Your desperate sicknes, lengthen out your life
A dozen of yeeres, as I restore your body
To perfect health, will you with care endeuour
To rectifie your mind

Lat.
I should so liue then
1005
As neither my heyre should haue iust cause to thinke
I liu'd too long for being close handed to him,
Or cruell to my selfe.

Par.
Haue your desires
Phaebus assisting, mee I will repayre
1010
The ruin'd building of your health, and thinke not
You haue a sonne that hates you; the truth is
This meanes with his consent I practis'd on you,
To this good end, it being a deuice
In you to shew the Cure of Avarice.
Exeunt Paris, Latinus, AEsopus.

Phil.
1015
An old foole to be guld thus I had he died
As I resolue to doe, not to be alter'd,
It had gone off twanging.

Caes.
How approue you sweetest,
Of the matter, and the Actors?

Domit.
1020
For the subiect
I like it not, it was filch'd out of Horace,
Nay I haue read the Poets but the fellow
That play'd the Doctor did it well by Venus;
He had a tunable tongue and neate deliuery,
1025
And yet in my opinion he would performe
A louers part much better. Prethee Caesar
For I grow wearie let vs see to morrow
Iplus and Anaxerete.

Caes.
Any thing
1030
For thy delight Domitia. To your rest
Till I come to disquiet you. Wayte vpon her.
There is a busines that I must dispatch
And I will straight be with you.
Exeunt Aretinus, Domitia, Iulia, Canis, Domitilla.

Parth.
Now my dread Sir
1035
Endeuour to preuayle.

Caes.
One way or other.
Wee'l cure him neuer doubt it. Now Philargus
Thou wretched thing, hast thou seene thy sordid basenesse?
And but obseru'd what a contemptible creature
1040
A couetous miser is? dost thou in thy selfe
Feele true compunction! with a resolution
To be a new man?

Philarg.
This craz'd bodies Caesars,
But for my minde.

Caes.
1045
Trifle not with my anger.
Canst thou make good vse of what was now presented?
And imitate in thy suddaine change of life,
The miserable rich man, that expres'd
What thou art to the life.

Philarg.
1050
Pray you giue me leaue
To dye as I haue liu'd. I must not part with
My gold, it is my life. I am past cure.

Caes.
No; by Minerua thou shalt neuer more
Feele the least touch of auarice. Take him hence
1055
And hang him instantly. If there be gold in hell
Inioy it, thine here and thy life together
Is forfeited.

Philarg.
Was I sent for to this purpose?

Parth.
Mercie for all my seruice, Caesar mercie

Caes.
1060
Should Ioue pleade for him. 'Tis resolu'd he dyes,
And he that speakes one sillable to disswade me,
And therefore tempt me not. It is but iustice.
Since such as wilfully, will hourely dye,
Must tax themselues, and not my crueltie.
Exeunt omnes.
The end of the second Act.

ACTVS, III. SCAENA, 1.
Enter Iulia, Domitilla, Stephanos.

Iul.
1065
No Domitilla, if you but compare
What I haue suffer'd with your iniuries,
(Though great ones I confesse) they will appeare
Like molehils to Olimpus.

Domitil.
You are tender
1070
Of your owne wounds, which makes you loose the feeling
And sense of mine. The incest he committed
With you, and publikely profes'd, in scorne
Of what the world durst censure may admit
Some weake defence, as being borne headlong to it.
1075
But in a manly way to enioy your beauties.
Besides wonne by his periuries that he would
Salute you with the title of Augusta,
Your faint deniall show'd a full consent,
And grant to his temptations. But poore I
1080
That would not yeeld, but was with violence forc'd
To serue his lusts, and in a kinde Tiberius
At Caprae neuer practis'd, haue not heere
One conscious touch to rise vp my accuser
I in my will being innocent.

Steph.
1085
Pardon mee
Great Princesses, though I presume to tell you
Wasting your time in childish lamentations,
You doe degenerate from the bloud you spring from:
For there is something more in Rome expected
1090
From Titus daughter, and his vncles heyre,
Then womanish complaints after such wrongs
Which mercie cannot pardon. But you'l say
Your hands are weake, and should you but attempt
A iust reuenge on this inhumaine monster.
1095
This prodegie of mankind bloudie Domitian,
Hath readie words at his command aswell
As Islands to confine you to remoue.
His doubts, and feares, did he but entertaine
The least suspition you contriu'd or plotted
1100
Against his person.

Iul.
'Tis true Stephanos.
The legions that sacred Hierusalem
Vnder my Father Titus are sworne his,
And I no more remembred.

Domit.
1105
And to loose
Our selues by building on impossible hopes,
Were desperate madnes.

Steph.
You conclude too fast.
One single arme whose master does contemne
1110
His owne life holds a full command ore his,
Spite of his guards. I was your bondman Ladie,
And you my gracious patronesse; my wealthe
And libertie your guift, and though no souldier,
To whom or custome, or example makes
1115
Grimme death appeare lesse terrible, I dare dye
To doe you seruice in a faire reuenge
And it will better suite your births and honours
To fall at once, then to liue euer slaues
To his proud Empresse that insults vpon
1120
Your patient sufferings. Say but you goe on,
And I will retch his heart, or perish in
The noble vndertaking.

Domit.
Your free offer
Confirmes your thankefulnesse, which I acknowledge
1125
A satisfaction for a greater debt
Then what you stand ingag'd for: but I must not
Vpon vncertaine grounds hazard so gratefull,
And good a seruant. The mortall powers
Protect a Prince though sould to impious acts,
1130
And seeme to slumber till his roaring crimes
Awake their iustice: but then looking downe
And with impartiall eyes, on his contempt
Of all religion, and morrall goodnesse,
They in their secrets indgements doe determine
1135
To leaue him to his wickednesse, which sinckes him
When he is most secure.

Iul.
His crueltie
Increasing dayly of necessitie
Must render him as odious to his souldiers,
1140
Familiar friends, and freemen, as it hath done
Alreadie to the Senate; then forsaken
Of his supporters, and growne terrible
Eu'n to himselfe, and her, he now so dotes on,
We may put into act, what now with safetie
1145
We cannot whisper,

Steph.
I am still prepar'd
To execute when you please to command mee:
Since I am confident he deserues much more
That vindicates his countrie from a tyrannie,
1150
Then he that saues a citizen.

Iul.
O heere's Caenis.
Enter Caenis.

Domitil.
Whence come you?

Caen.
From the Empresse who seemes mou'd
In that you waite no better. Her prides growne
1155
To such a height that shee disdaines the service
Of her owne women; and esteemes her selfe
Neglected? when the Princesses of the bloud
On everie course imployment, are not readie
To stoope to her commands.

Domitil.
1160
Where is her greatnes?

C√¶n.
Where you would little thinke she could descend
To grace the roome or persons.

Iul.
Speake; where is she?

C√¶n.
Among the Players, where all state layd by,
1165
She does enquire who acts this part, who that,
And in what habits? blames the tire-women
For want of curious dressings; and so taken
She is with Paris the Tragedians shape
That is to act a Louer, I thought once
1170
She would haue courted him.

Domitil.
In the meane time
How spends the Emperour his houres?

Caen.
As euer
He hath done heretofore in being cruell
1175
To innocent men, whose vertues he calles crimes.
And but this morning if't be possible
He hath out-gone himselfe, hauing condemn'd
At Aretinus his informers suite,
Palphurius Sura, and good Iunius Rusticus,
1180
Men of the best repute in Rome for their
Integritie of life; no fault obiected
But that they did lament his cruell sentence
On Paetus Thraseas the Philosopher
Their Patron and instructer.

Steph.
1185
Can Ioue see this
And hold his thunder!

Domitil.
Nero and Caligula
Commanded onely mischiefes but our Caesar
Delights to see'em.

Iul.
1190
What we cannot helpe,
We may deplore with silence.

Caen.
We are call'd for
By our proud mistresse.

Domit.
We a while must suffer.

Steph.
1195
It is true fortitude to stand firme against
All shocks of fate, when cowards faint and dye
In feare to suffer more calamitie.
Exeunt.
ACTVS, III. SCAENA, 2.
Enter Caesar, Parthenius.

Caes.
They are then in fetters.

Parth.
Yes Sir. But

Caes.
1200
But? What?
I'll haue thy thoughts. Deliuer them.

Parth.
I shall Sir.
But still submitting to your God-like pleasure
Which cannot be instructed?

Caes.
1205
To the point.

Parth.
Nor let your sacred Maiestie belieue
Your vassall, that with drie eyes look'd vpon
His Father drag'd to death by your command,
Can pitty these, that durst presume to censure
1210
What you decreed.

Caes.
Well. Forward.

Parth.
'Tis my zeale
Still to preserue your clemencie admi'rd
Temper'd with iustice, that emboldens me
1215
To offer my aduice. Alas I know Sir
These Bookemen, Rusticus, and Pulphurius Sura,
Deserue all tortures. Yet in my opinion,
They being popular Senators, and cried vp
With loud applauses of the multitude,
1220
For foolish honestie, and beggerly vertue,
T'would rellish more of pollicie to haue them
Made away in priuate, with what exquisite torments
You please it skils not, then to haue them drawne
To the degrees in publike; for 'tis doubted
1225
That the sad obiect may beget compassion
In the giddie rout, and cause some sudaine uprore
That may disturbe you.

Caes.
Hence pale spirited coward
Can we descend so farre beneath our selfe
1230
As, or to court, the peoples loue, or feare
Their worst of hate? Can they that are as dust
Before the whirlewinde of our will and power,
Adde any moment to vs? Or thou thinke
If there are Gods aboue, or Goddesses,
1235
(But wise Minerua that's mine owne and sure)
That they haue vacant houres to take into
Their serious protection, or care.
This many headed monster? mankind liues
In few, as potent Monarchs, and their Peeres,
1240
And all those glorious constellations
That doe adorne the firmament, appointed
Like groomes with their bright influence to attend
The actions of Kings, and Emperours,
They being the greater wheeles that moue the lesse.
1245
Bring forth those condemn'd wretches let me see
One man so lost, as but to pittie 'em
And though there lay a million of soules
Imprison'd in his flesh my Hangmens hookes
Should rend it off and giue 'em libertie.
1250
Caesar hath said it.
Exit Parthenius.
Enter Parthenius, Aretinus, and the Guard, Hangmen dragging in Iunius, Rusticus, and Palphurius Sura, bound backe to backe.

Aret.
'Tis great Caesars pleasure
That with fix'd eyes you carefully obserue
The peoples lookes. Charge vpon any man
That with a sigh, or murmure does expresse
1255
A seeming sorrow for these traytors deaths,
You know his will, performe it.

Caes.
A good bloud-hound,
And fit for my imployments.

Sur.
Giue vs leaue
1260
To dye fell tyrant.

Rust.
For beyond our bodies
Thou hast no power.

Caes.
Yes I'll afflict your soules.
And force them groaning to the Stigian lake
1265
Prepar'd for such to howle in, that blaspheame
The power of Princes, that are Gods on earth;
Tremble to thinke how terrible the dreame is
After this sleepe of death.

Rust.
To guiltie men
1270
It may bring terror, not to vs, that know
What 'tis to dye, well taught by his example
For whom we suffer. In my thought I see
The substance of that pure vntainted soule,
Of Thraseas our master made a starre,
1275
That with melodious harmonie invites vs
(Leauing this dunghill Rome, made hell by thee,)
To trace his heauenly steps, and fill a Spheare
Aboue yon Chrystall Canopie.

Caes.
Doe inuoke him
1280
With all the aydes his sanctitie of life
Haue wonne on the rewarders of his vertue,
They shall not saue your Dogs doe you grinne? torment 'em.
So take a leafe of Seneca now and proue
If it can render you insensible
1285
Of that which but begins here. Now an oyle
The Hangmen torment 'em, they still smiling.
Drawne from the Stoicks frozen principles
Predominant ouer fire were vsefull for you.
Againe, againe. You trifle. Not a groane,
Is my rage lost? What cursed charmes defend 'em!
1290
Search deeper villaines. Who lookes pale? or thinkes
That I am cruell?

Aret.
Ouer mercifull.
all your weakenesse Sir.

Parth.
I dare not show
1295
A signe of sorrow, yet my synnewes shrinke
The spectacle is so horrid.
Aside.

Caes.
I was neuer
O'recome till now. For my sake rore a little,
And show you are corporeall, and not turn'd
1300
Aeriall spirits. Will it not do. By Pallas
It is vnkindly done to mocke his furle
Whom the world stiles omnipotent. I am tortur'd
In their want of feeling torments. Marius storie
That does report him to haue sate vnmou'd
1305
When cunning Chirurgions rip'd his arteries,
And veines, to cure his goute compar'd to this
Deserues not to bee nam'd. Are they not dead?
If so, wee wash an AEthiope.

Sur.
No, wee liue.

Rust.
1310
Liue to deride thee, our calme patience treading
Vpon the necke of tyrannie. That securely,
(As t'were a gentle slumber,) we indure
Thy hangmens studied tortures, is a debt
Wee owe to graue Philosophie, that instruct's vs
1315
The flesh is but the clothing of the soule
Which growing out of fashion though it bee
Cast of, or rent, or torne, like ours, 'tis then
Being it selfe diuine, in her best luster.
But vnto such as thou, that haue no hopes
1320
Beyond the present, euerie little scar;
The want of rest; excesse of heate or, cold
That does informe them, onely they are mortall,
Pierce through, and through them.

Caes.
We will heare no more,

Rust.
1325
This onely, and I give thee warning of it.
Though it is in thy will to grinde this earth,
As small as Atomes, they throwne in the Sea to.
They shall seeme recollected to thy sense,
And when the sandie building of thy greatnes,
1330
Shall with its owne weight totter; looke to see me
As I was yesterday, in my perfect shape,
For I'll appeare in horror.

Caes.
By my shaking
I am the guiltie man, and not the Iudge.
1335
Drag from my sight, these cursed ominous wizards,
That as they are now like to double fac'd Ianus
Which way soe're I looke, are furies to me.
Away with 'em. First show them death, then leaue
Exeunt Hangmen with Rusticus and Sura. Stephanos following.
No memory of their ashes I'll mocke fate.
1340
Shall words fright him, victorious armies circle?
No, no, the feuer does begin to leaue me.
Enter Domitia, Iulia, Caenis.
Or were it deadly, from this liuing fountaine
I could renue the vigor of my youth,
And be a second Verbius. O my glory!
1345
My life I command I my all!
Embracing and kissing mutually.

Domit.
As you to me are.
I heard you were sad; I haue prepar'd you sport
Will banish melancholie. Sirrha, Caesar,
(I hugge my selfe for't) I haue beene instructing
1350
The Players how to act, and to cut off
All tedious impertinencie, haue contracted
The Tragedie, into one continued Sceane.
I haue the art of't, and am taken more
With my abilitie that way, then all knowledge
1355
I haue but of thy loue.

Caes.
Thou art still thy selfe,
The sweetest, wittiest.

Domit.
When wee are a bed
I'll thanke your good opinion. Thou shalt see
1360
Such an Iphis of thy Paris, and to humble
The pride of Domitilla that neglects mee
(How e're she is your cousin) I haue forc'd her
To play the part of Anaxerete.
You are not offended with it?

Caes.
1365
Any thing
That does content thee yeilds delight to mee.
My faculties, and powers are thine.

Domit.
I thanke you
Prethee lets take our places. Bid'em enter
After a short flourish, enter Paris as Iphis.
1370
Without more circumstance, how doe you like
That shape? me thinkes it is most sutable
To the aspect of a despairing louer.
The seeming late falne, counterfeited teares
That hang vpon his cheekes, was my deuice.

Caes.
1375
And all was excellent.

Domit.
Now heare him speake.

Par.
That she is faire (and that an Epethite
To foule to expresse her or descended nobly,
Or rich, or fortunate, and certaine truthes
1380
In which poore Iphis glories. But that these
Perfections, in no other Virgin found,
Abus'd, should nourish crueltie, and pride,
In the diuinest Anaxarete,
Is, to my loue-sicke languishing soule, a riddle,
1385
And with more difficultie to be dissolu'd,
Then that, the monster Sphinx from the steepie rocke
Offer'd to Oedipus. Imperious loue,
As at thy euer flaming Altars Iphis
Thy neuer tyred votarie hath presented
1390
With scalding teares whose Hecatombes of sighes,
Preferring thy power, and thy Paphian mothers
Before the thunderers, Neptunes, or Pluto's
(That after Saturne did diuide the world
And had the sway of things) yet were compell'd
1395
By thy vneuitable shafts to yeeld
And sight vnder thy ensignes, be auspicious
To this late tryall of my sacrifice
Of loue, and seruice.

Domit.
Do's he not act it rarely?
1400
Obserue with what a feeling he deliuers
His orisons to Cupid; I am rap'd with't.

Par.
And from thy neuer emptied quiuer take
A golden arrow, to transfix her heart
And force her loue like me, or cure my wound
1405
With a leaden one, that may beget in me
Hate and forgetfulnesse, of what's now my Idoll.
But I call backe my prayer, I haue blaspheam'd
In my rash wish. 'Tis I that am vnworthy,
But she all merit, and may in iustice challenge
1410
From the assurance of her excellencies
Not loue, but adoration. Yet beare witnesse
All knowing powers, I bring along with me
As faithfull aduocates to make intercession
A loyall heart, with pure, and holy flames
1415
With the foule fires of lust neuer polluted.
And as I touch her threshold (which with teares
My limbes benumb'd with cold, I oft haue wash'd)
With my glad lips I kisse this earth growne proud
With frequent fauours from her delicate feete.

Domit.
1420
By Caesars life he weepes. And I forbeare
Hardly to keepe him companie.

Par.
Blest ground thy pardon
If I prophane it with forbidden steps.
I must presume to knocke, and yet attempt it
1425
With such a trembling reuerence as if
My hands held vp, for expiation
To the incensed Gods to spare a kingdome.
Within there, hoe? something divine come forth
To a distressed mortall.
Enter Latinus as a Porter.

Lat.
1430
Ha! Who knockes there?

Domit.
What a churlish looke this knaue has

Lat.
Is't you Sirrha?
Are you come to pule and whine? avaunt, and quickly.
Dogwhips shall driue you hence else.

Domit.
1435
Churlish deuill?
But that I should disturbe the Sceane, as I liue
I would teare his eyes out.

Caes.
'Tis in iest Domitia,

Domit.
I doe not like such iesting, if he were not
1440
A flintie hearted slave, he could not vse
One of his forme so harshly. How the toade swells
At the others sweete humilitie!

Caes.
'Tis his part
Let 'em proceed.

Domit.
1445
A Rogues part, will ne're leaue him

Par.
As you haue gentle Sir, the happinesse
(When you please) to behold the figure of
The master peice of nature, limn'd to the life,
In more then humane Anaxerete,
1450
Scorne not your seruant, that with suppliant hands
Takes hold vpon your knees, coniuring you
As you are a man, and did not sucke the milke
Of Wolues, and Tigres, or a mother of
A tougher temper, vse some meanes these eyes
1455
Before they are wept out, may see your Ladie.
Will you be gracious Sir?

Lat.
Though I loose my place for't
I can hold out no longer.

Domit.
Now hee melts
1460
There is some little hope hee may die honest

Lat.
Madam.
Enter Domitilla for Anaxerete.

Domit.
Who calls? what obiect haue we heere?

Domit.
Your cousin keepes her proud state still I thinke
I haue fitted her for a part.

Domit.
1465
Did I not charge thee
I ne're might see this thing more?

Par.
I am indeed
What thing you please, a Worme that you may tread on,
Lower I cannot fall to shew my duty,
1470
Till your disdaine hath dig'd a graue to couer
This bodie with forgotten dust, and when
I know your sentence, cruellest of women)
I'll by a willing death remoue the obiect
That is an eyesore to you.

Domit.
1475
Wretch thou darst not.
That were the last, and greatest seruice to mee
Thy doting loue could boast of. What dull foole
But thou could nourish any flattering hope
One of my height, in youth, in birth and fortune
1480
Could e're desend to looke vpon thy lownesse?
Much lesse consent to make my Lord of one
I would not accept, though offre'd for my slaue,
My thoughts stoope not so lowe.

Domit.
There's her true nature
1485
No personated scorne.

Domit.
I wrong my worth
Or to exchange a syllable or looke,
With one so farre beneath me.

Par.
Yet take heed,
1490
Take heed of pride, and curiouslie consider
How brittle the foundation is, on which
You labour to aduance it. Niobe
Proud of her numerous issue durst contemne
Latonas double burthen but what follow'd?
1495
She was left a childlesse mother, and mourn'd to marble.
The beautie you o're-prize so, time, or sicknes
Can change to loth'd deformitie, Your wealth
The prey of theeues; Queene Heccuba Troy fir'd
Vlisses bond-woman. But the loue I bring you
1500
Nor time, nor sicknesse, violent theeues, nor fate
Can rauish from you.

Domit.
Could the Oracle
Giue better counsaile.

Par.
Say will you relent yet?
1505
Reuoking your decree that I should dye?
Or shall I doe what you command? resolue
I am impatient of delay.

Domit.
Dispatch then
I shall looke on your Tragedie vnmou'd,
1510
Peraduenture laugh at it, for it will proue
A Comedie to me.

Domit.
O diuell! diuell!

Par.
Then thus I take my last leaue. All the curses
Of louers fall vpon you; and hereafter
1515
When any man like me contemn'd, shall studie
In the anguish of his soule to giue a name
To a scornfull cruell mistresse, let him onely
Say this most bloudie woman is to me.
As Anaxerete was to wretched Iphis.
1520
Now feast your tyrannous mind, and glorie in
The ruines you haue made: for Hymens bands
That should haue made vs one, this fatall halter
For euer shall diuorce vs; at your gate
As a trophee of your pride, and my affliction,
1525
I'll presently hang my selfe.

Domit.
Not for the world.
Restraine him as you loue your liues.

Caes.
Why are you
Transported thus Domitia? 'tis a play,
1530
Or grant it serious, it at no part merits.
This passion in you.

Par.
I nere purpos'd Madam
To do the deed in earnest, though I bowe
To your care, and tendernesse of me.

Domit.
1535
Let me Sir,
Intreate your pardon, what I saw presented
Carried me beyond my selfe.

Caes.
To your place againe
And see what followes

Domit.
1540
No I am familiar
With the conclusion, besides vpon the sudaine
I feele my selfe much indispos'd.

Caes.
To bed then
I'll be thy Doctor.

Areo.
1545
There is something more
In this then passion, which I must find out,
Or my intelligence freezes.

Domit.
Come to me Paris
To morrow for your reward

Steph.
1550
Patronesse heare mee
Will you not call for your share? sit downe with this,
And the next action like a Gaditane strumpet
I shall looke to see you tumble.

Domit.
Prethee be patient.
1555
I that haue sufferd greater wrongs beare this
And that till my reuenge my comfort is.
Exeunt.
The end of the third Act.

ACTVS, IIII. SCAENA, 1.
Enter Parthenius, Iulia, Domitilla, Caenis.

Parth.
Why 'tis impossible Paris?

Iul.
You obseru'd not
(As it appeares) the violence of her passion,
1560
When personating Iphis, he pretended
(For your contempt faire Anaxerete)
To hang himselfe.

Parth.
Yes, yes, I noted that;
But neuer could imagine it could worke her
1565
To such a strange intemperance of affection,
As to dote on him.

Domit.
By my hopes I thinke not
That she respects though all heere saw, and mark'd it
Presuming she can mould the Emperours will
1570
Into what forme she likes, though we, and all
Th'informers of the world conspir'd to crosse it.

Caen.
Then with what eagernesse this morning vrging
The want of health, and rest, she did intreate
Caesar to leaue her.

Domit.
1575
Who no sooner absent
But she calls Dwarfe (so in her scorne she stiles me)
Put on my pantofles, fetch pen, and paper
I am to write, and with distracted lookes,
In her smocke, impatient of so short delay
1580
As but to haue a mantle throwne vpon her,
She seal'd I know not what but 'twas indorsed
To my lou'd Paris.

Iul.
Adde to this I heard her
Sav, when a page receiu'd it; let him waite me
1585
And carefully in the walke, cal'd our retreate,
Where Caesar in his feare to giue offence,
Vnsent for neuer enters.

Parth.
This being certaine
(For these are more then iealous suppositions)
1590
Why doe not you that are so neere in bloud
Discouer it?

Domit.
Alas you know wee dare not.
'Twill be receaued for a malicious practise
To free vs from that slauerie, which her pride
1595
Imposes on vs. But if you would please
To breake the ice on paine to be suncke euer
We would auerre it.

Parth.
I would second you,
But that I am commanded with all speede
1600
To fetch in Ascletario the Chaldaean
Who in his absence is condemn'd of treason
For calculating the natiuitie
Of Caesar, with all confidence fore-telling
In euerie circumstance when he shall die
1605
A violent death. Yet if you could approue
Of my directions I would haue you speake
As much to Aretinus, as you haue
To me deliuer'd. He in his owne nature
Being a spie, on weaker grounds no doubt
1610
Will vndertake it, not for goodnesse sake
(With which he neuer yet held correspondence)
But to endea're his vigilant obseruings
Of what concernes the Emperour, and a little
To triumph in the ruines of this Paris
Enter Aretinus.
1615
That cros'd him in the Senate house. Here he comes
His nose held vp, he hath something in the winde,
Or I much erre alreadie. My designes
Command me hence great Ladies, but I leaue
My wishes with you.
Exit Parthenius.

Aret.
1620
Haue I caught your greatnes
In the trap my proud Augusta?

Domit.
What is't saps him?

Aret.
And my fine Roman Actor? is't euen so?
No courser dish to take your wanton palate
1625
Saue that which but the Emperour none durst cast off?
T'is very well. I needs must glory in
This rare discouerie, but the rewards
Of my intelligence, bid me thinke even now,
By an edict from Caesar I haue power,
1630
To tread vpon the necke of slauish Rome,
Disposing offices, and Prouinces,
To my kinsmen, friends and clients.

Domit.
This is more
Then vsuall with him,

Iul.
1635
Aretinus?

Aret.
How?
No more respect and reuerence tender'd to mee
But Aretinus! 'tis confess'd that title
When you were Princesses, and commanded all
1640
Had beene a fauour; but being as you are
Vassals to a proud woman, the worst bondage,
You stand oblig'd with as much adoration
To entertaine him, that comes arm'd with strength,
To breake your fetters, as tand gallie-slaues
1645
Pay such as doe redeeme them from the oare
I come not to intrap you, But aloud
Pronounce that you are manumiz'd, and to make
Your libertie sweeter, you shall see her fall,
(This Empresse, this Domitia, what you will)
1650
That triumph'd in your miseries.

Domit.
Were, you serious
To proue your accusation, I could lend
Some helpe.

Caen.
And I.

Iul.
1655
And I.

Aret.
No atome to mee.
My eyes, and eares are euery where, I know all,
To the line and action in the play that tooke her;
Her quicke dissimulation to excuse
1660
Her being transported, with her morning passion;
I brib'd the boy that did conuey the letter,
And hauing perus'd it, made it vp againe:
Your griefes, and angers, are to me familiar;
That Paris is brought to her, and how farre,
1665
He shall be tempted.

Domit.
This is aboue wonder.

Aret.
My gold can worke much stranger miracles
Then to corrupt poore waiters. Heere ioyne with me
'Tis a complaint to Caesar. This is that
1670
Shall ruine her, and raise you. Haue you set your hands
To the accusation.

Iul.
And will iustifie
What we haue subscrib'd to.

Caen.
And with vehemencie.

Domit.
1675
I will deliuer it.

Aret.
Leaue the rest to me then
Enter Caesar with his Guard.

Caes.
Let our Lieutenants bring vs victory,
While we enioy the fruites of peace at home,
And being secur'd from our intestiue foes,
1680
Far worse then forreine enemies, doubts, and feares,
Though all the skie were hung with blazing meteors,
Which fond Astrologers giue out to be
Assur'd presages of the change of Empires,
And deaths of Monarchs, wee vndaunted yet
1685
Guarded with our owne thunder, bid defiance,
To them, and fate, we being too strongly arm'd
For them to wound vs.
Aret. Caesar.

Iul.
As thou art
More then a man.

Caen.
1690
Let not thy passions bee
Rebellious to thy reason.
The Petition deliuer'd.

Domit.
But receiue
This tryall of your constancie, as vnmou'd
As you goe to, or from the Capitoll,
1695
Thankes giuen to loue for triumphs?

Caes.
Ha!

Domit.
Vouchsafe
A while to stay the lightning of your eyes.
Poore mortalls dare not looke on.

Aret.
1700
There's no veine
Of yours, that rises high with rage, but is
An earthquake to vs.

Domit.
And if not kept clos'd
With more then humaine patience in a moment
1705
Will swallow vs to the center.

Caen.
Not that we
Repine to serue her, are we her accusers.

Iul.
But that she's falne so low.

Aret.
Which on sure proofes
1710
VVe can make good.

Domitil.
And Show she is vnworthie
Of the least sparke of that diuiner fire
You haue confer'd vpon her.

Caes.
I stand doubtfull.
1715
And vnresolu'd what to determine of you.
In this malicious violence you haue offer'd
To the Altar of her truth, and purenesse to me,
You haue but fruitlesly labour'd to sullye
A white robe of perfection, black mouth'd enuie
1720
Could belch no spot on. But I will put off
The deitie, you labour to take from me,
And argue out of probabilities with you
As if I weare a man. Can I beleeue
That she, that borrowes all her light from me,
1725
And knowes to vse it, would betray her darkness
To your intelligence, and make that apparent.
Which by her perturbations in a play
VVas yesterday but doubted and find none,
But you that are her slaues, and therefore hate her
1730
VVhose aydes she might imploy to make way for her?
Or Aretinus whom long since she knew
To be the Cabinet counsailor, nay the key
Of Caesars secrets? could her beauty raise her
To this vnequald height to make her fall
1735
The more remarkable? or must my desires
To her, and wrongs to Lamia be reuengd
By her, and on herselfe that drewe on both?
Or she leaue our imperiall bed to court
A publicke actor?

Aret.
1740
who dares contradict
These more then humain reasons, that haue power
To cloth base guilt, in the most glorious shape
Of innocence?

Domit.
To wel she knew the strength,
1745
And eloquence of her patron to defend her,
And thereupon presuming fell securely,
Not fearing an accuser, nor the truth,
Produc'd against her, which your loue and sauour
Will ne're discerne from falshood.

Caes.
1750
I'll not heere
A syllable more that may inuite a change
In my opinion of her. You haue rais'd,
A fiercer war within me by this fable,
(Though with your liues you vowe to make it storie)
1755
Then if, and at one instant all my legions
Reuolted from me, and came arm'd against me.
Heere in this paper are the swords predestin'd
For my destruction; heere the fatall stars
That threaten more then ruine; this the deaths head
1760
That does assure me, if she can proue false
That I am mortall, which a sudaine feauer
Would prompt me to beleeue, and fayntly yeeld to.
But now in my full confidence what she suffers,
In that, from any witnesse but my selfe,
1765
I nourish a suspition she's vntrue,
My toughnes returnes to me. Lead on Monsters,
And by the forfeit of your liues confirme
She is all excellence, as you all basenesse,
Or let mankinde for her fall, boldly sweare
1770
There are no chast wiues now, nor euer were.
Exeunt omnes.
ACTVS, IIII. SCAENA, 2.
Enter Domitia, Paris, Seruants.

Domit.
Say we command, that none presume to dare
On forfeit of our fauour, that is life,
Out of a sawcie curiousnesse to stand
Within the distance of their eyes, or eares,
1775
Till we please to be waited on. And sirrha
Exeunt seruants.
Howe're you are excepted, let it not
Beget in you an arrogant opinion
'Tis done to grace you.

Par.
With my humblest seruice
1780
I but obey your summons, and should blush else
To be so neare you.

Domit.
'Twould become you rather
To feare, the greatnesse of the grace vouchsaf'd you
May ouerwhelme you, and 'twill doe no lesse
1785
If when you are rewarded, in your cups
You boast this priuacie.

Par.
That were mightiest Empresse
To play with lightning.

Domit.
You conceiue it right.
1790
The meanes to kill, or saue, is not alone
In Caesar circumscrib'd, for if incens'd
We haue our thunder to, that strikes as deadly.

Par.
'Twould ill become the lownesse of my fortune
To question what you can doe, but withall
1795
Humilitie to attend what is your will,
And then to serue it.

Domit.
And would not a secret
(Suppose we should commit it to your trust)
Scald you to keepe it?

Par.
1800
Though it rag'd within me
Till I turn'd cyndars, it should ne're haue vent.
To be an age a dying, and with torture
Onely to be thought worthy of your counsaile,
Or actuate what you command to me
1805
A wretched obscure thing, not worth your knowledge,
Were a perpetuall happinesse.

Domit.
We could wish
That we could credit thee, and cannot find
In reason but that thou whom oft I haue seene
1810
To personate a Gentleman, noble, wise,
Faithfull, and gainsome, and what vertues else
The Poet pleases to adorne you with
(But that as vessels still pertake the odour
Of the sweete pretious liquors they contain'd)
1815
Thou must be reallie in some degree
The thing thou dost present. Nay doe not tremble,
We seriouslie beleeue it, and presume
Our Paris is the volume in which all
Those excellent guifts the Stage hath seene him grac'd with
1820
Are curiouslie bound vp.

Par.
The argument
Is the same great Augusta, that I acting,
A foole, a coward, a traytor or cold cinique
Or any other weake, and vitious person
1825
Of force I must be such. O gracious Madam,
How glorious soeuer, or deform'd,
I doe appeare in the Sceane, my part being ended,
And all my borrowed ornaments put off,
I am no more, nor lesse then what I was
1830
Before I enter'd.

Domit.
Come you would put on
A wilfull ignorante, and not vnderstand,
What 'tis we point at. Must we in plaine language,
Against the decent modestie of our sex
1835
Say that we loue thee, loue thee to enioy thee,
Or that in our desires thou art preferr'd
And Caesar but thy second? thou in iustice
If from the height of Maiestie we can
(Looke downe vpon thy lownesse and embrace it,)
1840
Art bound with feruor to looke vp to me.

Par.
O Madam heare me with a patient eare
And be but pleas'd to vnderstand the reasons
That doe deterre me from a happinesse
Kings would be riuals for. Can I that owe,
1845
My life, and all that's mine to Caesars bounties
Beyond my hopes, or merits showr'd vpon me,
Make payment for them with ingratitude,
Falshood, and treason? Though you haue a shape
Might tempt Hyppollitus, and larger power
1850
To helpe, or hurt, then wanton Phaedra had,
Let loyaltie, and dutie plead my pardon
Though I refuse to satisfie.

Domit.
You are coy
Expecting I should court you, let meane Ladies
1855
Vse prayers, and intreaties to their creatures
To rise vp instruments to serue their pleasures;
But for Augusta so to loose her selfe
That holds command o're Caesar, and the world,
Were pouertie of spirit. Thou must, thou shalt,
1860
The violence of my passions knowes no meane,
And in my punishments, and my rewards
I'll vse no moderation. Take this onely
As a caution from me. Thread-bare Chastitie,
Is poore in the aduancement of her seruants,
1865
But wantonnesse magnificent; and 'tis frequent
To haue the Salarie of vice waigh downe
The pay of vertue. So without more trifling
Thy sudaine answer.

Par.
In what a straight am I brought in
1870
Alas I know that the denial's death
Nor can my grant discouer'd threaten more.
Yet to dye innocent, and haue the glorie
For all posteritie to report that I
Refus'd an Empresse to preserue my faith
1875
To my great master, in true iudgement must
Show fairer then to buy a guilty life,
With wealth, and honours. 'Tis the base I build on,
I dare not, must not, will not.

Domit.
How contemn'd?
1880
Since hopes, nor feares in the extreames preuaile not
I must vse a meane. Thinke who 'tis sues to thee
Denie not that yet which a brother may
Grant to his sister: as a testimonie
Caesar, Aretinus, Iulia, Domitilla, Caenis aboue.
I am not scorn'd. Kisse me. Kisse me againe.
1885
Kisse closer. Thou art now my Troyan Paris
And I thy Helen.

Par.
Since it is your will.

Caes.
And I am Monelaus. But I shall be
Caesar descends.
Something I know not yet.

Domit.
1890
Why lose we time
And opportunitie. These are but sallads
To sharpen appetite. Let vs to the feast.
Courting Paris wantonly.
Where I shall wish that thou wert Iupiter
And I Alcmena, and that I had power
1895
To lengthen out one short night into three,
And so beget a Hercules.

Caes.
While Amphitrio
Stands by, and drawes the curtaines.

Par.
falls on his face.
Oh? ‚Äî

Domit.
1900
Betrai'd?

Caes.
No, taken in a not of Vulcans filing,
Wherein my selfe the Theater of the Gods
Are sad spectators, not one of em daring
To witnesse with a smile he does desire
1905
To be so sham'd for all the pleasure that
You haue sold your being for. What shall I name thee?
Ingratefull, trecherous, insatiate, all
Inuectiues, which in bitternes of spirit
Wrong'd men haue breath'd out against wicked women,
1910
Cannot expresse thee. Haue I rays'd thee from
Thy lowe condition to the height of greatnesse,
Command, and Maiestie in one base act
To render me (that was before I hugg'd thee)
An adder in my bosome, more then man
1915
A thing beneath a boast? did I force these
Of mine owne bloud as handmaids to kneele to
Thy pompe, and pride, hauing my selfe no thought.
But how with benefits to binde thee mine;
And am I thus rewarded? not a knee?
1920
Nor teare? nor signe of sorrow for thy fault?
Breake stubborne silence. What canst thou alleage
To stay my vengeance?

Domit.
This. Thy lust compell'd me
To be a strumpet, and mine hath return'd it
1925
In my intent, and will, though not in act
To cuckold thee.

Caes.
O impudence I take her hence,
And let her make her entrance into hell.
By leauing life with all the tortures that
1930
Flesh can be sensible of. Yet stay. What power
Her beautie still holds o're my soule that wrongs
Of this vnpardonable nature cannot teach me
To tight my selfe and hate her? - Kill her. - Hold.
O that my dotage should increase from that
1935
Which should breed detestation. By Minerua
If I looke on her longer. I shall melt
And sue to her. My iniuries forgot
Againe to be receiu'd into her fauour
Could honour yeild to it! Carrie her to her Chamber,
1940
Be that her prison till in cooler bloud
I shall determine of her.
Exit with Domitia.

Aret.
Now step I in
While he's in this calme mood for my reward.
Sir, if my seruice hath deseru'd.

Caes.
1945
Yes. Yes,
And I'll reward thee, thou hast rob'd me of
All rest, and peace, and bin the principall meanes
To make me know that, of which if againe
Enter Guard.
I could be ignorant of. I would purchase it
1950
With the losse of Empire; strangle him, take these hence to
And lodge them in the dungeon, could your reason
Dull wretches flatter you with hope to thinke
That this discouerie that hath showr'd vpon me
Perpetuall vexation should not fall
1955
Heauie on you? away with 'em, stop their mouthes
I will heare no reply, O Paris. Paris
Exeunt Guard Aretinus, Iulia, Caenis, Domitilla.
How shall I argue with thee? how begin,
To make thee vnderstand before I kill thee,
With what griefe and vnwillingnes 'tis forc'd from me?
1960
Yet in respect I haue fauourd thee. I will heere
What thou canst speake to qualefie, or excuse
Thy readinesse to serue this womans lust.
And wish thou couldst giue me such satisfaction
As I might burie the remembrance of it:
1965
Looke vp. We stand attentiue;

Par.
O dread Caesar,
To hope for life, or pleade in the defence
Of my ingratitude were againe to wrong you.
I know I haue deseru'd death. And my suit is
1970
That you would hasten it: yet that your highnes
When I am dead (as sure I will not liue)
May pardon me I'll onely vrge my frailtie,
Her will, and the temptation of that beautie
Which you could not resist. How would poore I then
1975
Fly that which followd me, and Caesar su'd for?
This is all. And now your sentence.

Caes.
Which I know not
How to pronounce, O that thy fault had bin
But such as I might pardon; if thou hadst
1980
In wantonnesse (like Nero) sir'd proud Rome
Betraide an armie, butcherd the whole Senate,
Committed Sacriledge, or any crime
The iustice of our Roman lawes cals death,
I had preuented any intercession
1985
And freely sign'd thy pardon.

Par.
But for this
Alas you cannot nay you must not Sir
Nor let it to posteritie be recorded
That Caesar vnreueng'd, sufferd a wrong,
1990
Which if a priuate man should sit downe with it
Cowards would baffell him.

Caes.
With such true feeling
Thou arguest against thy selfe, that it
Workes more vpon me, then if my Minerua
1995
(The grand protectresse of my life, and Empire,)
On forfeite of her fauour, cry'd aloud
Caesar show mercie. And I know not how
I am inclinde to it. Rise. I'll promise nothing,
Yet cleare thy cloudie feares and cherish hopes,
2000
What we must doe, we shall doe; we remember
A Tragedie, we oft haue seen with pleasure,
Call'd, the False Seruant.

Par.
Such a one we haue Sir.

Caes.
In which a great Lord takes to his protection
2005
A man forlorne, giuing him ample power
To order, and dispose of his estate
In his absence, he pretending then a iourney.
But yet with this restraint that on no tearmes
This Lord suspecting his wiues constancie
2010
(She hauing playd false to a former husband)
The seruant though sollicited should consent
Though she commanded him to quench her flames.

Par.
That was indeed the argument.

Caes.
And what
2015
Didst thou play in it?

Par.
The false seruant Sir.

Caes.
Thou didst indeed. Do the Players waite without?

Par.
They doe Sir and prepar'd to act the storie
Your Maiestie mention'd.

Caes.
2020
Call 'em in. Who presents
The iniur'd Lord?
Enter AEsopus, Latinus, a Boy drest for a Ladie.

AEsop.
T'is my part Sir,

Caes.
Thou didst not
Doe it to the life. We can performe it better.
2025
Off with my Robe, and wreath, since Nero scorn'd not
The publike Theater, we in priuate may
Disport our selues. This cloake, and hat without
Wearing a beard, or other propertie
Will fit the person.

AEsop.
2030
Onely Sir a foyle
The point, and edge rebutted, when you act
To doe the murther. If you please to vse this
And lay aside your owne sword.

Caes.
By no meanes.
2035
In iest nor earnest this parts neuer from me.
We'l haue but one short Sceane. That where the Ladie
In an imperious way commands the seruant
To be vnthankefull to his patron when
My cue's to enter prompt me nay begin
2040
And doe it spritely though but a new Actor,
When I come to execution you shall find
No cause to laugh at me.

Lat.
In the name of wonder
What's Caesars purpose?

AEsop.
2045
There is no contending.

Caes.
Why when?

Par.
I am arm'd.
And stood grim death now within my view and his
Vneuitable dart aim'd at my breast
2050
His cold embraces should not bring an ague
To any of my faculties, till his pleasures
Were seru'd, and satisfied, which done Nestors yeeres,
To me would be vnwelcome.

Boy.
Must we intreate,
2055
That were borne to command, or court a seruant
(That owes his foode and cloathing to our bountie)
For that, which thou ambitiouslie shouldst kneele for?
Vrge not in thy excuse the fauours of
Thy absent Lord, or that thou standst ingag'd
2060
For thy life to his Charitie; nor thy feares
Of what may follow, it being in my power
To mould him any way.

Par.
As you may me
In what his reputation is not wounded
2065
Nor I his creature in my thankefulnesse suffer.
I know you are young, and faire, be vertuous too
And loyall to his bed, that hath aduanc'd you
To th'height of happinesse.

Boy.
Can my louesicke heart
2070
Be cur'd with counsell? or durst reason euer
Offer to put in an exploded plea
In the Court of Venus. My desires admit not
The least delay. And therefore instantly
Giue me to vnderstand what I shall trust to.
2075
For if I am refus'd, and not enioy
Those rauishing pleasures from thee, I run mad for;
I'll sweare vnto my Lord at his returne
(Making what I deliuer good with teares)
That brutishly thou wouldst haue forc'd from me
2080
What I make suit for. And then but imagine
What 'tis to dye with these words slaue, and traytor,
With burning corrasiues writ vpon thy forehead,
And liue prepar'd fort.

Par.
This he will beleeue
2085
Vpon her information. 'Tis apparent
And then I am nothing. And of two extreames
Wisedome sayes chose the lesse. Rather then fall
Vnder your indignation, I will yeeld
This kisse, and this confirmes it.

AEsop.
2090
Now. Sir now.

Caes.
I must take them at it.

AEsop.
Yes Sir, be but perfect.

Caes.
O villaine! thankelesse villaine! I should talke now;
But I haue forgot my part. But I can doe,
2095
Thus, thus, and thus.
Kils Paris.

Par.
Oh, I am slaine in earnest.

Caes.
'Tis time, and 'twas my purpose my good Paris
And yet before life leaue thee, let the honour
I haue done thee in thy death bring comfort to thee
2100
If it had beene within the power of Caesar
His dignitie preseru'd he had pardon'd thee.
But crueltie of honour did deny it.
Yet to confirme I lou'd thee? 'twas my study
To make thy end more glorious to distinguish
2105
My Paris from all others, and in that
Haue showne my pittie. Nor would I let thee fall
By a Centurions sword, or haue thy limbes
Rent peece meale by the hangmans hooke howeuer
Thy crime deseru'd it: but as thou didst liue
2110
Romes brauest Actor, 'twas my plot that thou
Shouldst dye in action, and to crowne it dye
With an applause induring to all times,
By our imperiall hand. His soule is freed
From the prison of his flesh, let it mount vpward.
2115
And for this truncke when that the funerall pile
Hath made it ashes, we'l see it inclos'd
In a golden vrne. Poets adorne his hearse
With their most rauishing sorrowes, and the stage
For euer mourne him, and all such as were
2120
His glad spectators weepe his suddaine death,
The cause forgotten in his Epitaph.
Exeunt. A sad musicke the Players bearing off Paris body, Caesar and the rest following.
The end of the fourth Act.

ACTVS, V. SCAENA, 1.
Enter Parthenius, Stephanos, Guard.

Parth.
Keepe a strong guard vpon him, and admit not
Accesse to any, to exchange a word,
Or syllable with him, till the Emperour pleases
2125
To call him to his presence. The relation
That you haue made me Stephanos of these late
Strange passions in Caesar, much amaze me.
The informer Aretinus put to death
For yeelding him a true discouerie
2130
Of th'Empresse wantonnesse; poore Paris kild first
And now lamented; and the Princesses
Consin'd to seuerall Islands, yet Augusta
The machine on which all this mischiefe mou'd
Receiu'd againe to grace?

Steph.
2135
Nay courted to it.
(Such is the impotence of his affection)
Yet, to conceale his weaknesse he giues out
The people made suit for her, whom they hate more
Then ciuill warre, or famine. But take heed
2140
My Lord, that nor in your consent nor wishes
You lent or furtherance, or fauour to
The plot contriu'd against her, should she proue it,
Nay doubt it onely you are a loft man
Her power o're doting Caesar being now
2145
Greater then euer.

Parth.
'Tis a truth I shake at.
And when there's opportunitie.

Steph.
Say but doe
I am yours, and sure.

Parth.
2150
I will Stand one tryall more
And then you shall heare from me.

Steph.
Now obserue
The fondnesse of this tyranne, and her pride.
Enter Caesar and Domitia.

Caes.
Nay all's forgotten.

Domit.
2155
It may be on your part.

Caes.
Forgiuen to Domitia 'tis a fauour
That you should welcome with more cheerefull lookes
Can Caesar pardon what you durst not hope for
That did the iniurie, and yet must sue
2160
To her whose guilt is wash'd off by his mercy
Onely to entertaine it?

Domit.
I ask'd none,
And I should be more wretched to receiue
Remission (for what I hold no crime)
2165
But by a bare acknowledgement then if
By sleighting, and contemning it, as now
I dat'd thy vtmost furie. Though thy flatterers
Perswade thee, that thy murthers, lusts, and rapes
Are vertues in thee, and what pleases Caesar
2170
Though neuer sown iust is right, and lawfull;
Or worke in thee a false beliefe that thou
Art more then mortall, yet I to thy teeth
(When circl'd with thy Guards, thy rods, thy axes,
And all the ensignes of thy boasted power)
2175
Will say Domitian, nay adde to it Caesar
Is a weake feeble man, a bondman to
His violent passions, and in that my slaue,
Nay more my slaue, then my affections made me
To my lou'd Paris.

Caes.
2180
Can I liue, and heare this?
Or heare and not reuenge it? come, you know
The strength that you hold on me, doe not vse it
VVith too much crueltie, for though 'tis granted
That Lidian Omphale had lesse command
2185
O're Hercules, then you vsurpe ore me,
Reason may teach me to shake off the yoke
Of my fond dotage.

Domit.
Neuer, doe not hope it
It cannot be. Thou bring my beauties captiue
2190
And not to be redeem'd, my Empire's larger
Then thine Domitian, which I'll exercise
VVith rigor on thee, for my Paris death.
And when I haue forc'd those eyes now red with fury
To drop downe teares, in vaine spent to appease me
2195
I know thy seruor such to my embraces
(Which shall be, though still kneel'd for, stil deni'd thee)
That thou with languishment shalt wish my Actor
Did liue againe, so thou might'st be his second
To feede vpon those delicates, when he's sated.

Caes.
2200
O my Minerua

Domit.
There she is inuoke her
Shee cannot arme thee with abilitie
To draw thy sword on me, my power being greater
Or onely say to thy Centurions
2205
Dare none of you doe what I shake to thinke on?
And in this womans death remoue the furies
That euery houre afflict mee? Lamias wrongs
When thy lust forc'd mee from him, are in mee
At the height reveng'd, nor would I out-liue Paris
2210
But that thy loue increasing with my hate
May adde vnto thy torments, so withall
Contempt I can I leaue thee.
Exit Domitia.

Caes.
I am lost
Nor am I Caesar, when I first betray'd
2215
The freedome of my faculties, and will
To this imperious Siren, I layd downe
The Empire of the world, and of my selfe
At her proud feete. Sleepe all my irefull powers?
Or is the magique of my dotage such
2220
That I must still make suite to heare those charmes
That doe increase my thraldome? wake my anger,
For shame breake through this Lethargie, and appeare
With vsuall terror, and enable mee
(Since I weare not a sword to pierce her heart,
2225
Nor haue a tongue to say this let her dye)
Though 'tis done with a feauer-shaken hand
Pulls out a Table booke.
To signe her death, assist mee great Minerua
And vindicate thy votarie. So shee's now
Among the list of those I haue prescrib'd
2230
And are to free mee of my doubts, and feares,
To dye to morrow.
(Writes.)

Steph.
That same fatall booke
Was neuer drawne yet, but some men of rancke
Were mark'd out for destruction.

Parth.
2235
I begin
To doubt my selfe.

Caes.
Who waites there?

Parth.
Caesar.

Caes.
So.
2240
These that command arm'd troupes quake, at my frownes
And yet a woman sleights 'em. Where's the Wizard
Wee charg'd you to fetch in?

Parth.
Readie to suffer
What death you please t'appoint him.

Caes.
2245
Bring him in.
Enter Ascletario, Tribunes, Guard.
We'll question him our selfe. Now you that hold
Intelligence with the starres, and dare prefixe
The day and houre in which we are to part
With life and Empire, punctually fore-telling
2250
The meanes, and manner of our violent end,
As you would purchase credit to your art
Resolue me since you are assur'd of vs
What fate attends your selfe?

Asclet.
I haue had long since
2255
A certaine knowledge, and assure as thou
Shalt dye to morrow being the fourteenth of
The Kalenda of October, the houre fiue
Spite of preuention, this carkasse shall be
Torne and deuourd by dogs, and let that stand for a firme prediction.

Caes.
2260
May our body wretch
Find neuer nobler Sepulcher if this
Fall euer on thee. Are we the great disposer
Of life, and death yet cannot mocke the starres
In such a trifle? Hence with the impostor,
2265
And hauing cut his throat, erect a pile
Guarded with souldiers, till his cursed truncke
Be turn'd to ashes, vpon forfeite of
Your life, and theirs, performe it.

Asclet.
'Tis in vaine,
2270
When what I haue foretold is made apparent
Tremble to thinke what followes.

Caes.
Drag him hence
The Guard beare off Ascletario.
And doe as I command you. I was neuer
Fuller of confidence, for hauing got
2275
The victorie of my passions, in my freedome
From proud Domitia (who shall cease to liue
Since she disdaines to loue) I rest vnmou'd
And in defiance of prodigious meteors,
Chaldeans vaine predictions, iealous feares
2280
Of my neere friends, and freemen, certaine hate
O kindred, and alliance, or all terrors
The souldiers doubted faith, or peoples rage
Can bring to shake my constancie I am arm'd.
That scrupulous thing still'd Conscience is sear'd vp
2285
And I insensible of all my actions
For which by morrall and religious fooles
I stand condemn'd, as they had neuer beene
And since I haue subdu'd triumphant loue
I will not deifie pale captiue scare
2290
Nor in a thought receiue it. For till thou
Wisest Minerua that from my first youth,
Hast beene my sole protectresse, dost forsake me
Not Iunius Rusticus, threatned apparition,
Nor what this Southsayer but eu'n now foretold
2295
(Being things impossible to humane reason)
Shall in a dreame disturbe me. Bring my couch there
Enter with couch.
A sudaine but a secure drousinesse
Inuites me to repose my selfe. Let Musicke
With some choyse dittie second it. I the meane time
2300
Rest there deare booke, which open'd when I wake
Layes the booke vnder his Pillow, The Musicke and song. Caesar sleepes.
Enter Parthenius and Domitia.

Domit.
Write my name
In his bloudie scrole Parthenius? the feare's idle
He durst not, could not.

Parth.
I can assure nothing
2305
But I obseru'd when you departed from him
After some little passion, but much furie,
He drew it out, whose death he sign'd I know not
But in his lookes appear'd a resolution
Of what before he staggerd at. What he hath
2310
Determin'd of is vncertaine, but too soone
Will fall on you, or me, or both, or any
His pleasure knowne to the Tribunes, and Centurions.
Who neuer vse to enquire his will but serue it.
Now if out of the confidence of your power,
2315
The bloudie Catalogue being still about him
As he sleepes you dare peruse it, or remoue it
You may instruct your selfe or what to suffer,
Or how to crosse it.

Domit.
I would not be caught
2320
With too much confidence. By your leaue Sir. Ha!
No motion! you lye vneasie Sir,
Let me mend your Pillow.

Parth.
Haue you it?

Domit.
'Tis heere.

Caes
2325
Oh.

Parth.
You haue wak'd him, softly gracious Madam
While we are vnknowne, and then consult at leisure.
Exeunt Parthenius, and Domitia.
A dreadfull Musicke sounding, Enter Iunius Rusticus, and Palphurius Sura, with bloudie swords, they waue them ouer his head. Caesar in his sleepe troubled, seemes to pray to the Image, they scornefully take it away.
Defend me goddesse, or this horrid dreame
Will force me to destraction. Whether haue
2330
These furies borne thee? Let me rise! and follow
I am bath'd o're with the cold sweat of death,
And am depriu'd of organs to pursue
These sacriligious spirits. Am I at once
Robd of my hopes, and being? No, I liue
Rises distractedly.
2335
Yes liue, and haue discourse to know my selfe
Of Gods, and men forsaken. What accuser
Within me cries aloud, I haue deseru'd it,
It being iust to neither. Who dares speake this?
Am I not Caesar? how I againe repeate it?
2340
Presumptuous traytor thou shalt dye, what traytor?
He that hath beene a traytor to himselfe
And stands conuicted heere. Yet who can sit
A competent Iudge ore Caesar? Caesar. Yes
Caesar by Caesar's, sentenced and must suffer
2345
Minerua cannot saue him. Ha! Where is she?
Where is my goddesse? vanish'd! I am lost then
No 'twas no dreame, but a most reall truth
That Iunius Rusticus, and Palphurius Sura,
Although their ashes were cast in the sea
2350
Wereby their innocence made vp againe.
And in corporeall formes but now appear'd.
Wauing their bloudie swordes aboue my head,
As at their deathes they threatned. And me thought
Minerua rauish'd hence whisper'd that she
2355
Was for my blasphemies disarm'd by Ioue
And could no more protect me. Yes 'twas so,
His thunder does confirme it, against which
thunder and lightning.
Howe're it spare the lawrell, this proud wreath
Is no assurance. Ha! come you resolu'd
Enter 3Tribunes.
2360
To be my executioners?

1Trib.
Allegiance
And faith forbid that we should lift an arme
Against your sacred head.

2Trib.
We rather sue
2365
For mercie.

3Trib.
And acknowledge that in iustice
Our liues are forfeited for not performing
What Caesar charg'd vs.

1Trib.
Nor did we transgresse it
2370
In our want of will, or care, for being but men
It could not be in vs to make resistance,
The Gods fighting against vs.

Caes.
Speake in what
Did they expresse their anger? wee will heere it
2375
But dare not say vndaunted.

1Trib.
In briefe thus Sir.
The Sentence giuen by your imperiall tongue
For the Astrologer Ascletario's death
With speede was put in execution.

Caes.
2380
Well.

1Trib.
For his throate out, his legs bound, and his armes
Pinion'd behinde his backe, the breathlesse truncke
Was with all scorne dragg'd to the field of Mars
And there a pile being rais'd of old dry wood,
2385
Smeer'd o're with oyle, and brimstone, or what else
Could helpe to feede, or to increase the fire
The Carkasse was throwne on it; but no sooner
The stuffe, that was most apt, began to flame;
But sudainely to the amazement of
2390
The fearelesse souldier, a sudaine flash
Of lightning breaking through the scatter'd cloudes
With such a horrid violence forc'd its passage
And as disdaining all heate but it selfe
In a moment quench'd the artificiall fire.
2395
And before we could kindle it againe
A clap of thunder follow'd with such noyse,
As if then Ioue incens'd against mankind,
Had in his secret purposes determin'd
An vniuersall ruine to the world.
2400
This horror past, not at Deucalions floud
Such a stormie shower of raine (and yet that word is
To narrow to expresse it) was e're seene
Imagine rather Sir, that with lesse furie
The Waues rush downe the Cataracts of Nile;
2405
Or that the Sea spouted into the ayre
By the angry Orke, endaungering tall ships
But sayling neere it, so falls downe againe,
Yet heere the wonder ends not, but begins
For as in vaine we labour'd to consume
2410
The witches bodye, all the Dogs of Rome
Howling, and yelling like to famish'd wolues
Brake in vpon vs, and though thousands were
Kild in th'attempt some did ascend the pile
And with their eager fangs ceas'd on the carkasse.

Caes.
2415
But haue they torne it?

1Trib.
Torne it, and deuour'd it.

Caes.
I then am a dead man since all predictions
Assure me I am lost; O my lou'd souldiers
Your Emperour must leaue you: yet howeuer
2420
I cannot grant my selfe a short reprieue
I freely pardon you. The fatall houre
Steales fast vpon me. I must dye this morning
By fiue my souldiers, that's the latest houre
You e're must see me liuing.

1Trib.
2425
Ioue auert it
In our swords lies your fate, and we will guard it.

Caes.
O no, it cannot be, it is decreed,
Aboue, and by no strengths heere to be alterd.
Let proud mortalitie but looke on Caesar
2430
Compass'd of late with armies, in his eyes
Carrying both life, and death, and in his armes
Fadoming the earth; that would be stilde a God,
And is for that presumption cast beneath
The low condition of a common man,
2435
Sincking with mine owne waight,

1Trib.
Doe not forsake,
Your selfe wee'll neuer leaue you.

2Trib.
VVe'll draw vp
More cohorts of your Guard, if you doubt treason.

Caes.
2440
They cannot saue me. The offended Gods
That now sit iudges on me, from their enuie
Of my power and greatnesse heere, conspire against me.

1Trib.
Endeauour to appease them.

Caes.
'Twill be fruitlesse
2445
I am past hope of remission. Yet could I
Decline this dreadfull houre of fiue, these terrors
That driue me to despaire would soone flye from me
And could you but till then assure me,

1Trib.
Yes Sir,
2450
Or wee'll fall with you, and make Rome the urne
In which wee'll mix our ashes.

Caes.
Tis said noblie,
I am something comforted. Howere to dye
Is the full period of calamitie.
Exeunt.
ACTVS, V. SCAENA, 2.
Enter Parthenius, Domitia, Iulia, Caenis Domitilla, Stephanos, Sijeius, Entellus.

Parth.
2455
You see we are all condemnd, there's no euasion,
We must doe or suffer.

Steph.
But it must be sudaine
The least delay is mortall.

Domit.
Would I were
2460
A man to giue it action.

Domit:
Could I make my approaches though my stature
Does promise little, I haue a spirit as daring
As hers, that can reach higher.

Steph.
I will take
2465
That burthen from you Madam. All the art is
To draw him from the Tribunes that attend him
For could you bring him but within my swords reach
The world should owe her freedome from a tyranne,
To Stephanos.

Sige.
2470
You shall not share alone
The glorie of a deed that will endure
To all posteritie.

Entel.
I will put in
For a part my selfe.

Parth.
2475
Be resolute, and stand close.
I haue conceiu'd a way, and with the hazard
Of my life I'll practise it to fetch him hither.
But then no trifling.

Steph.
We'l despatch him feare not
2480
A dead dog neuer bites.

Parth.
Thus then at all
Parthenius goes off the rest stand aside
Enter Caesar and the Tribunes.

Caes.
How slowe pac'd are these minutes! in extreames
How miserable is the least delay
Could I iumpe feathers to the wings of time
2485
Or with as little ease command the Sunne
To scourge his coursers vp heauens easterne hill
Making the houre I tremble at past recalling
As I can moue this dyals tongue to six,
My veines, and arteries emptied with feare
2490
Would fill and swell againe. How doe I looke?
Doe you yet see death about me:

1Trib.
Thinke not of him
There is no danger all these prodegies
That doe affright you rise from naturall causes,
2495
And though you doe ascribe them to your selfe,
Had you ne're beene, had happen'd

Caes.
'Tis well said,
Exceeding well braue souldier. Can it be
That I that feele my selfe in health and strength
2500
Should still belieue I am so neare my end,
And haue my guards about me? perish all
Predictions. I grow constant they are false
And built vpon vncertainties.

1Trib.
This is right.
2505
Now Caesar's hard like Caesar.

Caes.
We will to
The Campe, and hauing there confirmd the souldier
With a large Donatiue, and increase of pay
Some shall. I say no more.
Enter Parthenius.

Parth.
2510
All happinesse
Securitie, long life attend vpon
The Monarch of the World.

Caes.
Thy lookes are cheerefull,

Parth.
And my relation full of ioy and wonder.
2515
Why is the care of your imperiall body
My Lord neglected the fear'd houre being past
In which your your life was threatned.

Caes.
Is't past fiue?

Parth.
Past six vpon my knowledge, and iniustice
2520
Your Clocke master should dye that hath deferd
Your peace so long. There is a post new lighted
That brings assur'd intelligence, that your legions
In Siria haue wonne a glorious day,
And much enlarg'd your Empire. I haue kept him
2525
Conceal'd that you might first pertake the pleasure
In priuate, and the Senate from your selfe
Be taught to vnderstand how much they owe
To you and to your fortune.

Caes.
Hence pale feare then
2530
Lead me Parthenius.

1Trib.
Shall we waite you?

Caes.
No
After losses Guards are vsefull, know your distance.
Exeunt Caesar and Parthenius.

2Trib.
How strangely hopes delude men, as I liue
2535
The houre is not yet come.

1Trib.
Howere we are
To pay our duties, and obserue the sequele.
Exeunt Trib.
Enter Caesar, and Parthenius.

Domit.
I heare him comming, be constant.

Caes.
Where Parthenius is this glad messenger.

Steph.
2540
Make the doore fast. Heere, a messenger of horror.

Caes.
How! betraid?

Domit.
No taken tyranne.

Caes.
My Domitia in the conspiracie!

Parth.
Behold this booke.

Caes.
2545
Nay then I am lost. Yet though I am vnarm'd
I'll not fall poorely.
Orethrowes Stephanos.

Steph.
Helpe me.

Entel.
Thus, and thus.

Sije.
Are you so long a falling?

Caes.
2550
falls, and dyes.
'Tis done, 'tis done basely.

Parth.
This for my Fathers death.

Domit.
This for my Paris,

Iul,
This for thy Incest
These seuerally stab him.

Domit
This for thy abuse of Domitilla.
Enter Tribunes.

1Trib.
2555
Force the doores. O Mars!
What haue you done.

Parth.
What Rome shall giue vs thanks for.

Steph.
Despatch'd a Monster.

1Trib.
Yet he was our Prince
2560
How euer wicked, aud in you this murther
Which whosoe're succeeds him will reuenge,
Nor will we that seru'd vnder his command
Consent that such a monster as thy selfe
(For in thy wickednesse, Augusta's title
2565
Hath quite forsooke thee) thou that wert the ground
Of all these mischiefes, shall goe hence vnpunish'd.
Lay hands on her. And drag her to sentence,
We will referre the hearing to the Senate
Who may at their best leisure censure you
2570
Take vp his body. He in death hath payd
For all his cruelties. Heere's the difference
Good Kings are mourn'd for after life, but ill
And such as gouern'd onely by their will
And not their reason. Vnlamented fall
2575
No Goodmans teare shed at their Funerall.
Exeunt omnes.
Florish.
FINIS.
