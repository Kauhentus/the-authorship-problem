A mad VVorld, my Masters.
Enter Dick Folly-wit, and his consorts, Lieftenant Mawe-worme, Antient Hoboy, and others his Comrades.
Lieft.
Captaine, Regent, Principall,

Anti.
What shall I call thee?
The Noble sparke of bounty;
The life-bloud of Society.
Folly-w.
Call mee your Forecast, you whore∣sons, when you come drunk out of a Ta∣uerne, t'is I must cast your plots into forme stil; tis I must ma∣nage the Pranck, or Ile not giue a louse for the proceeding: I must let flie my ciuil fortunes, turne wilde-braine, lay my wits vpo'th Tenters, you raskals, to maintaine a company of vil∣laines, whom I loue in my very soule and conscience.

Lieft.
A ha, our little forecast.

Folly-w.
Hang you, you haue bewitcht me among you, I was as well giuen till I fell to be wicked, my Grandsire had hope of me, I went all in blacke, swore but a Sundaies, neuer came home drunke, but vpon fasting nights to clense my sto∣macke; sl'id now I'me quite altered, blowne into light co∣lours, let out othes by'th minute, sit vp late till it bee early, drinke drunke till I am sober, sincke downe dead in a Ta∣uerne, and rise in a Tabacco-shop: her's a transformation: I was wont yet to pitie the simple, and leaue e'm some money: sl'id, now I gull e'm without conscience; I goe without order, sweare without number, gull without mercie, & drinke without measure.

Lieft.
I deny the last, for if you drinke nere so much, you drinke within measure.

Folly-w
How proue you that sir?

Lieft.
Because the drawers neuer fill their pots.

Folly-w
Masle that was well found out all drunkerds may lawfully say, they drinke within measure by that tricke, dna now I'me put i'th mind of a tricke can you keepe your coun∣tenance villaines? yet I am a foole to aske that, for how can they keepe their countenance that haue lost their credits?

Ants.
I warrant you for blushing Captaine.

Folly-w.
I easily beleeue that Antient, for thou lost thy co∣lours once; Nay faith as for blushing, I thinke ther's grace little enough amongst you all, tis lent in your cheekes, the flag's downe; wel, your blushing face I suspect not, nor in∣deed greatly your laughing-face, vnlesse you had more mo∣ney in your purses: then thus compendiously now, you all know the possibilities of my hereafter fortunes, and the humor of my frolike Grandsire Sir Bounteous Progresse; whose death makes all possible to me: I shall haue all, when he ha's nothing; but now he ha's all, I shall haue nothing: I thinke one minde runnes through a million of e'm; they loue to keepe vs sober all the while the're aliue, that when the're dead we may drinke to their healths; they cannot a∣bide to see vs merry all the while the're aboue ground; and that makes so many laugh at their fathers funerals: I know my Grandsire has his Will in a Boxe, and has bequeath'd all to me, when he can carry nothing away; but stood I in neede of poore tenne pounds now, by his will I should hang my selte e're I should get it, ther's no such word in his Will I war∣rant you, nor no such thought in his mind.

Lieft.
You may build vpon that Captaine.

Folly w.
Then since hee ha's no will to doe me good as long as he liues; by mine owne will, Ile doe my selfe good before he dies, and now I arriue at the purpose. You are not ignorant I'me sure, you true and necessary implements of mischiefe; first, that my Grandsier Sir Bounteous Progresse is a Knight of thousands, and therefore no Knight since one

description
Page [unnumbered]
thousand sixe hundred: next, that he keepes a house like his name Bounteous, open for all commers: thirdly and lastly, that hee stands much vpon the glory of his complement, variety of entertainement, together with the largenes of his Kitchin, longitude of his Buttery, and fecunditie of his Larder, and thinkes himselfe neuer happier then when some stiffe L. or great Countesse alights, to make light his dishes: these being well mixt together may giue my proiect better encourage∣ment, and make my purpose spring forth more fortunate: to be short, and cut off a great deale of durty way; Ile downe to my Grandsire like a L.

Lieft.
How Captaine?

Folly-w.
A French ruffe, a thinne beard, and a strong per∣fume will doo't: I can hire blew coats for you all by West∣minster clocke, and that colour will be soonest beleeued.

Lieft.
But prethee Captaine?

Folly.
Push, I reach past your fadomes; you desire crowns.

Lieft.
From the crowne of our head, to the sole of our foot bully.

Folly-w.
Why carry your selues but probably, and carry away enough with your selues.

Enter M. Penitent Brothel.

Exit
Heer's a mad braine a'th first, whose prankes scorne to haue presidents; to be second to any; or walke beneath any: mad∣caps inuentions, has plaid more trickes then the cardes can allow a man, and of the last stampe too, hating imitation, a fellow, whose onely glory is to be prime of the company; to be sure of which, he maintaines all the rest: hee's the Karion, and they the Kytes that gorge vpon him.

But why in others doe I checke wilde passions,
And retaine deadly follies in my selfe?
I taxe his youth of common receiu'd riot,
Times Comicke flashes, and the fruits of blood;
description
Page [unnumbered]
And in my selfe sooth vp adulterous motions,
And such an appetite that I know dams me,
Yet willingly embrace it, loue to Harebraines wife,
Ouer whose howers and pleasures her sicke husband
With a fantasticke but deserud suspect,
Bestowes his serious time in watch and ward;
And therefore I'me constraind to vse the meanes
Of one that knowes no meane, a Curtizan,
One poyson for another, whom her husband
Without suspition innocently admits
Into her company, who with tried art
Corrupts and loosens her most constant powers,
Making his ielousy more then halfe a wittoll,
Before his face plotting his owne abuse,
To which himselfe giues ayme.
Enter Curtizan.
Whilst the broad arrowe with the forked head
Misses his browe but narrowly; see here she comes,
The close Curtizan, whose mother is her bawde.
Curtiz.
Master Penitent Brothell.

M.Pen.
My litle prety Lady gull-man, the newes, the comfort?

Curtiz.
Y'are the fortunate man sir, Knight a'th holland skirt: there wants but opportunitie and shee's waxe of your owne fashioning, she had wrought her selfe into the forme of your loue before my art set finger to her.

M. Pen.
Did our affections meete? our thoughts keepe time?

Curtiz.
So it should seeme by the musicke, the onely iarre is in the grumbling base violl her husband.

M. Pen.
Oh his waking suspition!

Curtiz.
Sigh not M. Penitent, trust the managing of the bu∣sines with me, tis for my credite now to see't well finish't: if I do you no good sir, you shall giue me no money sir.

M. Pen.
I am arriu'd at the Court of conscience; A Curti∣zan! O admirable times! honestie is remoued to the Com∣mon place. Farewell Lady.

Exit. Penitent.
Enter mother.

Moth.
How now daughter?

Curtiz,
What newes mother?

Moth.
A token from thy keeper.

Curtiz.
Oh from sir Bounteous Progresse: hee's my kee∣per in deed, but ther's many a peece of venison stolne that my keeper wots not on; theres no parke kept so warily, but loo∣ses flesh one time or other; and no woman kept so priuately, but may watch aduantage to make the best of her pleasure: and in common reason one keeper cannot be enough for so proud a parke as a woman.

Moth.
Hold thee there girle.

Curt.
Feare not me mother.

Moth.
Euery part of the world shootes vp daily into more subtilty: the very spider weaues her caules with more art and cunning, to entrap the flie.

The shallow ploughman can distinguish now,
Twixt simple truth and a dissembling browe.
Your base mechanick fellow can spy out
A weakenes in a L. and learnes to floute.
How do'st behooue vs then that liue by sleight,
To haue our wits wound vp to their stretcht height?
Fifteene times thou knowst I haue sold thy may denhead,
To make vp a dowry for thy mariage, and yet
Theres may denhead enough for olde sir Bounteous stil,
Heele be all his life time about it yet, and bee as far to seeke when he has done.
The summes that I haue told vpon thy pillow!
I shall once see those golden daies agen:
Tho fifteene, all thy may den heads are not gone:
The Italian is not serude yet, nor the French:
The British men come for a dozen at once,
They ingrosse all the market, Tut my girle,
Tis nothing but a politicke conueyance;
A sincere carriage, a religious eyebrowe
That throwes their charmes ouer the worldlings senses;
And when thou spiest a foole that truely pities
The false springs of thine eyes,
description
Page [unnumbered]
And honorably doates vpon thy loue,
If he be rich, set him by for a husband;
Be wisely tempered and learne this my wench
Who gets th' opinion for a vertuous name
May sin at pleasure, and nere thinke of shame:
Curtiz.
Mother I am too deepe a Scholler growne To learne my first rules now.

T'will be thy owne, I say no more; peace, harke, remoue thy selfe, oh, the two elder Brothers.

Good morrow gentlemen, Master Inesse, and M. Possibilitie.

Wher's the litle sweete Lady your daughter?

Moth.
Euen at her booke sir.

Poss.
So religious?

Moth.
Tis no new motion sir, sh'as tooke it from an in∣fant.

Poss.
May we deserue a sight of her, Lady?

Moth.
Vpon that condition you will promise me gentle∣men, to auoid all prophane talke, wanton complements, vn∣decent phrazes, and lasciuious courtings▪ (which I knowe my daughter will sooner die then endure,) I am contented your suits shalbe granted.

Poss.
Not a bawdy sillable I protest.

Sillable was plac'st there, for indeed your one silla∣bles are your bawdiest words, pricke that downe.

Hareb.
Welcome my friends, I must deserue your dili∣gence in an imployment serious: the troth is, there is a cun∣ning plot laid, but happily discouered, to robbe my house: the night vncertaine when, but fixt within the circle of this month: nor do's this villany consist in numbers:

Or many partners, onely some one
Shall in the forme of my familiar friend,
Be receiude priuately into my house,
By some perfidious seruant of mine owne,
Addrest fit for the practise.
First.
O abominable!

Hareb.
If you be faithfull watchmen, shew your goodnes, And with these Angels shoare vp your eye-lids: Let me not be purloind, purloind indeed; the merry Greekes conceiue me: there is a Iem I would not loose, Kept by the Italian vnder locke and key: we English men are carelesse creatures: well, I haue said enough.

Second.
And we wil do enough sir.

Exeunt.
Hareb.
Why wel said, watch me a good turne now, so, so, so,
Rise villany with the Larke, why tis preuented,
Or steal't by with the leather winged Bat:
The euening cannot saue it, peace; Oh Lady Gulman, my wifes onely company! welcome; and how do's the vertuous Matron, that good old Gentlewoman thy mother? I per∣swade my selfe, if modesty be in the world she has part on't: a woman of an excellent carriage all her life time, in Court, Ci∣tie, and Countrey.

Curtiz.
Sha's alwaies carried it well in those places sir; witnesse three bastards a piece: how do's your sweete bed∣fellow sir? you see I'me her boldest visitant.

Hareb.
And welcome sweete Virgin, the onely compani∣on, my soule wishes for her; I left her within at her Lute, pre∣thee giue her good counsell.

Curtiz.
Alas, she needes none sir.

Hareb.
Yet, yet, yet, a little of thy instructions will not come amisse to her.

Curtiz.
Ile bestow my labour sir.

Curt.
Sha's set vp her resolution alreadie sir.

Hareb.
True, true, and this will confirme it the more, ther's a chapter of Hell, tis good to reade this cold weather, terrifie her, terrifie her; goe, reade to her the horrible pun∣ishments for itching wantonnes, the paines alotted for adul∣terie; tell her her thoughts, her very dreames are answerable, say so; rip vp the life of a Curtiza, & shew how loath som tis.

Curt.
The gentleman would perswade mee in time to dis∣grace my selfe, and speake ill of mine owne function.

Exit.
Hareb.
This is the course I take, Ile teach the married man
A new selected straine, I admit none
But this pure virgin to her company,
Puh, that's enough; Ile keepe her to her stint,
Ile put her to her pension,
She gets but her allowance, thats bare-one,
Few women but haue that beside theire owne,
Ha, ha, ha, nay Ile put her hard toote.
Enter wife & Curt.
Wife
Faine would I meete the gentleman.

Curt.
Push, faine would you meete him, why, you doe not take the course.

Hareb.
How earnestly shee labours her, like a good hol∣some sister of the familie, she wil preuaile I hope.

Curt.
Is that the meanes?

Wife
What is the meanes? I would as gladly to inioy his sight, imbrace it as the—

Curt.
Shall I haue hearing? listen?

Hareb.
She's round with her yfaith.

Curt.
When husbands in their ranck'st suspitions dwell,
Then tis our best Art to dissemble well,
Put but these notes in vse, that Ile direct you,
Hele curse himselfe that ere he did suspect you,
Perhaps she will sollicite you, as in triall
To visit such and such, still giued deniall,

Let no perswasions sway you, they are but fetches
Set to betray you, Ielousies, slights and reaches,
Seeme in his sight to indure the sight of no man,
Put by all kisses, till you kisse in common,
Neglect all entertaine, if he bring in
Strangers, keepe you your chamber, be not seene;
If he chance steale vpon you, let him find,
Some booke lie open gainst an vnchast mind,
And coted Scriptures, tho for your owne pleasure,
You reade some stirring pamphlet, and conuay it
Vnder your Skirt, the fitest place to lay it,
This is the course my wench to inioy thy wishes,
Here you performe best, when you most neglect,
The way to daunt, is to outuie suspect,
Manage these principles but with Art and life,
Welcome all Nations, thou'rt an honest wife.
Hareb.
She puts it home yfaith, eu'n to the quicke
From her Elaborate action I reach that,
I must requite this maide, faith Im'e forgetfull.

Against you see me next you shall perceiue
I haue profited, in the meane season tel him
I am a prisoner yet, a'th masters side,
My husbands ielousie, that masters him, as he doth master me,
And as a keeper that locks prisoners vp,
Is himselfe prison'd vnder his owne key,
Euen so my husband in restraining me,
with the same ward bars his owne libertie.
Curt.
Ile tell him how you wish it, and Ile weare
My wits to the third pile, but all shall cleere.
Wife
I owe you more then thankes, but that I hope
My husband will requite you.
Curt.
Thinke you so Lady? he ha's small reason for't.

Hareb.
What done so soone? away, too't againe, too't a∣gain, good wench too't again, leaue her not so, where left you. come.

With all the arguments that sense can frame.
Hareb.
No; let me come, Fie wife, you must consent; what opinion i'st, let's heare?

Curtiz
Fondly and wilfully she retaines that thought, That euery sinne is dambd.

Hareb.
Oh fie, fie, wife! Pea, pea, pea, pea, how haue you lost your time? for shame be conuerted: theres a diabalocall opinion indeed; then you may think that vsury were dambd: you're a fine merchant yfaith; or briberie? you know the law well; or sloth? would some of the Clergy heard you yfaith; or pride? you come at Court; or gluttony? you're not wor∣thie to dine at an Aldermans table:

Your onely deadly sin's Adultery,
That villanous ring-worme, womans worst requitall,
Tis onely lechery thats dambd to'th pit-hole;
Ah, that's an arch-offence, beleeue it squall,
All sinnes are veniall but veneriall.
Curtiz.
I'ue said enough to her.

Hareb.
And she will be rulde by you.

Curtiz.

Hareb.
Ile pawne my credit ont; come hither Lady,
I will not altogether rest ingratefull,
Here, weare this Rubie for thy paines and counsell.
Curtiz.
It is not so much worth sir, I am a very ill coun∣sellor truely.

Hareb.
Goo too I say.

Curtiz.
Y'are too blame yfaith sir, I shall nere deserue it.

Hareb.
Thou hast don't already: farewell sweet Virgin, prethee let's see thee oftner.

Curtiz.
Such gifts will soone intreat me.

Exit.
Hareb.
Wife, as thou lou'st the quiet of my breast,
Embrace her counsell, yeeld to her aduices;
Thou wilt find comfort in e'm in the end;

T' was well preuented sir.

Sir Boun.
Silkin rest, harmonious slumbers, and venetiall dreames to your Lordship.

Fol.

Sir Boun.

Folly.
Old men should dreame best.

Sir Boun.
Their dreames indeed my L. y'aue gi'nt vs: to¦morrow your Lordship shal see my Cockes, my Fish-ponds, my Parke, my Champion grounds; I keepe Champers in my house can shew your Lordship some pleasure.

Nay, and you be at your distinctions Captaine, Ile follow behind no longer.

Fol.
Get you before then, and whelme your nose with your vizard, goe.

Now Grandsire, you that hold me at hard meat,
And keepe me out at the Dags end, Ile fit you;
Vnder his Lordships leaue, all must be mine
He and his Will confesses, what I take then
Is but a borrowing of so much before hand;
Ile pay him agen when he dies, in so many blacks,

Or requite him in Scutchions, let him trap me
In gold, and Ile lap him in lead; quid pro quo: I
Must looke none of his Angels in the face forsooth,
Vntill his face be not worth looking on; Tut lads,
Let Sires and Grandsires keepe vs low, we must
Liue when the're flesh, as well as when the're dust.

To make his purpose prosper in each limbe,
Which onely rests to be approu'd by him:
Make hast, I know he thirsts for't.

Folly w.
Linconsheere men Sir.

Sir Boun.
I am glad of that yfaith.

Folly-w.
And why should you be glad of that?

Sir Boun.
Oh, the honestest theeues of all come out of Lin∣consheere; the kindest naturde Gentlemen; the'le rob a man with conscience: they haue a feeling of what they go about, and will steale with teares in their eies: ah pitifull gentle∣men.

Folly-w.
Push, Money, money, we come for money.

Sir Boun.
Is that all you come for? Ah what a beast was I to put out my money tother day: alas good gentlemen, what shift shall I make for you? pray come agen another time.

Folly-w.
Tut, tut sir, money.

Sir Boun.
Oh not so loud sir, you're too shrill a Gentle∣man; I haue a L. lies in my house, I would not for the world his honour should be disquieted.

Folly-w.
Who my L. Owemuch? we haue tooke order with him before hand, he lies bound in his bed and al his followers.

Sir Boun.
Who my L? bound my L? Alas what did you meane to bind my L? he could keepe his bed well enough without binding: y'aue vndon me i'nt already, you need rob me no farder.

Folly-w.
Which is the Key, come?

Sir Boun.
Ah I perceiue now, y'are no true Linconsheere spirits; you come rather out of Bedforesheere, we cannot lie quiet in our beds for you: so, take enough my Masters; spur a free horse, my name's sir Bounteous, a merry world yfaith; what Knight but I keepe open house at midnight? well, there should be a conscience, if one could hit vppon't.

Folly-w.
Away now, ceaze vpon him, binde him.

Sir Boun.
Is this your Court of equity? why should I be bound for mine owne money? but come, come, bind me, I haue neede on't; I haue beene too liberall to night, keepe in my hands: nay, as hard as you list; I am too good to beare my L. company, you haue watcht your time my Masters; I was Knighted at Westminster, but many of these nights will make me a Knight of Windsor; y'aue deserude so well my

Pray meddle not with my Organs, to put e'm out of tune.

Folly-w.
Oh no, heeres better musicke sir.

Sir Boun.
Ah pox feast you.

Exit.
Folly-w.
Dispatch with him, away; so, thanke you good Grandsire; this was bounteously done of him yfaith; it came somewhat hard from him at first; for indeed nothing comes stiffe from an old man but money: and he may well stand vpon that, when he has nothing else to stand vpon: where's our Port-mantua?

Leift.

Folly-w.
In with the purchase, t'will lie safe enough there vnder's nose I warrant you: what, is all sure?

Enter Antient.
Ant.
All's sure Captaine.

Folly-w.
You know what followes now, one villane binds his fellowes; go, we must be all bound for our owne securi∣ties raskals, there's no dallying' vppo'th point; you conceit me: there is a L. to be found bound in the morning, and al his followers, can you picke out that L. now?

Leift.
O admirable spirit!

Folly-w.
You nere plot for your safeties, so your wants be satisfied.

Anti.
But if we binde one another, how shall the last man be bound?

Folly-w.
Pox on't, Ile haue the footman scape.

Foot.
Thats I, I thanke you sir.

Folly-w.
The Footman of all other will be supposde to scape, for he comes in no bed all night; but lies in's clothes, to be first ready i'th morning: the horse and he lies in litter to∣gether; that's the right fashion of your bonny Footman: and his freedome will make the better for our purpose; for we must haue one i'th morning to vnbinde the Knight, that we may haue our sport within our selues: we now arriue at the most ticklish point, to rob, and take our ease, to be theeues and

M. Pen.
What is't sweet Lady Gulman, that so seazes on thee with rapture and admiration?

Curtiz.
A thought, a tricke, to make you sir especially happy, and yet I my selfe a sauer by it.

M. Pen.
I would embrace that Lady with such courage, I would not leaue you on the loosing hand.

Curt.
I wil giue trust to you sir, the cause then why I raisde you from your bed so soone; wherein I know sighs would not let you sleepe, thus vnderstand it: You loue that woman (M. Harebraines wife) Which no inuented meanes can crowne with freedome, For your desires and her owne wish, but this, Which in my slumbers did present it selfe.

M. Pen.
I'me couetous Lady.

Curtiz.
you know her husband lingring in suspect, Lockes her from all society, but mine.

M. Pen.
Most true.

Curtiz.
I onely am admitted, yet hitherto That ha's done you no reall happines; by my admittance I cannot performe that deed, that should please you, You know: wherefore thus I'ue conuaid'd it, Ile counterfet a fit of violent sickenes.

M.Pen.
Good.

Curtiz.
Nay tis not so good by my faith, but to doe you good.

M. Pen.
And in that sense I call'd it, but take me with you Lady; would it be probable enough to haue a sickenes so suddenly violent?

Curtiz.
Puh, all the world knows women are soone down;

we can be sicke when we haue a mind to't, catch an ague with the wind of our fans, surfet vpon the rumpe of a Larke, and bestow ten pound in physick vpon't; we're likest our selues when we're down: tis the easiest Art and cunning for our sect to counterfeit sicke, that are alwaies full of sits when we are well; for since we were made for a weake imperfect crea∣ture, we can sit that best that we are made for: I thus transla∣ted, and your selfe slipt into the forme of a Physition.

Curt.
Tutman, any guacksaluing termes will serue for this purpose; for I am pitifully hanted with a brace of elder brothers, new perfumde in the first of their fortunes, and I shall see how forward their purses will be to the pleasing of my pallat, and restoring of my health; lay on load enough vpon e'm, and spare e'm not, for the're good plump fleshly Asses, and may well enough beare it: let gold, Ambre, and dissolued Pearle, be common ingrediences, and that you can∣not compose a cullisse without e'm: put but this cunningly in practise, it shall bee both a sufficient recompence for all my paines in your loue, and the readie meanes to make Mistris Harebraine; way, by the visiting of me to your mutuall desi∣red company.

Foot.
E'en by miracle, and lying in my clothes sir.

Sir Boun.
I thinke so, I would I had laine in my clothes to Footman, so I had scapt e'm; I could haue but risse like a beg∣ger then, and so I do now, till more money come in; but no∣thing afflicts me so much, my poore Geometricall Footman, as that the barberous villaines should lay violence vpon my L. Ah, the binding of my L. cuts my heart in two pieces; so, so, tis well, I thanke thee, runne to thy fellowes, vndo e'm, vn∣do e'm, vndo e'm.

Good morrow my L. tis I.

Folly-w.
Sir Bounteous good morrow, I would giue you my hand sir, but I cannot come at it; is this the curtesie a'th coun∣trie sir Bounteous?

Sir Boun.
Your Lordship grieues me more then al my losse; Tis the vnnatural'st sight that can be found, To see a noble gentleman hard-bound.

Folly-w.
Trust me, I thought you had beene better be∣lou'd sir Bounteous; but I see you haue enemies sir, and your friends fare the worse for em: I like your talke better then your lodging; I nere lay harder in a bedde of Downe; I haue had a madde nights rest on't: can you not gesle what they should be Sir Bounteous?

Thinke you so my Lord?

Folly-w.
I'le be burnt & they doe, some that vse to your house sir, and are familiar with all the couneiances.

Sir Boun.
This is the commoditie of keeping open house my Lord, that makes so many shut their doores about dinner time.

Folly-w.
They were resolute villaines, I made my selfe knowne to e'm, told e'm what I was; gaue e'm my honora∣ble word not to disclose e'm.

Sir Boun.
O sawcie vnmannerly villaines!

Folly-w.
And thinke you the slaues would trust me vpon my word?

Sir Boun.
They would not?

Folly-w.
Forsooth no, I must pardon e'm, they told mee Lords promises were mortal, and commonly die within halfe an houre after they are spoken; they were but gristles, and not one amongst a hundred come to any full groth, or per∣fection, and therefore tho I were a L. I must enter into bond.

Sir Boun.
Insupportable Rascals.

Folly-w.
Troth Im'e of that mind Sir Bounteous you far'd the worse for my coming hither.

Sir Boun.
Ah good my Lord, but Im'e sure your Lordship far'd the worse.

Pray pittie not me sir.

Sir Boun.
A pox discouer e'm, that twinge I feele too.

Since your worship will needs know't, they haue stolne away a iewell in a blew silke riband of a hundred pound price, beside some hundred pounds in faire Spur-Royals.

Your worship's much about it Sir.

Sir Boun.
Come follow me, Ile make that whole againe in so much money, let not my Lord know on't.

Lieft.
Oh pardon me Sir Bounteous, that were a dishonor to my Lord, should it come to his eare, I should hazard my vndoing by' it.

Sir Boun.
How should it come to his eare? if you be my Lords chiefe man about him, I hope you do not vse to speake, vnles you be paid for't, and I had rather giue you a Councel∣lors double Fee to hold your peace, come, go too, follow me I say.

Lady Gulman should be so violently handled?

Hareb.
Oh, sicknes has no mercy sir,
It neither pitties Ladies lip, nor eye,
It crops the Rose out of the Virgins cheeke,
And so deslowres her that was nere deslorw'd,
Fooles then are maides to locke from men that treasure,
Which death will plucke, and neuer yeeld e'm pleasure;
Ah gentlemen, tho I shadow it, that sweet Virgins sicknes griues mee not lightly, shee was my wiues onely delight and company;
Did you not heare her gentlemen, it'h midst
Of her extreamest sit, still how she cald vpon my wife,
Remembred still my wife, sweet mistris Harebraine,
When she sent for me, a one side of her bed stood the Phisiti∣an,
the Scriuener on the other, two horrible obiects, but,
meere opposites in the course of their liues, for the Scriuener
bindes folkes, and the Phisitian makes them loose.
Poss.
But not loose of their bonds Sir?

Hareb.
No by my faith sir, I say not so, if the Phisitian could make e'm loose of their bonds, ther's many a one would take Phisick, that dares not now for poysoning, but as I was telling of you, her Will was fashioning, Wherein I found her best and richest Iewell, Giuen as a Legacie vnto my wife, When I read that, I could not refraine weeping, well of all other, my wife ha's most reason to visit her, if shee haue any good nature in her, shee'le shew it there, now sir wher's your mistris?

Rafe
She desires you, and the gentlemen your friends, to hold her excused, sha's a fit of an Ague now vpon her, which begins to shake her

Hareb.
Where do's it shake her most?

Rafe
All ouer her body Sir.

Hareb.
Shake all her body? t'is a saucie fit, Im'e iealous of that Ague, pray walke in gentlemen, Ile see you instantly.

Now they are absent sir, tis no such thing.

Hareb.
What?

Page [unnumbered]
Rafe
My mistris has her health Sir,
But tis her sute, she may confine her selfe
From sight of all men, but your owne deere selfe Sir,
For since the sicknes of that modest Vergin
Her onely company, she delights in none;
Hareb.
No; visit her againe, commend me to her, Tell her they'r gon, and onely I my selfe Walke here to exchange a word or two with her.

Rafe
Ile tell her so sir.

Exit.
Hareb.
Foole that I am, and madman, beast! what worse?
Suspitious or'e a creature that deserues
The best opinion, and the purest thought,
Watchfull or'e her that is her watch her selfe,
To doubt her waies, that lookes too narrowly
Into her owne defects; I, foolish-fearefull
Haue often rudely, out of giddie flames
Bard her those obiects which shee shuns her selfe,
Thrice I'ue had proofe of her most constant temper,
Come I at vnawares by stealth vpon her,
I find her cercled in with Diuine Writs
Of heauenly meditations; here and there
Chapters with leaues tuckt vp, which when I see
They either taxe pride or adulterie,
Ah let me curse my selfe, that could be iealous
Of her whose mind no sinne can make rebellious.
And here the vnmatched comes, now wife yfaith they'r gon,
Push, see how fearefull tis, will you not credit me?
They'r gon yfaith, why, hinke you Ile betray you? come, come, thy delight and mine, thy onely vertuous friend, thy sweete instructresse is violently taken, grieuous sicke, and which is worse, she mends not.

Wife
Her friends are sorry for that Sir.

Shee cals still vpon thee, poore soule, remembers thee still, thy name whirles in her breath, wher's mistris Hare∣braine sayes shee?

Oh yet the kindnes of a thing wife; still she holds the same rare temper; take my man I say.

Wife.
I would not take your man sir, tho I did purpose going.

Hareb.
No? thy reason?

Wife
The worlds condition is it selfe so vild Sir,
Tis apt to iudge the worst, of those deserue not,
Tis an ill-thinking age, and do's apply
All to the forme of it owne Luxurie,
This censure flies from one, that, from another,
That man's her Squire, sayes he; her Pimpe, the tother,
Shee's of the stampe, a third, fourth, I ha knowne her:
Iu'e heard this, not without a burning cheeke:
Then our attires are taxt, our very gate
Is cal'd in question, where a husbands presence
Scatters such thoughts, or makes e'm sinke for feare
Into the hearts that breed e'm, nay surely if I went Sir,
I would entreat your company.
Hareb.
Mine? prethee wife, I haue beene there alreadle.

Wife
That's all one; altho you bring mee but to'th doore Sir, I would intreat no farther.

Hareb.
Thu'rt such a wife; why I will bring thee thither then, but not goe vp I sweare.

Wife
Yfaith you shall not, I doe not desire it sir.

Hareb.
Why then content.

Wife
Giue me your hand you will doe so Sir.

Hareb.
Why ther's my lip I will.

Wife
Why then I goe Sir.

With me or no man, incomparable such a woman.

And ransack the close corners of their hearts;

Curtiz.
Pray sit downe, there's a low stoole, good Mistris Harebraine, this was kindly done; huh giue me your hand; huh, alas how cold you are: eu'n so is your husband, that worthy wise Gentleman; as comfortable a man to woman in my case, as euer trod—huh—shooe leather, loue him, honour him, sticke by him, hee lets you want nothing, that's fit for a woman; and to be sure on't, he wil see himselfe that you want it not.

Hareb.

Shee's weeping, t'as made her weepe, my wife shewes her good nature already.

Curt.
Still, still weeping? huff, huff, huff, why how now woman? hey, hy, hy, for shame leaue; suh, suh, she cannot an∣swere me for snobbing.

Hareb.
All this do's her good, beshrew my heart and I pi∣ty her, let her shed teares till morning; Ile stay for her, she shall haue enough on't by my good will; Ile not be her hin∣derance.

Curt.
O no, lay your hand here Mistris Harebraine: I there, Oh there, there lies my paine good gentlewoman: sore? Oh I, I can scarce endure your hand vppon't.

Art of Ladies.
When plots are ee'n past hope, and hang their head,
Set with a womans hand, they thriue and spread.
Exit.
Enter Folly-wit with Lieftenant Maw-worme, Antient Hoboy, and the rest of his consorts.
Folly-w.
Wast not wel manag'de, you necessary mischiefs? did the plot want either life or Art?

Lief.
Tw's so well Captaine, I would you could make such another Musse at all aduentures.

Folly w.
Do'st cal't a Musse? I am sure my Grandsire nere got his money worse in his life, then I got it from him, if euer he did cozen the simple; why I was borne to reuenge their quarrell; if euer oppresse the widdow? I, a fatherles child haue done as much for him; and so tis through the world ei∣ther in iest or earnest, let the vserer looke for't, for craft re∣coyles in the end, like an ouercharg'd musket, and maymes the very hand that puts fire too't; there needs no more but a Vsurers owne blow to strike him from hence to hell, twil set him forward with a vengeance; but here lay the iest whore∣sons, my Grandsire thinking in his conscience that wee had not rob'd him ynough or'e night, must needs pittie mee it'h morning, and giue me the rest.

Lieft.
Two hundred pounds in faire Rose-Nobles I protest.

Folly-w.
Push, I knew he could not sleep quietly til he had pay'd me for robing of him too, tis his humour, & the humor of most of your rich men in the course of their liues; for you know, they alwaies feast those mouthes that are least nedie, and giue them more, that haue too much alreadie; and what call you that, but robing of themselues a Courtlyer way; Oh.

Lieft.
Cuds me, how now Captaine?

Folly-w.
A cold fit that comes ouer my memory, and has a shrode pull at my fortunes.

Lieft.

Folly-w.
Is it for certaine, Lieftenant, that my Grandsire keepes an vncertaine creature, a Queane?

Lieft.
I that's too true Sir.

Folly-w.
So much the more 'preposterous for mee, I shall
hop shorter by that tricke; she carries away the thirds at least;
twill proue en-tayld land I am afraid when al's done, yfaith
nay, I haue knowne a vicious-old-thought-acting Father,
Damb'd onely in his dreames, thirsting for game,
(When his best parts hung downe their heads for shame,)
For his blancht harlot dispossesse his sonne,
And make the pox his heire, twa's grauely done:
How had'st thou first knowledge on't Lieftenant?
Lieft.
Faith from discourse, yet all the pollicie That I could vse, I could not get her name.

Folly-w.
Dull slaue that ne're could'st spie it.

Lieft.
But the māner of her coming was describ'd to me.

Folly-w.
How is the manner prethee?

Lieft.
Marry sir she comes, most commonly coacht.

Folly w.
Most commonly coacht indeed, for coaches are as common now adayes, as some that ride in e'm, shee comes most commonly coacht.

Lief.
True, there I left sir, guarded with some leash of Pimps.

Folly-w.
Beside the coachman?

Lieft.
Right sir, then alighting, shee's priuatly receiu'd by master Gunwater.

Folly-w.
That's my Grandsires chiefe Gentleman it'h chaine of gold, that hee should liue to bee a Pander, and yet looke vpon his chaine and his veluet iacket

Lieft.
Then is your Grandsire rounded it'h eare, the key giuen after the Italian fashion, backward, she closly conuaid into his closet, there remaining, till either opportunitie smile vpon his credit, or hee send downe some hot caudle to take order in his performance.

Folly-w.
Peace, tis mine owne yfaith, I haa'te.

Lieft.
How now Sir?

Folly-w.
Thankes, thankes to any spirit, That mingled it mongst my inuentions.

Folly-w.
And all at one dealing?

Ant.

Folly-w.
And thou shalt see't quickly yfaith; nay tis in graine, I warrant it hold colour: Leiftenant, step behind yo'n hanging; if I mistooke not at my entrance, there hangs the lower part of a gentlewomans gowne, with a maske and a chinclout; bring all this way: Nay, but doo't cunningly now, tis a friends house, and I'de vfe it so, ther's a tast for you.

Ant.
But prethee what wilt thou doe with a Gentlewo∣mans lower part?

Folly-w.
Why vse it.

Ant.
Y'aue answered me indeed in that, I can demand no farder.

Folly.
Well said Leiftenant.

Leift.
What will you do now sir?

Folly-w.
Come, come, thou shalt see a woman quickely made vp here.

Leift.
But that's against kind Captaine, for they are al∣waies long a making ready.

Folly-w.
And is not most they doe against kind I prethee? to lie with their Horse-keeper, is not that against kind? to weare half moons made of anothers haire, is not that against kind? to drinke downe a man, she that should set him vp, pray is not that monstrously against kind now? nay ouer with it Leiftenant, ouer with it, euer while you liue put a womans clothes ouer her head: Cupid plaies best at blind-man buff.

Leift.
You shal haue your will maintenance, I loue madde trickes as well as you for your heart sir; but what shift will you make for vpper bodies Captaine?

Drawes the Diuorce twixt heauen and the soule!
Accursed man that standst diuors't from heauen,
Thou wretched vnthrift, that hast playd away
Thy Eternall portion at a minutes game,
To please the flesh, hast blotted out thy name:
Where were thy nobler meditations busied?
That they durst trust this body with it selfe,
This naturall drunkard that vndoes vs all,
And makes our shame apparant in our fall.
Then let my bloud pay fort, and vex and boyle,
My soule I know would neuer grieue tot'h death,
The Eternall spirit that feeds her with his breath:
Nay I that knew the price of life and sinne,
What Crowne is kept for continence, what for lust?
The end of man, and glory of that end
As endlesse as the giuer:
To doat on weaknesse, slime, corruption, woman?
What is she, tooke asunder from her clothes?
Being ready, she consists of hundred peeces,
Much like your German cloak, and nere allyed
Both are so nice, they cannot goe for pride.
Beside a greater fault, but too well knowne,
Theyle strike to ten, when they shold stop at one;
Within these three daies the next meeting's fixt,
If I meet then, hell and my soule be mixt.
My lodging I know constantly, she not knowes,
Sins hate is the best guift that sin bestowes:

Welcome sweete cockscombe; by my faith a good in∣duction, I perceiue by his ouerworne phrase, and his action to∣ward the middle region still there has bin some saucy nibling motion, and no doubt the cunning queane waited but for her prey, and I thinke tis better bestowd vpon me for his soules health;—and his bodies too; ile teache the slaue to be so bould yet, as once to offer to vault into his masters saddle yfaith: Now Casket, by your leaue, I haue seene your outside oft, but

Grandsire, you may thanke your Drab for this; oh fye, in your crinckling dayes Grandsire, keepe a Curtizan to hinder your Grandchild, tis against Nature yfaith, and I hope youle be weary ont: Now to my villaines that lurke close below: Who keepes a Harlot tell him this from me, He needes nor theese, disease, nor enemy.

It may be but my fancy, or her physicke: For this I know, her health gaue such content, The fault rests in her sicknesse, or my sent. How dost thou now sweete girle, what well recouerd? Sicknesse quite gone, ha? speake—ha? wench? Franke Gulman, why body of me, whats here? my Casket wide open, broke open, my Iewells stolne—why Gumwater—

Ah fie, fie, fie, fie, fie, but I perceiue
Tho she haue neuer so compleate a friend,
a strumpets loue will haue a wast i'th end,

But say I should complaine, perhaps she has pawnd 'em,
Sfoote the Iudges will but laugh at it, and bid her borrowe
more money of em, make the old fellow pay for's lechery,
thats all the mends I get, I haue seene the same Cafe tryed at
Newbery the last Sizes.

But whilst I liue, ile neyther loue nor trust her.

My mistrisse is within sir.

Mast. Pae.
When came she in I pray?

Seruus.
Who my mistrisse? she was not out these two dayes to my knowledge.

Mast. Pae.
No? trust me Ide thought I'de seene her, I would request a word with her.

That face, that voyce, that gesture, that attire,

That Beuer band, the colour of that Periwig,
The Farthingale abone the Nauill, all;
As if the fashion were his owne inuention,

To beguile me more.
The cunning Succubus told me that meeting
Was wrought a purpose by much wit and Art,
Wept to me, laide my vowes before me, vrgd me,
Gaue me the priuate markes of all our Loue,
Wood me in wanton and effeminate rimes,
And sung and danst about me like a Fayry,
And had not worthier cogitations blest me,
Thy forme and his enchantments had possest me.
Wife.
What shall become of me my owne thoughts doome mee.

Mast. Pae.
Be honest; then the Diuell will nere assume thee,
He has no pleasure in that shape to abide,
Where these two sisters raigne not, lust of pride;
He as much trembles at a constant mind
As looser flesh at him,—be not dismayde:
Spring soules for ioy, his policies are betrayde;
Forgiue me mistrisse Hargraue, on whose soule
The guilt hangs double,
My lust and thy enticement: both I challenge,
And therefore of due vengeance it appeard
To none but me to whome both sins inher'd;
What knowes the lecher when he clips his whore
Whether it be the Diuell his parts adore:
They're both so like, that in our Naturall sence,
I could discerne no change nor difference.
No maruell then times should so stretch and turne
None for Religion, all for pleasure burne.
Hot zeale into hot lust is now transformde,
Grace into paynting, charity into clothes,
Faith into false hayre, and put off as often,
Theres nothing but our vertue knowes a meane,
He that kept open house now keepes a Queane.
He will keep open still, that he commends,
And there he keeps a table for his friends:
And she consumes more then her Sire could hoord,

Being more common then his house or boord:

Embrace thy husband, and beside him none,
Hauing but one heart, giue it but to one.

No man shall euer wrong my husbands bed.

Oh in good time, I like the gentlewoman well, a pre∣ty contriu'd beauty,

Mother.
I, nature has done her part sir.

Folly.
But she has one vncomely quality.

Mother.
Whats that sir?

Folly.
Sfoote she's afraid of a man.

Mother.
A lasse, impute that to her bashfull spirit, she's fear∣full of her honour.

Folly.
Of her honour? slid 'ime sure I cannot get her mai∣den head with breathing vpon her, nor can she loose her ho∣nour in her tongue.

Mother.
True, and I haue often told her so, but what would you haue of a foolish virgine sir, a wilfull virgine, I tell you sir, I neede not haue beene in that solitarie estate that I am, had she had grace and boldnes to haue put her selfe forward, alwaies timorsome, alwaies backward, ah that same peeuish honour of hers, has vndone her and me both good gentlemā: the suitors, the iewels, the ioynters that has beene offerd her, wee had beene made women for euer, but what was her fa∣shion? she could not indure the sight of a man for sooth, but run and hole her selfe presently, so choice of her honour, I am perswaded, when ere she has husband, she wil eene be a presi∣dent for all married wiues, how to direct their actions, and their liues.

Folly.
Would I might be hangd, if my loue do not stretch to her deeper and deeper, those bashfull maiden humors take me prisoner when their comes a restraint ont vpon flesh, wee are alwaies most greedy vppont, & that makes your merchāts wife oftentimes pay so deare for a monthfull: giue me a wo∣man as she was made at first, simple of her selfe, without So∣phistication, like this wench, I cannot abide them when they haue tricks, set speeches & Artfull entertainments, you shall haue some so impudently aspected, they will outcry the fore∣head of a man, make him blush first, & talke him into silence, & this is counted manly in a woman, it may hold so, sure wo∣manly it is not, no, If ere I loue, or any thing moue me,

T will be a womans simple modesty.

Enter Mother bringing in striuingly the Curtezan.
Curte.
Pray let me go, why mother what doe you meane? I beseech you mother? is this your conquest now? great glory tis to ouercome a pore and silly virgine.

Folly.
The wonder of our time sits in that browe,
I nere beheld a perfit man till now.
Mo.
Thou childish thing, more bashfull then thour't wise,
Why dost thou turne aside, and drowne thine eies?
Looke fearefull foole, theres no tēptation nere thee,
Art not ashamd that any flesh should feare thee,
VVhy I durst pawne my life the gentleman meanes no other but honest and pure loue to thee, how say you sir?

Folly.
By my faith not I Lady.

Mo.
Harke you there? what think you now forsooth? what greeues your honour now?
Or what lasciuious breath intends to reare
Against that maiden Organ your chaste care?
Are you resolu'd now better of mens harts?
Their faiths and their affections, with you none,
Or at most, fewe whose tongues and minds are one.
Repent you now of your opinion past,
Men loue as purely as you can be chaste: to her your selfe sir,

How meane you that sir?

Folly.
Sfoot as one loues a woman for a wife,

Mother.
Has the gentleman answered you, tro?

Folly.
I do confesse it truely to you both,
My estate is yet but sickly, but I'ue a Grandsire
Will make me Lord of thousands at his death.
Mother.
I know your Grandsire well; she knowes him bet∣ter.

Folly.
Why then you know no fiction; my state then will be a long dayes iourney 'boue the wast wench.

Mo.
Nay daughter he sayes true.

Folly.
And thou shalt often measure it in thy coache,
And with the wheels tract make a gridle for't.
Mo.
Ah twilll be a merry iourny.

Folly.
What ist a match, if't be clap hands & lips;

Mo.
Tis done, ther's witnesse on't.

Folly.
Why then mother I salute you.

Mother.
Thanks sweet sonne;—Sonne Folliwit, come hither, if I might counsell thee, weele eene take her while the good moods vpon her, send for a Priest, and clapt vp within this hower.

Folly.
By my troth agreed mother.

Mo.
Nor do's her wealth consist all in her flesh,
Tho beauty be enough wealth for a woman,
She brings a Dowry of three hundred pound with her.
Folly.
Sfoote that will serue till my Grandsire dyes I warrant you, heele drop away at fall a'th leafe, if euer he reach to all Hollantide ile be hangd.

They're here now, & anon no scouts can reach em
Being euery man well horst like a bold Beacham,
The Play which we present, no fault shall meere
But one, youle say tis short, weele say tis sweete:
Tis giuen much to dumb showes, which some prayse,
And like the Terme, delights much in delayes.
So to conclude, and giue the name her due,
The play being calld the Slip, I vanish too.

Brought by a Constable before thee, his vilde associates with him,
But so disguizde, none knowes him but my selfe,
Twice haue I set him free from officers sangs,
And for his sake, his fellowes: let him looke too't:
My conscience will permit but one winke more.
Sir Boun.
Yee shall we take Iustice winking.

Folly.
For this time I haue be thought a meanes to worke thy
freedome, tho hazarding my selfe; should the Law ceaze him,
Being kin to me, twould blenush much my name, No;

Who liues by cunning marke it, his fates cast,
When he has guld all, then is himselfe the last.
