                      ACT I. SCENE I.

          _Palermo. A State-room in the Palace._

_Enter_ ASTUTIO _and_ ADORNI.

  _Ador._ Good day to your lordship.

  _Ast._ Thanks, Adorni.

  _Ador._ May I presume to ask if the ambassador
  Employ'd by Ferdinand, the duke of Urbin,
  Hath audience this morning?

_Enter_ FULGENTIO.

  _Ast._ 'Tis uncertain;
  For, though a counsellor of state, I am not
  Of the cabinet council: but there's one, if he please,
  That may resolve you.

  _Ador._ I will move him.--Sir!

  _Ful._ If you've a suit, show water[133], I am blind else.

  _Ador._ A suit; yet of a nature not to prove
  The quarry[134] that you hawk for: if your words
  Are not like Indian wares, and every scruple
  To be weigh'd and rated, one poor syllable,
  Vouchsafed in answer of a fair demand,
  Cannot deserve a fee.

  _Ful._ It seems you are ignorant,
  I neither speak nor hold my peace for nothing;
  And yet, for once, I care not if I answer
  One single question, gratis.

  _Ador._ I much thank you.
  Hath the ambassador audience, sir, to-day?

  _Ful._ Yes.

  _Ador._ At what hour?

  _Ful._ I promised not so much.
  A syllable you begg'd, my charity gave it;
  Move me no further.                        [_Exit._

  _Ast._ This you wonder at:
  With me, 'tis usual.

  _Ador._ Pray you, sir, what is he?

  _Ast._ No gentleman, yet a lord. He hath some drops
  Of the king's blood running in his veins, derived
  Some ten degrees off. His revenue lies
  In a narrow compass, the king's ear; and yields him
  Every hour a fruitful harvest. Men may talk
  Of three crops in a year in the Fortunate Islands,
  Or profit made by wool; but, while there are suitors,
  His sheepshearing, nay, shaving to the quick,
  Is in every quarter of the moon, and constant.
  In the time of trussing a point,[135] he can undo,
  Or make a man: his play or recreation,
  Is to raise this up, or pull down that; and, though
  He never yet took orders, makes more bishops
  In Sicily, than the pope himself.

_Enter_ BERTOLDO, GASPARO, ANTONIO, _and a Servant_.

  _Ador._ Most strange!

  _Ast._ The presence fills. He in the Malta habit[136]
  Is the king's natural brother.

  _Ador._ I understand you.

  _Bert._ With this jewel
  Presented to Camiola, prepare,
  This night, a visit for me. [_Exit Servant._] I shall have
  Your company, gallants, I perceive, if that
  The king will hear of war.

  _Ant._ You are, sir,
  A knight of Malta, and, as I have heard,
  Have served against the Turk.

  _Bert._ 'Tis true.

  _Ant._ Pray you, show us
  The difference between the city valour,
  And service in the field.

  _Bert._ 'Tis somewhat more
  Than roaring in a tavern or a brothel,
  Or to steal a constable[137] from a sleeping watch,
  Then burn their halberds; or, safe guarded by
  Your tenant's sons, to carry away a May-pole
  From a neighbour village. You will not find there
  Your masters of dependencies[138] to take up
  A drunken brawl, or, to get you the names
  Of valiant chevaliers, fellows that will be,
  For a cloak with thrice-dyed velvet, and a cast suit,
  Kick'd down the stairs. A knave with a provant sword[139],
  If you bear not yourself both in and upright,
  Will slash your scarlets and your plush a new way;
  Or, with the hilts, thunder about your ears
  Such music as will make your worships dance
  To the doleful tune of _Lachrymæ_[140].

  _Gasp._ I must tell you
  In private, as you are my princely friend,
  I do not like such fiddlers.

  _Bert._ No! they are useful
  For your imitation; I remember you,
  When you came first to the court, and talk'd of nothing
  But your rents and your entradas[141], ever chiming
  The golden bells in your pockets; you believed
  The taking of the wall as a tribute due to
  Your gaudy clothes; and could not walk at midnight
  Without a causeless quarrel, as if men
  Of coarser outsides were in duty bound
  To suffer your affronts: but, when you had been
  Cudgell'd well twice or thrice, and from the doctrine
  Made profitable uses, you concluded,
  The sovereign means to teach irregular heirs
  Civility, with conformity of manners,
  Were two or three sound beatings.

  _Ant._ I confess
  They did much good upon me.

  _Gasp._ And on me:
  The principles that they read were sound.

  _Bert._ You'll find
  The like instructions in the camp.

  _Ast._ The king!

_A flourish. Enter_ ROBERTO, FULGENTIO, _Ambassador, and Attendants_.

  _Rob._ [_ascends the throne._] We sit prepared to hear.

  _Amb._ Your majesty
  Hath been long since familiar, I doubt not,
  With the desperate fortunes of my lord; and pity
  Of the much that your confederate hath suffer'd,
  You being his last refuge, may persuade you
  Not alone to compassionate, but to lend
  Your royal aids to stay him in his fall
  To certain ruin. He, too late, is conscious
  That his ambition to encroach upon
  His neighbour's territories, with the danger of
  His liberty, nay, his life, hath brought in question
  His own inheritance: but youth, and heat
  Of blood, in your interpretation, may
  Both plead and mediate for him. I must grant it
  An error in him, being denied the favours
  Of the fair princess of Sienna, (though
  He sought her in a noble way,) to endeavour
  To force affection by surprisal of
  Her principal seat, Sienna.

  _Rob._ Which now proves
  The seat of his captivity, not triumph:
  Heaven is still just.

  _Amb._ And yet that justice is
  To be with mercy temper'd, which heaven's deputies
  Stand bound to minister. The injured duchess,
  By reason taught, as nature, could not, with
  The reparation of her wrongs, but aim at
  A brave revenge; and my lord feels, too late,
  That innocence will find friends. The great Gonzaga,
  The honour of his order, (I must praise
  Virtue, though in an enemy,) he whose fights
  And conquests hold one number, rallying up
  Her scatter'd troops, before we could get time
  To victual or to man the conquer'd city,
  Sat down before it; and presuming that
  'Tis not to be relieved, admits no parley,
  Our flags of truce hung out in vain: nor will he
  Lend an ear to composition, but exacts,
  With the rendering up the town, the goods and lives
  Of all within the walls, and of all sexes,
  To be at his discretion.

  _Rob._ Since injustice
  In your duke meets this correction, can you press us,
  With any seeming argument of reason,
  In foolish pity to decline[142] his dangers,
  To draw them on ourself? Shall we not be
  Warn'd by his harms? The league proclaim'd between us
  Bound neither of us further than to aid
  Each other, if by foreign force invaded;
  And so far in my honour I was tied.
  But since, without our counsel, or allowance,
  He hath ta'en arms; with his good leave, he must
  Excuse us if we steer not on a rock
  We see, and may avoid. Let other monarchs
  Contend to be made glorious by proud war,
  And, with the blood of their poor subjects, purchase
  Increase of empire, and augment their cares
  In keeping that which was by wrongs extorted,
  Gilding unjust invasions with the trim
  Of glorious conquests; we, that would be known
  The father of our people, in our study
  And vigilance for their safety, must not change
  Their ploughshares into swords, and force them from
  The secure shade of their own vines, to be
  Scorch'd with the flames of war; or, for our sport,
  Expose their lives to ruin.

  _Amb._ Will you, then,
  In his extremity, forsake your friend?

  _Rob._ No; but preserve ourself.

  _Bert._ Cannot the beams
  Of honour thaw your icy fears?

  _Rob._ Who's that?

  _Bert._ A kind of brother, sir, howe'er your subject;
  Your father's son, and one who blushes that
  You are not heir to his brave spirit and vigour,
  As to his kingdom.

  _Rob._ How's this!

  _Bert._ Sir, to be
  His living chronicle, and to speak his praise,
  Cannot deserve your anger.

  _Rob._ Where's your warrant
  For this presumption?

  _Bert._ Here, sir, in my heart:
  Let sycophants, that feed upon your favours,
  Style coldness in you caution, and prefer
  Your ease before your honour; and conclude,
  To eat and sleep supinely is the end
  Of human blessings: I must tell you, sir,
  Virtue, if not in action, is a vice;
  And when we move not forward, we go backward[143]:
  Nor is this peace, the nurse of drones and cowards,
  Our health, but a disease.

  _Gasp._ Well urged, my lord.

  _Ant._ Perfect what is so well begun.

  _Amb._ And bind
  My lord your servant.

  _Rob._ Hair-brain'd fool! what reason
  Canst thou infer, to make this good?

  _Bert._ A thousand,
  Not to be contradicted. But consider
  Where your command lies: 'tis not, sir, in France,
  Spain, Germany, Portugal, but in Sicily;
  An island, sir. Here are no mines of gold
  Or silver to enrich you; no worm spins
  Silk in her womb, to make distinction
  Between you and a peasant, in your habits;
  No fish lives near our shores, whose blood can dye
  Scarlet or purple; all that we possess,
  With beasts we have in common: nature did
  Design us to be warriors, and to break through
  Our ring, the sea, by which we are environ'd;
  And we by force must fetch in what is wanting,
  Or precious to us. Add to this, we are
  A populous nation, and increase so fast,
  That, if we by our providence are not sent
  Abroad in colonies, or fall by the sword,
  Not Sicily, though now it were more fruitful
  Than when 't was styled the granary of great Rome,
  Can yield our numerous fry bread: we must starve,
  Or eat up one another.

  _Ador._ The king hears
  With much attention.

  _Ast._ And seems moved with what
  Bertoldo hath deliver'd.

  _Bert._ May you live long, sir,
  The king of peace, so you deny not us
  The glory of the war; let not our nerves
  Shrink up with sloth, nor, for want of employment,
  Make younger brothers thieves: it is their swords, sir,
  Must sow and reap their harvest. If examples
  May move you more than arguments, look on England,
  The empress of the European isles,
  And unto whom alone ours yields precedence:
  When did she flourish so, as when she was
  The mistress of the ocean, her navies
  Putting a girdle round about the world?
  When the Iberian quaked, her worthies named;
  And the fair flower-de-luce grew pale, set by
  The red rose and the white? Let not our armour
  Hung up, or our unrigg'd armada, make us
  Ridiculous to the late poor snakes our neighbours,
  Warm'd in our bosoms, and to whom again
  We may be terrible. Rouse us, sir, from the sleep
  Of idleness, and redeem our mortgaged honours.
  Your birth, and justly, claims my father's kingdom;
  But his heroic mind descends to me:
  I will confirm so much.

  _Ador._ In his looks he seems
  To break ope Janus' temple.

  _Ast._ How these younglings
  Take fire from him!

  _Ador._ It works an alteration
  Upon the king.

  _Ant._ I can forbear no longer:
  War, war, my sovereign!

  _Ful._ The king appears
  Resolved, and does prepare to speak.

  _Rob._ Think not
  Our counsel 's built upon so weak a base,
  As to be overturn'd, or shaken, with
  Tempestuous winds of words. As I, my lord,
  Before resolved you, I will not engage
  My person in this quarrel; neither press
  My subjects to maintain it: yet, to show
  My rule is gentle, and that I have feeling
  O' your master's sufferings, since these gallants, weary
  Of the happiness of peace, desire to taste
  The bitter sweets of war, we do consent
  That, as adventurers and volunteers,
  No way compell'd by us, they may make trial
  Of their boasted valours.

  _Bert._ We desire no more.

  _Rob._ 'Tis well; and, but my grant in this, expect not
  Assistance from me. Govern, as you please,
  The province you make choice of; for, I vow
  By all things sacred, if that thou miscarry
  In this rash undertaking, I will hear it
  No otherwise than as a sad disaster,
  Fallen on a stranger; nor will I esteem
  That man my subject, who, in thy extremes,
  In purse or person aids thee. Take your fortune:
  You know me; I have said it. So, my lord,
  You have my absolute answer.

  _Amb._ My prince pays,
  In me, his duty.

  _Rob._ Follow me, Fulgentio,
  And you, Astutio.
    [_Flourish. Exeunt_ ROBERTO, FULGENTIO, ASTUTIO, _and Attendants_.

  _Gasp._ What a frown he threw,
  At his departure, on you!

  _Bert._ Let him keep
  His smiles for his state flatterer, I care not.

  _Ant._ Shall we aboard to night?

  _Amb._ Your speed, my lord,
  Doubles the benefit.

  _Bert._ I have a business
  Requires despatch; some two hours hence I'll meet you.      [_Exeunt._



                          SCENE II.

          _The same. A Room in_ CAMIOLA'_s House_.

_Enter Signior_ SYLLI, _walking fantastically, followed by_ CAMIOLA
_and_ CLARINDA.

  _Cam._ Nay, signior, this is too much ceremony,
  In my own house.

  _Syl._ What's gracious abroad,
  Must be in private practised.

  _Clar._ For your mirth's sake
  Let him alone; he has been all this morning
  In practice with a peruked gentleman-usher,
  To teach him his true amble, and his postures,
                [SYLLI _walking by, and practising_.
  When he walks before a lady.

  _Syl._ You may, madam,
  Perhaps, believe that I in this use art,
  To make you dote upon me, by exposing
  My more than most rare features to your view:
  But I, as I have ever done, deal simply.
  Look not with too much contemplation on me;
  If you do, you are lost.

  _Cam._ Is 't possible?
  What philters or love-powders do you use,
  To force affection? I see nothing in
  Your person but I dare look on, yet keep
  My own poor heart still.

  _Syl._ You are warn'd--be arm'd;
  And do not lose the hope of such a husband,
  In being too soon enamour'd.

  _Cam._ Never fear it;
  Though your best taking part, your wealth, were trebled,
  I would not woo you. But since in your pity
  You please to give me caution, tell me what
  Temptations I must fly from.

  _Syl._ The first is,
  That you never hear me sing, for I'm a Syren:
  If you observe, when I warble, the dogs howl,
  As ravish'd with my ditties; and you will
  Run mad to hear me.

  _Cam._ I will stop my ears,
  And keep my little wits.

  _Syl._ Next, when I dance,
  And come aloft thus, [_capers_] cast not a sheep's eye
  Upon the quivering of my calf.

  _Cam._ Proceed, sir.

  _Syl._ Nor should your little ladyship be taken with
  My pretty spider-fingers, nor my eyes,
  That twinkle on both sides.

  _Cam._ Was there ever such
  A piece of motley[144] heard of! [_A knocking within._]
      Who's that? [_Exit_ CLARINDA.] You may spare
  The catalogue of my dangers.

  _Syl._ No, good madam;
  I have not told you half.

  _Cam._ Enough, good signior.--

_Re-enter_ CLARINDA.

  Who is 't?

  _Clar._ The brother of the king.

  _Syl._ Nay, start not.
  The brother of the king! is he no more?
  Were it the king himself, I'd give him leave
  To speak his mind to you, for I am not jealous;
  And, to assure your ladyship of so much,
  I'll usher him in, and, that done--hide myself,
                                    [_Aside, and exit._

  _Cam._ Camiola, if ever, now be constant:
  This is, indeed, a suitor, whose sweet presence,
  Courtship, and loving language, would have stagger'd
  The chaste Penelope; and, to increase
  The wonder, did not modesty forbid it,
  I should ask that from him he sues to me for:
  And yet my reason, like a tyrant, tells me
  I must nor give nor take it.

_Re-enter_ SYLLI _with_ BERTOLDO.

  _Syl._ I must tell you,
  You lose your labour. Yet you shall have my countenance
  To parley with her, and I'll take special care
  That none shall interrupt you.

  _Bert._ You are courteous.

  _Syl._ Come, wench, wilt thou hear wisdom?

  _Clar._ Yes, from you, sir.      [_They walk aside._

  _Bert._ If forcing this sweet favour from your hand,
      [_Kisses her hand._
  Fair madam, argue me of too much boldness,
  When you are pleased to understand I take
  A parting kiss, if not excuse, at least
  'Twill qualify the offence.

  _Cam._ A parting kiss, sir!
  What nation, envious of the happiness
  Which Sicily enjoys in your sweet presence,
  Can buy you from her? or what climate yield
  Pleasures transcending those which you enjoy here,
  Being both beloved and honour'd; the north-star
  And guider of all hearts; and, to sum up
  Your full account of happiness in a word,
  The brother of the king?

  _Bert._ Do you, alone,
  And with an unexampled cruelty,
  Enforce my absence, and deprive me of
  Those blessings which you, with a polish'd phrase,
  Seem to insinuate that I do possess,
  And yet tax me as being guilty of
  My wilful exile? What are titles to me,
  Or popular suffrage, or my nearness to
  The king in blood, or fruitful Sicily,
  Though it confess'd no sovereign but myself,
  When you, that are the essence of my being,
  The anchor of my hopes, the real substance
  Of my felicity, in your disdain,
  Turn all to fading and deceiving shadows?

  _Cam._ You tax me without cause.

  _Bert._ You must confess it.
  But answer love with love, and seal the contract
  In the uniting of our souls, how gladly
  (Though now I were in action, and assured,
  Following my fortune, that plumed Victory
  Would make her glorious stand upon my tent)
  Would I put off my armour, in my heat
  Of conquest, and, like Antony, pursue
  My Cleopatra! Will you yet look on me
  With an eye of favour?

  _Cam._ Truth bear witness for me,
  That, in the judgment of my soul, you are
  A man so absolute, and circular,
  In all those wish'd-for rarities that may take
  A virgin captive, that, though at this instant
  All scepter'd monarchs of our western world
  Were rivals with you, and Camiola worthy
  Of such a competition, you alone
  Should wear the garland.

  _Bert._ If so, what diverts
  Your favour from me?

  _Cam._ No mulct in yourself,
  Or in your person, mind, or fortune.

  _Bert._ What then?

  _Cam._ The consciousness of mine own wants: alas! sir,
  We are not parallels; but, like lines divided,
  Can ne'er meet in one centre[145]. Your birth, sir,
  Without addition, were an ample dowry
  For one of fairer fortunes; and this shape,
  Were you ignoble, far above all value:
  To this so clear a mind, so furnish'd with
  Harmonious faculties moulded from heaven,
  That though you were Thersites in your features,
  Of no descent, and Irus in your fortunes,
  Ulysses-like, you'd force all eyes and ears
  To love, but seen; and, when heard, wonder at
  Your matchless story: but all these bound up
  Together in one volume!--give me leave
  With admiration to look upon them;
  But not presume, in my own flattering hopes,
  I may or can enjoy them.

  In the Proëme to Herbert's Travels, which were printed not
  long after The Maid of Honour, a similar expression is found:
  "Great Britaine--containes the summe and abridge of all sorts
  of excellencies, _met here like parallels in their proper centre_."

  In the life of Dr. H. More (1710) there is a letter to a correspondent
  who had sent him a pious treatise, in which the
  same expression occurs, and is thus noticed by the doctor:
  "There is but one passage that I remember, which will afford
  them (the profane and atheistical rout of the age) a disingenuous
  satisfaction; which is in p. 489, where you say that _straight
  lines drawn from the centre run parallel together_. To a candid
  reader your intended sense can be no other than that they run
  [Greek: par allêlas], that is, by one another; which they may do,
  though they do not run all along equidistantly one by another,
  which is the mathematical sense of the word parallel."--_Gent.
  Mag._ May, 1782. The good doctor is, I think, the best critic
  on the subject that has yet appeared, and sufficiently explains
  Massinger.--GIFFORD.

  _Bert._ How you ruin
  What you would seem to build up! I know no
  Disparity between us: you're an heir,
  Sprung from a noble family; fair, rich, young,
  And every way my equal.

  _Cam._ Sir, excuse me;
  One aerie with proportion ne'er discloses
  The eagle and the wren[146]:--tissue and frieze
  In the same garment, monstrous! But suppose
  That what 's in you excessive were diminish'd,
  And my desert supplied; the stronger bar,
  Religion, stops our entrance: you are, sir,
  A knight of Malta, by your order bound
  To a single life; you cannot marry me;
  And, I assure myself, you are too noble
  To seek me, though my frailty should consent,
  In a base path.

  _Bert._ A dispensation, lady,
  Will easily absolve me.

  _Cam._ O take heed, sir!
  When what is vow'd to heaven is dispensed with,
  To serve our ends on earth, a curse must follow,
  And not a blessing.

  _Bert._ Is there no hope left me?

  _Cam._ Nor to myself, but is a neighbour to
  Impossibility. True love should walk
  On equal feet; in us it does not, sir:
  But rest assured, excepting this, I shall be
  Devoted to your service.

  _Bert._ And this is your
  Determinate sentence?

  _Cam._ Not to be revoked.

  _Bert._ Farewell, then, fairest cruel! all thoughts in me
  Of women perish. Let the glorious light
  Of noble war extinguish Love's dim taper.
  That only lends me light to see my folly:
  Honour, be thou my ever-living mistress,
  And fond affection, as thy bond-slave, serve thee!
                                              [_Exit._

  _Cam._ How soon my sun is set, he being absent,
  Never to rise again! What a fierce battle
  Is fought between my passions!

  _Syl._ I perceive
  He has his answer: now must I step in
  To comfort her. [Comes forward.] You have found, I hope, sweet lady,
  Some difference between a youth of my pitch,
  And this bugbear Bertoldo. Despair not; I
  May be in time entreated.

  _Cam._ Be so now, to leave me.--
  Lights for my chamber! O my heart!
                                     [_Exeunt._


                      ACT II. SCENE I.

             _The same. A Room in the Palace._

_Enter_ ROBERTO, FULGENTIO, _and_ ASTUTIO.

  _Rob._ Embark'd to-night, do you say?

  _Ful._ I saw him aboard, sir.

  _Rob._ And without taking of his leave?

  _Ast._ 'Twas strange!

  _Rob._ Are we grown so contemptible?

  _Ful._ 'Tis far
  From me, sir, to add fuel to your anger,
  That, in your ill opinion of him, burns
  Too hot already; else, I should affirm
  It was a gross neglect.

  _Rob._ A wilful scorn
  Of duty and allegiance; you give it
  Too fair a name: but we shall think on 't. Can you
  Guess what the numbers were, that follow'd him
  In his desperate action?

  _Ful._ More than you think, sir.
  All ill-affected spirits in Palermo,
  Or to your government or person, with
  The turbulent swordmen, such whose poverty forced them
  To wish a change, are gone along with him;
  Creatures devoted to his undertakings,
  In right or wrong: and, to express their zeal
  And readiness to serve him, ere they went,
  Profanely took the sacrament on their knees,
  To live and die with him.

  _Rob._ O most impious!
  Their loyalty to us forgot?

  _Ful._ I fear so.

  _Ast._ Unthankful as they are!

  _Ful._ Yet this deserves not
  One troubled thought in you, sir; with your pardon,
  I hold that their remove from hence makes more
  For your security than danger.

  _Rob._ True;
  And, as I'll fashion it, they shall feel it too.
  Astutio, you shall presently be despatch'd
  With letters, writ and sign'd with our own hand,
  To the duchess of Sienna, in excuse
  Of our part in these forces sent against her.
  You must, beside, from us take some instructions,
  To be imparted, as you judge them useful,
  To the general Gonzaga. Instantly
  Prepare you for your journey.

  _Ast._ With the wings
  Of loyalty and duty.       [_Exit._

  _Ful._ I am bold
  To put your majesty in mind----

  _Rob._ Of my promise,
  And aids, to further you in your amorous project
  To the fair and rich Camiola? there's my ring;
  Whatever you shall say that I entreat,
  Or can command by power, I will make good.

  _Ful._ Ever your majesty's creature.

  _Rob._ Venus prove
  Propitious to you!      [_Exit._

  _Ful._ All sorts to my wishes:
  Bertoldo was my hindrance; he removed,
  I now will court her in the conqueror's style;
  "Come, see, and overcome."--Boy!

_Enter Page._

  _Page._ Sir; your pleasure?

  _Ful._ Haste to Camiola; bid her prepare
  An entertainment suitable to a fortune
  She could not hope for. Tell her, I vouchsafe
  To honour her with a visit.

  _Page._ 'Tis a favour
  Will make her proud.

  _Ful._ I know it.

  _Page._ I am gone, sir.      [_Exit._

  _Ful._ Entreaties fit not me; a man in grace
  May challenge awe and privilege, by his place.      [_Exit._


                          SCENE II.

           _The same. A Room in_ CAMIOLA'_s House_.

_Enter_ ADORNI, SYLLI, _and_ CLARINDA.

  _Ador._ So melancholy, say you!

  _Clar._ Never given
  To such retirement.

  _Ador._ Can you guess the cause?

  _Clar._ If it hath not its birth and being from
  The brave Bertoldo's absence, I confess
  'Tis past my apprehension.

  _Syl._ You are wide,
  The whole field wide[147]. I, in my understanding,
  Pity your ignorance.

  _Ador._ Resolve us.

  _Syl._ Know,
  Here walks the cause. She dares not look upon me;
  My beauties are so terrible and enchanting,
  She cannot endure my sight.

  _Ador._ There I believe you.

  _Syl._ But the time will come, be comforted, when I will
  Put off this vizor of unkindness to her,
  And show an amorous and yielding face:
  And, until then, though Hercules himself
  Desire to see her, he had better eat
  His club, than pass her threshold; for I will be
  Her Cerberus, to guard her.

  _Ador._ A good dog!

  _Clar._ Worth twenty porters.

_Enter Page._

  _Page._ Keep you open house here?
  No groom to attend a gentleman! O, I spy one.

  _Syl._ He means not me, I am sure.

  _Page._ You, sirrah sheep's-head,
  With a face cut on a cat-stick[148], do you hear?
  You, yeoman fewterer[149], conduct me to
  The lady of the mansion, or my poniard
  Shall disembogue thy soul.

  _Syl._ O terrible! _disembogue!_
  I talk'd of Hercules, and here is one
  Bound up in _decimo sexto_.

  _Page._ Answer, wretch.

  _Syl._ Pray you, little gentleman, be not so furious:
  The lady keeps her chamber.

  _Page._ And we present,
  Sent on an embassy to her! but here is
  Her gentlewoman. Sirrah! hold my cloak,
  While I take a leap at her lips: do it, and neatly;
  Or, having first tripp'd up thy heels, I'll make
  Thy back my footstool.           [_Kisses_ CLARINDA.

  _Syl._ Tamberlane in little!
  Am I turn'd Turk[150]! What an office am I put to!

  _Clar._ My lady, gentle youth, is indisposed.

  _Page._ Though she were dead and buried, only tell her,
  The great man in the court, the brave Fulgentio,
  Descends to visit her, and it will raise her
  Out of the grave for joy.

_Enter_ FULGENTIO.

  _Syl._ Here comes another!
  The devil, I fear, in his holiday clothes.

  _Page._ So soon!
  My part is at an end then. Cover my shoulders;
  When I grow great, thou shalt serve me.

  _Ful._ Are you, sirrah,
  An implement of the house?      [_To_ SYLLI.

  _Syl._ Sure he will make
  A jointstool of me!

  _Ful._ Or, if you belong         [_To_ ADOR.
  To the lady of the place, command her hither.

  _Ador._ I do not wear her livery, yet acknowledge
  A duty to her; and as little bound
  To serve your peremptory will, as she is
  To obey your summons. 'Twill become you, sir,
  To wait her leisure; then, her pleasure known,
  You may present your duty.

  _Ful._ Duty! Slave,
  I'll teach you manners.

  _Ador._ I'm past learning; make not
  A tumult in the house.

  _Ful._ Shall I be braved thus?      [_They draw._

  _Clar._ Help! murder!

_Enter_ CAMIOLA.

  _Cam._ What insolence is this? Adorni, hold,
  Hold, I command you.

  _Ful._ Saucy groom!

  _Cam._ Not so, sir;
  However, in his life, he had dependence
  Upon my father, he's a gentleman,
  As well born as yourself. Put on your hat.

  _Ful._ In my presence, without leave!

  _Syl._ He has mine, madam.

  _Cam._ And I must tell you, sir, and in plain language,
  Howe'er your glittering outside promise gentry,
  The rudeness of your carriage and behaviour
  Speaks you a coarser thing.

  _Syl._ She means a clown, sir;
  I am her interpreter, for want of a better.

  _Cam._ I am a queen in mine own house; nor must you
  Expect an empire here.

  _Syl._ Sure I must love her
  Before the day, the pretty soul's so valiant.

  _Cam._ What are you? and what would you with me?

  _Ful._ Proud one,
  When you know what I am, and what I came for,
  And may, on your submission, proceed to,
  You, in your reason, must repent the coarseness
  Of my entertainment.

  _Cam._ Why, fine man? what are you?

  _Ful._ A kinsman of the king's.

  _Cam._ I cry you mercy,
  For his sake, not your own. But, grant you are so,
  'Tis not impossible but a king may have
  A fool to his kinsman,--no way meaning you, sir.

  _Ful._ You have heard of Fulgentio?

  _Cam._ Long since, sir;
  A suit-broker in court. He has the worst
  Report among good men I ever heard of,
  For bribery and extortion: in their prayers,
  Widows and orphans curse him for a canker
  And caterpillar in the state. I hope,
  Sir, you are not the man.

  _Ful._ I reply not
  As you deserve, being assured you know me;
  Pretending ignorance of my person, only
  To give me a taste of your wit: 'tis well, and courtly;
  I like a sharp wit well.

  _Syl._ I cannot endure it;
  Nor any of the Syllis.

  _Ful._ More; I know, too,
  This harsh induction must serve as a foil
  To the well-tuned observance and respect
  You will hereafter pay me, being made
  Familiar with my credit with the king,
  And that (contain your joy) I deign to love you.

  _Cam._ Love me! I am not rapt with it.

  _Ful._ Hear 't again;
  I love you honestly: now you admire me.

  _Cam._ I do, indeed; it being a word so seldom
  Heard from a courtier's mouth. But, pray you, deal plainly,
  Since you find me simple; what might be the motives
  Inducing you to leave the freedom of
  A bachelor's life, on your soft neck to wear
  The stubborn yoke of marriage; and, of all
  The beauties in Palermo, to choose me,
  Poor me? that is the main point you must treat of.

  _Ful._ Why, I will tell you. Of a little thing
  You are a pretty peat[151], indifferent fair too;
  And, like a new-rigg'd ship, both tight and yare:
  Besides, the quickness of your eye assures
  An active spirit.

  _Cam._ You are pleasant, sir;
  Yet I presume that there was one thing in me,
  Unmention'd yet, that took you more than all
  Those parts you have remember'd.

  _Ful._ What?

  _Cam._ My wealth, sir.

  _Ful._ You are in the right; without that, beauty is
  A flower worn in the morning, at night trod on:
  But beauty, youth, and fortune meeting in you,
  I will vouchsafe to marry you.

  _Cam._ You speak well;
  And, in return, excuse me, sir, if I
  Deliver reasons why, upon no terms,
  I'll marry you: I fable not.

  _Syl._ I am glad
  To hear this: I began to have an ague.

  _Ful._ Come, your wise reasons.

  _Cam._ Such as they are, pray take them:
  First, I am doubtful whether you are a man,
  Since, for your shape, trimm'd up in a lady's dressing,
  You might pass for a woman; for the fairness
  Of your complexion, which you think will take me,
  The colour, I must tell you, in a man,
  Is weak and faint, and never will hold out,
  If put to labour: give me the lovely brown,
  A thick curl'd hair of the same die, a leg without
  An artificial calf;--I suspect yours;
  But let that pass.

  _Syl._ She means me all this while,
  For I have every one of those good parts;
  O Sylli! fortunate Sylli!

  _Cam._ You are moved, sir.

  _Ful._ Fie! no; go on.

  _Cam._ Then, as you are a courtier,
  A graced one too, I fear you have been too forward;
  And so much for your person. One word more,
  And I have done.

  _Ful._ I'll ease you of the trouble,
  Coy and disdainful!

  _Cam._ Save me, or else he'll beat me.

  _Ful._ No, your own folly shall; and, since you put me
  To my last charm, look upon this, and tremble.
                          [_Shows the king's ring._

  _Cam._ At the sight of a fair ring! the king's, I take it?
  I have seen him wear the like: if he hath sent it,
  As a favour, to me----

  _Ful._ Yes, 'tis very likely,
  His dying mother's gift, prized as his crown!
  By this he does command you to be mine;
  By his gift you are so:--you may yet redeem all.

  _Cam._ You are in a wrong account still. Though the king may
  Dispose of my life and goods, my mind's mine own,
  And never shall be yours. The king, heaven bless him!
  Is good and gracious, and will not compel
  His subjects against their wills. I believe,
  Forgetting it when he wash'd his hands, you stole it,
  With an intent to awe me. But you are cozen'd;
  I am still myself, and will be.

  _Ful._ A proud haggard[152],
  And not to be reclaim'd! which of your grooms,
  Your coachman, fool, or footman, is the lover
  Preferr'd before me?

  _Cam._ You are foul-mouth'd.

  _Ful._ Much fairer
  Than thy black soul; and so I will proclaim thee.

  _Cam._ Were I a man, thou durst not speak this.

  _Ful._ Heaven
  So prosper me, as I resolve to do it
  To all men, and in every place: scorn'd by
  A tit of ten-pence!      [_Exeunt_ FULGENTIO _and Page_.

  _Syl._ Now I begin to be valiant:
  Nay, I will draw my sword. O for a brother[153]!
  Do a friend's part; pray you, carry him the length of 't.
  I give him three years and a day to match my Toledo,
  And then we'll fight like dragons.

  _Ador._ Pray, have patience.

  _Cam._ I may live to have vengeance: my Bertoldo
  Would not have heard this.

  _Ador._ Madam,----

  _Cam._ Pray you, spare
  Your language. Prithee fool[154], and make me merry.      [_To_ SYLLI.

  _Syl._ That is my office ever.

  _Ador._ I must do,
  Not talk; this glorious gallant shall hear from me.
                                            [_Exeunt._



                         SCENE III.

     _The Siennese. A Camp before the Walls of Sienna._

_Chambers shot off: a Flourish as to an Assault: after which, enter_
GONZAGA, PIERIO, RODERIGO, JACOMO, _and Soldiers_.

  _Gonz._ Is the breach made assaultable?

  _Pier._ Yes, and the moat
  Fill'd up; the cannoneer hath done his parts;
  We may enter six abreast.

  _Rod._ There's not a man
  Dares show himself upon the wall.

  _Jac._ Defeat not
  The soldiers' hoped-for spoil.

  _Pier._ If you, sir,
  Delay the assault, and the city be given up
  To your discretion, you in honour cannot
  Use the extremity of war,--but, in
  Compassion to them, you to us prove cruel.

  _Jac._ And an enemy to yourself.

  _Rod._ A hindrance to
  The brave revenge you have vow'd.

  _Gonz._ Temper your heat,
  And lose not, by too sudden rashness, that
  Which, be but patient, will be offer'd to you.
  Security ushers ruin; proud contempt
  Of an enemy three parts vanquish'd, with desire
  And greediness of spoil, have often wrested
  A certain victory from the conqueror's gripe.
  Discretion is the tutor of the war.
  Valour the pupil; and, when we command
  With lenity, and our direction's follow'd
  With cheerfulness, a prosperous end must crown
  Our works well undertaken.

  _Rod._ Ours are finish'd----

  _Pier._ If we make use of fortune.

  _Gonz._ Her false smiles
  Deprive you of your judgments. The condition
  Of our affairs exacts a double care,
  And, like bifronted Janus, we must look
  Backward, as forward: though a flattering calm
  Bids us urge on, a sudden tempest raised,
  Not feared, much less expected, in our rear,
  May foully fall upon us, and distract us
  To our confusion.--

_Enter a Scout, hastily._

                      Our scout! what brings
  Thy ghastly looks, and sudden speed?

  _Scout._ The assurance
  Of a new enemy.

  _Gonz._ This I foresaw and fear'd.
  What are they, know'st thou?

  _Scout._ They are, by their colours,
  Sicilians, bravely mounted, and the brightness
  Of their rich armours doubly gilded with
  Reflection of the sun.

  _Gonz._ From Sicily?----
  The king in league! no war proclaim'd! 'tis foul:
  But this must be prevented, not disputed.
  Ha! how is this? your estridge[155] plumes, that but
  Even now, like quills of porcupines, seem'd to threaten
  The stars, drop at the rumour of a shower,
  And, like to captive colours, sweep the earth!
  Bear up; but in great dangers, greater minds
  Are never proud. Shall a few loose troops, untrain'd
  But in a customary ostentation,
  Presented as a sacrifice to your valours,
  Cause a dejection in you?

  _Pier._ No dejection.

  _Rod._ However startled, where you lead we'll follow.

  _Gonz._ 'Tis bravely said. We will not stay their charge,
  But meet them man to man, and horse to horse.
  Pierio, in our absence hold our place;
  And with our foot men and those sickly troops
  Prevent a sally: I in mine own person,
  With part of the cavallery, will bid
  These hunters welcome to a bloody breakfast:--
  But I lose time.

  _Pier._ I'll to my charge.      [_Exit._

  _Gonz._ And we
  To ours: I'll bring you on.

  _Jac._ If we come off,
  It's not amiss; if not, my state is settled.
                           [_Exeunt. Alarum within._


FOOTNOTE:

[155] _Estridge_,] i. e. _ostrich_.


                         SCENE IV.

            _The same. The Citadel of Sienna._

_Enter_ FERDINAND, DRUSO, _and_ LIVIO, _on the Walls_.

  _Fer._ No aids from Sicily! Hath hope forsook us;
  And that vain comfort to affliction, pity,
  By our vow'd friend denied us? we can nor live
  Nor die with honour: like beasts in a toil,
  We wait the leisure of the bloody hunter,
  Who is not so far reconciled unto us,
  As in one death to give a period
  To our calamities; but in delaying
  The fate we cannot fly from, starved with wants,
  We die this night, to live again to-morrow,
  And suffer greater torments.

  _Dru._ There is not
  Three days' provision for every soldier,
  At an ounce of bread a day, left in the city.

  _Liv._ To die the beggar's death, with hunger made
  Anatomies while we live, cannot but crack
  Our heart-strings with vexation.

  _Fer._ Would they would break,
  Break altogether! How willingly, like Cato,
  Could I tear out my bowels, rather than
  Look on the conqueror's insulting face;
  But that religion, and the horrid dream
  To be suffer'd in the other world, denies it!

_Enter a Soldier._

  What news with thee?

  _Sold._ From the turret of the fort,
  By the rising clouds of dust, through which, like lightning,
  The splendour of bright arms sometimes brake through,
  I did descry some forces making towards us;
  And, from the camp, as emulous of their glory,
  The general, (for I know him by his horse,)
  And bravely seconded, encounter'd them.
  Their greetings were too rough for friends; their swords,
  And not their tongues, exchanging courtesies.
  By this the main battalias are join'd;
  And, if you please to be spectators of
  The horrid issue, I will bring you where,
  As in a theatre, you may see their fates
  In purple gore presented.

  _Fer._ Heaven, if yet thou art
  Appeased for my wrong done to Aurelia,
  Take pity of my miseries! Lead the way, friend.
                                           [_Exeunt._


                          SCENE V.

             _The same. A Plain near the Camp._

_A long Charge; after which, a Flourish for Victory: then enter_
GONZAGA, JACOMO, _and_ RODERIGO, _wounded_; BERTOLDO, GASPARO, _and_
ANTONIO, _Prisoners. Officers and Soldiers_.

  _Gonz._ We have them yet, though they cost us dear. This was
  Charged home, and bravely follow'd. Be to yourselves
      [_To_ JACOMO _and_ RODERIGO.
  True mirrors to each other's worth; and, looking
  With noble emulation on his wounds,
                                [Points to BERT.
  The glorious livery of triumphant war,
  Imagine these with equal grace appear
  Upon yourselves. The bloody sweat you have suffer'd
  In this laborious, nay, toilsome harvest,
  Yields a rich crop of conquest; and the spoil,
  Most precious balsam to a soldier's hurts,
  Will ease and cure them. Let me look upon
      [GASPARO _and_ ANTONIO _are brought forward_.
  The prisoners' faces. Oh, how much transform'd
  From what they were! O Mars! were these toys fashion'd
  To undergo the burthen of thy service?
  The weight of their defensive armour bruised
  Their weak effeminate limbs, and would have forced them,
  In a hot day, without a blow to yield.

  _Ant._ This insultation shows not manly in you.

  _Gonz._ To men I had forborne it; you are women,
  Or, at the best, loose carpet-knights[156]. What fury
  Seduced you to exchange your ease in court
  For labour in the field? Perhaps you thought
  To charge, through dust and blood, an armed foe,
  Was but like graceful running at the ring
  For a wanton mistress' glove; and the encounter,
  A soft impression on her lips:--but you
  Are gaudy butterflies, and I wrong myself
  In parling with you.

  _Gasp._ _Voe victis!_ now we prove it.

  _Rod._ But here's one fashion'd in another mould,
  And made of tougher metal.

  _Gonz._ True; I owe him
  For this wound bravely given.

  _Bert._ O that mountains
  Were heap'd upon me, that I might expire,
  A wretch no more remember'd!             [_Aside._

  _Gonz._ Look up, sir;
  To be o'ercome deserves no shame. If you
  Had fallen ingloriously, or could accuse
  Your want of courage in resistance, 'twere
  To be lamented: but, since you perform'd
  As much as could be hoped for from a man,
  (Fortune his enemy,) you wrong yourself
  In this dejection. I am honour'd in
  My victory over you; but to have these
  My prisoners, is, in my true judgment, rather
  Captivity than a triumph: you shall find
  Fair quarter from me, and your many wounds,
  Which I hope are not mortal, with such care
  Look'd to and cured, as if your nearest friend
  Attended on you.

  _Bert._ When you know me better,
  You will make void this promise: can you call me
  Into your memory?

  _Gonz._ The brave Bertoldo!
  A brother of our order! By St. John,
  Our holy patron, I am more amazed,
  Nay, thunderstruck with thy apostacy,
  And precipice from the most solemn vows
  Made unto Heaven when this, the glorious badge
  Of our Redeemer, was conferred upon thee
  By the great master, than if I had seen
  A reprobate Jew, an atheist, Turk, or Tartar,
  Baptized in our religion!

  _Bert._ This I look'd for;
  And am resolved to suffer.

  _Gonz._ Fellow-soldiers,
  Behold this man, and, taught by his example,
  Know that 'tis safer far to play with lightning,
  Than trifle in things sacred. In my rage      [_Weeps._
  I shed these at the funeral of his virtue,
  Faith, and religion; why, I will tell you:--
  He was a gentleman so train'd up and fashion'd
  For noble uses, and his youth did promise
  Such certainties, more than hopes, of great achievements,
  As--if the Christian world had stood opposed
  Against the Othoman race, to try the fortune
  Of one encounter--this Bertoldo had been,
  For his knowledge to direct, and matchless courage
  To execute, without a rival, by
  The votes of good men, chosen general;
  As the prime soldier, and most deserving
  Of all that wear the cross: which now, in justice,
  I thus tear from him.

  _Bert._ Let me die with it
  Upon my breast.

  _Gonz._ No; by this thou wert sworn,
  On all occasions, as a knight, to guard
  Weak ladies from oppression, and never
  To draw thy sword against them; whereas thou,
  In hope of gain or glory, when a princess,
  And such a princess as Aurelia is,
  Was dispossess'd by violence of what was
  Her true inheritance, against thine oath
  Hast, to thy uttermost, labour'd to uphold
  Her falling enemy. But thou shalt pay
  A heavy forfeiture, and learn too late,
  Valour employ'd in an ill quarrel turns
  To cowardice, and Virtue then puts on
  Foul Vice's visor. This is that which cancels
  All friendship's bands between us.--Bear them off;
  I will hear no reply: and let the ransom
  Of these, for they are yours, be highly rated.
  In this I do but right, and let it be
  Styled justice, and not wilful cruelty.      [_Exeunt._


FOOTNOTE:

[156] _Carpet-knights._] A term of contempt very frequently used by
      our old writers. _Carpet-knights_ were such as were made on
      occasion of public festivities, marriages, births, &c., in
      contradistinction to those that were created on the field of
      battle, after a victory. They were naturally little regarded by
      the latter; and, indeed, their title had long been given in scorn,
      to effeminate courtiers, favourites, &c.--GIFFORD.


                     ACT III. SCENE I.

      _The same. A Camp before the Walls of Sienna._

_Enter_ GONZAGA, ASTUTIO, RODERIGO, _and_ JACOMO.

  _Gonz._ What I have done, sir, by the law of arms
  I can and will make good.

  _Ast._ I have no commission
  To expostulate the act. These letters speak
  The king my master's love to you, and his
  Vow'd service to the duchess, on whose person
  I am to give attendance.

  _Gonz._ At this instant,
  She's at Fienza: you may spare the trouble
  Of riding thither: I have advertised her
  Of our success, and on what humble terms
  Sienna stands: though presently I can
  Possess it, I defer it, that she may
  Enter her own, and, as she please, dispose of
  The prisoners and the spoil.

  _Ast._ I thank you, sir.
  In the mean time, if I may have your licence,
  I have a nephew, and one once my ward,
  For whose liberties and ransoms I would gladly
  Make composition.

  _Gonz._ They are, as I take it,
  Call'd Gasparo and Antonio.

  _Ast._ The same, sir.

  _Gonz._ For them, you must treat with these; but, for Bertoldo,
  He is mine own: if the king will ransom him,
  He pays down fifty thousand crowns; if not,
  He lives and dies my slave.

  _Ast._ Pray you, a word:      [_Aside to_ GONZ.
  The king will rather thank you to detain him,
  Than give one crown to free him.

  _Gonz._ At his pleasure.
  I'll send the prisoners under guard: my business
  Calls me another way.                    [_Exit._

  _Ast._ My service waits you.
  Now, gentlemen, for this ransom, since you are not
  To be brought lower, there is no evading;
  I'll be your paymaster.

  _Rod._ We desire no better.

  _Ast._ But not a word of what's agreed between us,
  Till I have school'd my gallants.

  _Jac._ I am dumb, sir.

_Enter a Guard, with_ BERTOLDO, ANTONIO, _and_ GASPARO, _in irons_.

  _Bert._ And where removed now? hath the tyrant found out
  Worse usage for us?

  _Ant._ Worse it cannot be.
  My greyhound has fresh straw, and scraps, in his kennel;
  But we have neither.

  _Gasp._ Did I ever think
  To wear such garters on silk stockings? or
  That my too curious appetite, that turn'd
  At the sight of godwits, pheasant, partridge, quails,
  Larks, woodcocks, calver'd salmon[157], as coarse diet,
  Would leap at a mouldy crust?

  _Ant._ And go without it,
  So oft as I do? Oh! how have I jeer'd
  The city entertainment! A huge shoulder
  Of glorious fat ram-mutton, seconded
  With a pair of tame cats or conies, a crab-tart,
  With a worthy loin of veal, and valiant capon,
  Mortified to grow tender!--these I scorn'd,
  From their plentiful horn of abundance, though invited:
  But now I could carry my own stool to a tripe[158],
  And call their chitterlings charity, and bless the founder.

  _Bert._ O that I were no further sensible
  Of my miseries than you are! you, like beasts,
  Feel only stings of hunger, and complain not
  But when you're empty: but your narrow souls
  (If you have any) cannot comprehend
  How insupportable the torments are,
  Which a free and noble soul, made captive, suffers.
  Most miserable men!--and what am I, then,
  That envy you? Fetters, though made of gold,
  Express base thraldom; and all delicates
  Prepared by Median cooks for epicures,
  When not our own, are bitter: quilts fill'd high
  With gossamere and roses cannot yield
  The body soft repose, the mind kept waking
  With anguish and affliction.

  _Ast._ My good lord----

  _Bert._ This is no time nor place for flattery, sir:
  Pray you, style me as I am, a wretch forsaken
  Of the world, as myself.

  _Ast._ I would it were
  In me to help you.

  _Bert._ If that you want power, sir,
  Lip-comfort cannot cure me. Pray you, leave me
  To mine own private thoughts.       [_Walks by._

  _Ast._ [_comes forward._] My valiant nephew!
  And my more than warlike ward! I am glad to see you,
  After your glorious conquests. Are these chains
  Rewards for your good service? if they are,
  You should wear them on your necks, since they are massy,
  Like aldermen of the war.

  _Ant._ You jeer us too!

  _Gasp._ Good uncle, name not, as you are a man of honour,
  That fatal word of war; the very sound of it
  Is more dreadful than a cannon.

  _Ant._ But redeem us
  From this captivity, and I'll vow hereafter
  Never to wear a sword, or cut my meat
  With a knife that has an edge or point; I'll starve first.

  _Ast._ Well, have more wit hereafter: for this time
  You are ransom'd.

  _Jac._ Off with their irons!

  _Rod._ Do, do:
  If you are ours again, you know your price.

  _Ant._ Pray you, despatch us: I shall ne'er believe
  I am a free man, till I set my foot
  In Sicily again, and drink Palermo,
  And in Palermo too.

  _Ast._ The wind sits fair;
  You shall aboard to-night: with the rising sun
  You may touch upon the coast. But take your leaves
  Of the late general first.

  _Gasp._ I will be brief.

  _Ant._ And I. My lord, Heaven keep you!

  _Gasp._ Yours, to use
  In the way of peace; but as your soldiers, never.

  _Ant._ A pox of war! no more of war.
              [_Exeunt_ ROD. JAC. ANT. _and_ GASP.

  _Bert._ Have you
  Authority to loose their bonds, yet leave
  The brother of your king, whose worth disdains
  Comparison with such as these, in irons?
  If ransom may redeem them, I have lands,
  A patrimony of mine own, assign'd me
  By my deceased sire, to satisfy
  Whate'er can be demanded for my freedom.

  _Ast._ I wish you had, sir; but the king, who yields
  No reason for his will, in his displeasure
  Hath seized on all you had; nor will Gonzaga,
  Whose prisoner now you are, accept of less
  Than fifty thousand crowns.

  _Bert._ I find it now,
  That misery never comes alone. But, grant
  The king is yet inexorable, time
  May work him to a feeling of my sufferings.
  I have friends that swore their lives and fortunes were
  At my devotion, and, among the rest,
  Yourself, my lord, when forfeited to the law
  For a foul murder, and in cold blood done,
  I made your life my gift, and reconciled you
  To this incensed king, and got your pardon.
  --Beware ingratitude! I know you are rich,
  And may pay down the sum.

  _Ast._ I might, my lord;
  But pardon me.

  _Bert._ And will Astutio prove, then,
  To please a passionate man, (the king's no more,)
  False to his maker, and his reason, which
  Commands more than I ask? O summer friendship,
  Whose flattering leaves, that shadow'd us in our
  Prosperity, with the least gust drop off
  In the autumn of adversity! How like
  A prison is to a grave! when dead, we are
  With solemn pomp brought thither, and our heirs,
  Masking their joy in false dissembled tears,
  Weep o'er the herse; but earth no sooner covers
  The earth brought thither, but they turn away,
  With inward smiles, the dead no more remember'd:
  So, enter'd in a prison----

  _Ast._ My occasions
  Command me hence, my lord.

  _Bert._ Pray you, leave me, do;
  And tell the cruel king, that I will wear
  These fetters till my flesh and they are one
  Incorporated substance. [_Exit_ ASTUTIO.] In myself,
  As in a glass, I'll look on human frailty,
  And curse the height of royal blood; since I,
  In being born near to Jove, am near his thunder[159].
  Cedars once shaken with a storm, their own
  Weight grubs their roots out.--Lead me where you please;
  I am his, not fortune's martyr, and will die
  The great example of his cruelty.      [_Exit guarded._



                          SCENE II.

             _Palermo. A Grove near the Palace._

_Enter_ ADORNI.

  _Ador._ He undergoes my challenge, and contemns it,
  And threatens me with the late edict made
  'Gainst duellists,--the altar cowards fly to.
  But I, that am engaged, and nourish in me
  A higher aim than fair Camiola dreams of,
  Must not sit down thus. In the court I dare not
  Attempt him; and in public he's so guarded,
  With a herd of parasites, clients, fools, and suitors,
  That a musket cannot reach him:--my designs
  Admit of no delay. This is her birthday,
  Which, with a fit and due solemnity,
  Camiola celebrates: and on it, all such
  As love or serve her usually present
  A tributary duty. I'll have something
  To give, if my intelligence prove true,
  Shall find acceptance. I am told, near this grove
  Fulgentio, every morning, makes his markets
  With his petitioners; I may present him
  With a sharp petition!----Ha! 'tis he: my fate
  Be ever bless'd for 't!

_Enter_ FULGENTIO _and Page_.

  _Ful._ Command such as wait me
  Not to presume, at the least for half an hour,
  To press on my retirements. Begone, sir.
                                     [_Exit Page._
  Challenged! 'tis well; and by a groom! still better.
  Was this shape made to fight? I have a tongue yet,
  Howe'er no sword, to kill him; and what way,
  This morning I'll resolve of.            [_Exit._

  _Ador._ I shall cross
  Your resolution, or suffer for you.
                                 [_Exit following him._


                         SCENE III.

          _The same. A Room in_ CAMIOLA'_s House_.

_Enter_ CAMIOLA, _followed by Servants with Presents_; SYLLI, _and_
CLARINDA.

  _Syl._ What are all these?

  _Clar._ Servants with several presents,
  And rich ones too.

  _1 Serv._ With her best wishes, madam,
  Of many such days to you, the lady Petula
  Presents you with this fan.

  _2 Serv._ This diamond,
  From your aunt Honoria.

  _3 Serv._ This piece of plate
  From your uncle, old Vicentio, with your arms
  Graven upon it.

  _Cam._ Good friends, they are too
  Munificent in their love and favour to me.
  Out of my cabinet return such jewels
  As this directs you:--[_To_ CLARINDA.]--for your pains; and yours;
  Nor must you be forgotten. [_Gives them money._] Honour me
  With the drinking of a health.

  _1 Serv._ Gold, on my life!

  _2 Serv._ She scorns to give base silver.

  _3 Serv._ Would she had been
  Born every month in the year!

  _1 Serv._ Month! every day.

  _2 Serv._ Show such another maid.

  _3 Serv._ All happiness wait you!

  _Clar._ I'll see your will done.
           [_Exeunt_ SYLLI, CLARINDA, _and Servants_.

_Enter_ ADORNI _wounded_.

  _Cam._ How, Adorni wounded!

  _Ador._ A scratch got in your service, else not worth
  Your observation: I bring not, madam,
  In honour of your birthday, antique plate,
  Or pearl, for which the savage Indian dives
  Into the bottom of the sea; nor diamonds
  Hewn from steep rocks with danger. Such as give
  To those that have, what they themselves want, aim at
  A glad return with profit: yet, despise not
  My offering at the altar of your favour;
  Nor let the lowness of the giver lessen
  The height of what's presented; since it is
  A precious jewel, almost forfeited,
  And dimm'd with clouds of infamy, redeem'd,
  And, in its natural splendour, with addition
  Restored to the true owner.

  _Cam._ How is this?

  _Ador._ Not to hold you in suspense, I bring you, madam,
  Your wounded reputation cured, the sting
  Of virulent malice, festering your fair name,
  Pluck'd out and trod on. That proud man, that was
  Denied the honour of your hand, yet durst,
  With his untrue reports, revile your fame,
  Compell'd by me, hath given himself the lie,
  And in his own blood wrote it:--you may read
  Fulgentio subscribed.         [_Offering a paper._

  _Cam._ I am amazed!

  _Ador._ It does deserve it, madam. Common service
  Is fit for hinds, and the reward proportion'd
  To their conditions: therefore, look not on me
  As a follower of your father's fortunes, or
  One that subsists on yours:--you frown! my service
  Merits not this aspéct.

  _Cam._ Which of my favours,
  I might say bounties, hath begot and nourish'd
  This more than rude presumption? Since you had
  An itch to try your desperate valour, wherefore
  Went you not to the war? Couldst thou suppose
  My innocence could ever fall so low
  As to have need of thy rash sword to guard it
  Against malicious slander? O how much
  Those ladies are deceived and cheated, when
  The clearness and integrity of their actions
  Do not defend themselves, and stand secure
  On their own bases! Such as in a colour
  Of seeming service give protection to them,
  Betray their own strengths. Malice scorn'd, puts out
  Itself; but argued, gives a kind of credit
  To a false accusation. In this, this your
  Most memorable service, you believed
  You did me right; but you have wrong'd me more
  In your defence of my undoubted honour,
  Than false Fulgentio could.

  _Ador._ I am sorry what was
  So well intended is so ill received;

_Re-enter_ CLARINDA.

  Yet, under your correction, you wish'd
  Bertoldo had been present.

  _Cam._ True, I did:
  But he and you, sir, are not parallels,
  Nor must you think yourself so.

  _Ador._ I am what
  You'll please to have me.

  _Cam._ If Bertoldo had
  Punish'd Fulgentio's insolence, it had shown
  His love to her whom, in his judgment, he
  Vouchsafed to make his wife; a height, I hope,
  Which you dare not aspire to. The same actions
  Suit not all men alike;--but I perceive
  Repentance in your looks. For this time, leave me;
  I may forgive, perhaps forget, your folly:
  Conceal yourself till this storm be blown over.
  You will be sought for; yet, if my estate
                      [_Gives him her hand to kiss._
  Can hinder it, shall not suffer in my service.
                                       [_Exit_ ADORNI.
  This gentleman is of a noble temper;
  And I too harsh, perhaps, in my reproof:
  Was I not, Clarinda?

  _Clar._ I am not to censure
  Your actions, madam; but there are a thousand
  Ladies, and of good fame, in such a cause
  Would be proud of such a servant.

  _Cham._ It may be;

_Enter a Servant._

  Let me offend in this kind. Why, uncall'd for?

  _Serv._ The signiors, madam, Gasparo and Antonio,
  Selected friends of the renown'd Bertoldo,
  Put ashore this morning.

  _Cam._ Without him?

  _Serv._ I think so.

  _Cam._ Never think more then.

  _Serv._ They have been at court,
  Kiss'd the king's hand; and, their first duties done
  To him, appear ambitious to tender
  To you their second service.

  _Cam._ Wait them hither.      [_Exit Servant._
  Fear, do not rack me! Reason, now, if ever,
  Haste with thy aids, and tell me, such a wonder
  As my Bertoldo is, with such care fashion'd,
  Must not, nay, cannot, in Heaven's providence

_Enter_ ANTONIO _and_ GASPARO.

  So soon miscarry!--pray you, forbear; ere you take
  The privilege, as strangers, to salute me,
  (Excuse my manners,) make me first understand
  How it is with Bertoldo.

  _Gasp._ The relation
  Will not, I fear, deserve your thanks.

  _Ant._ I wish
  Some other should inform you.

  _Cam._ Is he dead?
  You see, though with some fear, I dare inquire it.

  _Gasp._ Dead! Would that were the worst; a debt were paid then,
  Kings in their birth owe nature.

  _Cam._ Is there aught
  More terrible than death?

  _Ant._ Yes, to a spirit
  Like his; cruel imprisonment, and that
  Without the hope of freedom.

  _Cam._ You abuse me[160]:
  The royal king cannot, in love to virtue,
  (Though all springs of affection were dried up,)
  But pay his ransom.

  _Gasp._ When you know what 'tis,
  You will think otherwise: no less will do it
  Than fifty thousand crowns.

  _Cam._ A petty sum,
  The price weigh'd with the purchase: fifty thousand!
  To the king 'tis nothing. He that can spare more
  To his minion for a masque, cannot but ransom
  Such a brother at a million. You wrong
  The king's magnificence.

  _Ant._ In your opinion;
  But 'tis most certain: he does not alone
  In himself refuse to pay it, but forbids
  All other men.

  _Cam._ Are you sure of this?

  _Gasp._ You may read
  The edict to that purpose, publish'd by him;
  That will resolve you.

  _Cam._ Possible! pray you, stand off.
  If I do not mutter treason to myself,
  My heart will break; and yet I will not curse him;
  He is my king. The news you have deliver'd
  Makes me weary of your company; we'll salute
  When we meet next. I'll bring you to the door.
  Nay, pray you, no more compliments.

  _Gasp._ One thing more,
  And that's substantial: let your Adorni
  Look to himself.

  _Ant._ The king is much incensed
  Against him for Fulgentio.

  _Cam._ As I am,
  For your slowness to depart.

  _Both._ Farewell, sweet lady.
                 [_Exeunt_ GASPARO _and_ ANTONIO.

  _Cam._ O more than impious times! when not alone
  Subordinate ministers of justice are
  Corrupted and seduced, but kings themselves,
  The greater wheels by which the lesser move,
  Are broken, or disjointed! could it be, else,
  A king, to sooth his politic ends, should so far
  Forsake his honour, as at once to break
  The adamant chains of nature and religion,
  To bind up atheism[161], as a defence
  To his dark counsels? Will it ever be,
  That to deserve too much is dangerous,
  And virtue, when too eminent, a crime?
  Must she serve fortune still, or, when stripp'd of
  Her gay and glorious favours, lose the beauties
  Of her own natural shape? O, my Bertoldo,
  Thou only sun in honour's sphere, how soon
  Art thou eclipsed and darken'd! not the nearness
  Of blood prevailing on the king; nor all
  The benefits to the general good dispensed,
  Gaining a retribution! But that
  To owe a courtesy to a simple virgin
  Would take from the deserving, I find in me
  Some sparks of fire, which, fann'd with honour's breath,
  Might rise into a flame, and in men darken
  Their usurp'd splendour. Ha! my aim is high,
  And, for the honour of my sex, to fall so,
  Can never prove inglorious.--'Tis resolved:
  Call in Adorni.

  _Clar._ I am happy in
  Such an employment, madam.      [_Exit._

  _Cam._ He's a man,
  I know, that at a reverent distance loves me;
  And such are ever faithful. What a sea
  Of melting ice I walk on! what strange censures
  Am I to undergo! but good intents
  Deride all future rumours.

_Re-enter_ CLARINDA _with_ ADORNI.

  _Ador._ I obey
  Your summons, madam.

  _Cam._ Leave the place, Clarinda;
  One woman, in a secret of such weight,
  Wise men may think too much: [_Exit_ CLARINDA.] nearer, Adorni.
  I warrant it with a smile.

  _Ador._ I cannot ask
  Safer protection; what's your will?

  _Cam._ To doubt
  Your ready desire to serve me, or prepare you
  With the repetition of former merits,
  Would, in my diffidence, wrong you: but I will,
  And without circumstance, in the trust that I
  Impose upon you, free you from suspicion.

  _Ador._ I foster none of you.

  _Cam._ I know you do not.
  You are, Adorni, by the love you owe me----

  _Ador._ The surest conjuration.

  _Cam._ Take me with you[162].--
  Love born of duty; but advance no further.
  You are, sir, as I said, to do me service,
  To undertake a task, in which your faith,
  Judgment, discretion--in a word, your all
  That's good, must be engaged; nor must you study,
  In the execution, but what may make
  For the ends I aim at.

  _Ador._ They admit no rivals.

  _Cam._ You answer well. You have heard of Bertoldo's
  Captivity, and the king's neglect; the greatness
  Of his ransom; fifty thousand crowns, Adorni;
  Two parts of my estate!

  _Ador._ To what tends this?      [_Aside._

  _Cam._ Yet I so love the gentleman, for to you
  I will confess my weakness, that I purpose
  Now, when he is forsaken by the king,
  And his own hopes, to ransom him, and receive him
  Into my bosom, as my lawful husband--
  Why change you colour?

  _Ador._ 'Tis in wonder of
  Your virtue, madam.

  _Cam._ You must, therefore, to
  Sienna for me, and pay to Gonzaga
  This ransom for his liberty; you shall have
  Bills of exchange along with you. Let him swear
  A solemn contract to me; for you must be
  My principal witness, if he should--but why
  Do I entertain these jealousies? You will do this?

  _Ador._ Faithfully, madam--but not live long after.      [_Aside._

  _Cam._ One thing I had forgot: besides his freedom,
  He may want accomodations; furnish him
  According to his birth.
  I'll instantly despatch you.           [_Exit._

  _Ador._ Was there ever
  Poor lover so employ'd against himself,
  To make way for his rival? I must do it,
  Nay, more, I will. If loyalty can find
  Recompense beyond hope or imagination,
  Let it fall on me in the other world,
  As a reward, for in this I dare not hope it.      [_Exit._



                    ACT IV. SCENE I.

   _The Siennese. A Camp before the Walls of Sienna._

_Enter_ GONZAGA _and_ PIERIO.

  _Gonz._ You have seized upon the citadel, and disarm'd
  All that could make resistance?

  _Pier._ Hunger had
  Done that, before we came; nor was the soldier
  Compell'd to seek for prey: the famish'd wretches,
  In hope of mercy, as a sacrifice offer'd
  All that was worth the taking.

  _Gonz._ Where is the duke of Urbin?

  _Pier._ Under guard,
  As you directed.

  _Gonz._ See the soldiers set
  In rank and file, and, as the duchess passes,
  Bid them vail their ensigns.

_Loud music. Enter_ RODERIGO, JACOMO, _and_ AURELIA _under a Canopy_.
ASTUTIO _presents her with letters_.

  _Aurel._ But for these aids from Sicily sent against us,
  To blast our spring of conquest in the bud;
  I cannot find, my lord ambassador,
  How we should entertain 't but as a wrong,
  With purpose to detain us from our own,
  Howe'er the king endeavours, in his letters,
  To mitigate the affront.

  _Ast._ Your grace hereafter
  May hear from me such strong assurances
  Of his unlimited desires to serve you,
  As will, I hope, drown in forgetfulness
  The memory of what's past.

  _Aurel._ We shall take time
  To search the depth of 't further, and proceed
  As our council shall direct us.

  _Gonz._ We present you
  With the keys of the city; all lets are removed,
  Your way is smooth and easy; at your feet
  Your proudest enemy falls.

  _Aurel._ We thank your valours:
  A victory without blood is twice achieved,
  And the disposure of it, to us tender'd,
  The greatest honour. Worthy captains, thanks!
  My love extends itself to all.

  _Gonz._ Make way there.
   [_A Guard drawn up_; AURELIA _passes through them_. _Loud music._
      [_Exeunt._


                          SCENE II.

              _Sienna. A Room in the Prison._

BERTOLDO _is discovered in fetters, reading_.

  _Bert._ 'Tis here determined, (great examples, arm'd
  With arguments, produced to make it good,)
  That neither tyrants, nor the wrested laws,
  The people's frantic rage, sad exile, want,
  Nor that which I endure, captivity,
  Can do a wise man any injury.
  Thus Seneca, when he wrote it, thought.--But then
  Felicity courted him; his wealth exceeding
  A private man's; happy in the embraces
  Of his chaste wife Paulina; his house full
  Of children, clients, servants, flattering friends,
  Soothing his lip-positions; and created
  Prince of the senate, by the general voice,
  At his new pupil's suffrage: then, no doubt,
  He held, and did believe, this. But no sooner
  The prince's frowns and jealousies had thrown him
  Out of security's lap, and a centurion
  Had offer'd him what choice of death he pleased,
  But told him, die he must; when straight the armour
  Of his so boasted fortitude fell off,
                             [_Throws away the book._
  Complaining of his frailty. Can it then
  Be censured womanish weakness in me, if,
  Thus clogg'd with irons, and the period
  To close up all calamities denied me,
  Which was presented Seneca, I wish
  I ne'er had being; at least, never knew
  What happiness was; or argue with heaven's justice,
  Tearing my locks, and, in defiance, throwing
  Dust in the air? or, falling on the ground, thus
  With my nails and teeth to dig a grave, or rend
  The bowels of the earth, my step-mother,
  And not a natural parent? or thus practise
  To die, and, as I were insensible,
  Believe I had no motion?        [_Falls on his face._

_Enter_ GONZAGA, ADORNI, _and Gaoler_.

  _Gonz._ There he is:
  I'll not inquire by whom his ransom's paid,
  I am satisfied that I have it; nor allege
  One reason to excuse his cruel usage,
  As you may interpret it: let it suffice
  It was my will to have it so. He is yours now,
  Dispose of him as you please.              [_Exit._

  _Ador._ Howe'er I hate him,
  As one preferr'd before me, being a man,
  He does deserve my pity. Sir!--he sleeps:--
  Or he is dead?--[_kneels by him._]--No, he breathes! Come near,
  And, if 't be possible, without his feeling,
  Take off his irons.--[_His irons taken off._]--So;
      now leave us private.          [_Exit Gaoler._
  He does begin to stir; and, as transported
  With a joyful dream, how he stares! and feels his legs,
  As yet uncertain whether it can be
  True or fantastical.

  _Bert._ [_rising._] Ministers of mercy,
  Mock not calamity. Ha! 'tis no vision!
  Or, if it be, the happiest that ever
  Appear'd to sinful flesh! Who's here? his face
  Speaks him Adorni;--but some glorious angel,
  Concealing its divinity in his shape,
  Hath done this miracle, it being not an act
  For wolfish man. Resolve me, if thou look'st for
  Bent knees in adoration?

  _Ador._ O forbear, sir!
  I am Adorni, and the instrument
  Of your deliverance; but the benefit
  You owe another.

  _Bert._ If he has a name,
  As soon as spoken, 'tis writ on my heart
  I am his bondman.

  _Ador._ To the shame of men,
  This great act is a woman's.

  _Bert._ The whole sex
  For her sake must be deified. How I wander
  In my imagination, yet cannot
  Guess who this phoenix should be!

  _Ador._ 'Tis Camiola.

  _Bert._ Pray you, speak 't again; there's music in her name.
  Once more, I pray you, sir.

  _Ador._ Camiola,
  The MAID OF HONOUR.

  _Bert._ Cursed atheist that I was,
  Only to doubt it could be any other;
  Since she alone, in the abstract of herself,
  That small, but ravishing substance, comprehends
  Whatever is, or can be wish'd, in the
  Idea of a woman! O what service,
  Or sacrifice of duty, can I pay her,
  If not to live and die her charity's slave,
  Which is resolved already!

  _Ador._ She expects not
  Such a dominion o'er you. You must now,
  Which is the sum of all that she desires,
  By a solemn contract bind yourself, when she
  Requires it, as a debt due for your freedom,
  To marry her.

  _Bert._ This does engage me further;
  A payment! an increase of obligation.
  To marry her!--'twas my _nil ultra_ ever:
  The end of my ambition. O that now
  The holy man, she present, were prepared
  To join our hands, but with that speed my heart
  Wishes mine eyes might see her!

  _Ador._ You must swear this.

  _Bert._ False to Camiola! never.--Shall I now
  Begin my vows to you?

  _Ador._ I am no churchman;
  Such a one must file it on record: you are free;
  And, that you may appear like to yourself,
  (For so she wish'd,) here's gold, with which you may
  Redeem your trunks and servants, and whatever
  Of late you lost. I have found out the captain
  Whose spoil they were; his name is Roderigo.

  _Bert._ I know him.

  _Ador._ I have done my parts.

  _Bert._ So much, sir,
  As I am ever yours for 't. Now, methinks,
  I walk in air! Divine Camiola----
  But words cannot express thee: I'll build to thee
  An altar in my soul, on which I'll offer
  A still-increasing sacrifice of duty.       [_Exit._

  _Ador._ What will become of me now is apparent.
  This Roman resolution of self-murder
  Will not hold water at the high tribunal,
  When it comes to be argued; my good Genius
  Prompts me to this consideration. He
  That kills himself to avoid misery, fears it,
  And, at the best, shows but a bastard valour.
  This life's a fort committed to my trust,
  Which I must not yield up till it be forced:
  Nor will I. He's not valiant that dares die,
  But he that boldly bears calamity.         [_Exit._


                         SCENE III.

          _The same. A State-room in the Palace._

_A Flourish. Enter_ PIERIO, RODERIGO, JACOMO, GONZAGA, AURELIA,
FERDINAND, ASTUTIO, _and Attendants_.

  _Aurel._ A seat here for the duke. It is our glory
  To overcome with courtesies, not rigour;
  The lordly Roman, who held it the height
  Of human happiness to have kings and queens
  To wait by his triumphant chariot-wheels,
  In his insulting pride, deprived himself
  Of drawing near the nature of the gods,
  Best known for such, in being merciful.
  Yet, give me leave, but still with gentle language,
  And with the freedom of a friend, to tell you,
  To seek by force, what courtship could not win,
  Was harsh, and never taught in Love's mild school.
  Wise poets feign that Venus' coach is drawn
  By doves and sparrows, not by bears and tigers.
  I spare the application.

  _Fer._ In my fortune,
  Heaven's justice hath confirm'd it; yet, great lady,
  Since my offence grew from excess of love,
  And not to be resisted, having paid, too,
  With loss of liberty, the forfeiture
  Of my presumption, in your clemency
  It may find pardon.

  _Aurel._ You shall have just cause
  To say it hath. The charge of the long siege
  Defray'd, and the loss my subjects have sustain'd
  Made good, since so far I must deal with caution,
  You have your liberty.

  _Fer._ I could not hope for
  Gentler conditions.

  _Aurel._ My lord Gonzaga,
  Since my coming to Sienna, I've heard much of
  Your prisoner, brave Bertoldo.

  _Gonz._ Such an one,
  Madam, I had.

  _Ast._ And have still, sir, I hope.

  _Gonz._ Your hopes deceive you. He is ransom'd, madam.

  _Ast._ By whom, I pray you, sir?

  _Gonz._ You had best inquire
  Of your intelligencer: I am no informer.

  _Ast._ I like not this.            [_Aside._

  _Aurel._ He is, as 'tis reported,
  A goodly gentleman, and of noble parts;
  A brother of your order.

  _Gonz._ He was, madam,
  Till he, against his oath, wrong'd you, a princess,
  Which his religion bound him from.

  _Aurel._ Great minds,
  For trial of their valours, oft maintain
  Quarrels that are unjust, yet without malice;
  And such a fair construction I make of him:
  I would see that brave enemy.

  _Gonz._ My duty
  Commands me to seek for him.

  _Aurel._ Pray you do;
  And bring him to our presence.      [_Exit_ GONZAGA.

  _Ast._ I must blast
  His entertainment. [_Aside._] May it please your excellency.
  He is a man debauch'd, and, for his riots,
  Cast off by the king my master; and that, I hope, is
  A crime sufficient.

  _Fer._ To you, his subjects,
  That like as your king likes.

  _Aurel._ But not to us;
  We must weigh with our own scale.

_Re-enter_ GONZAGA, _with_ BERTOLDO _richly habited, and_ ADORNI.

                                 This is he, sure.
  How soon mine eye had found him! what a port
  He bears! how well his bravery becomes him!
  A prisoner! nay, a princely suitor, rather!
  But I'm too sudden.                        [_Aside._

  _Gonz._ Madam, 'twas his suit,
  Unsent for, to present his service to you,
  Ere his departure.

  _Aurel._ With what majesty
  He bears himself!                             [_Aside._

  _Ast._ The devil, I think, supplies him.
  Ransom'd, and thus rich too!

  _Aurel._ You ill deserve
            [BERTOLDO, _kneeling, kisses her hand_.
  The favour of our hand----we are not well,
  Give us more air.          [_Descends suddenly._

  _Gonz._ What sudden qualm is this?

  _Aurel._--That lifted yours against me.

  _Bert._ Thus, once more,
  I sue for pardon.

  _Aurel._ Sure his lips are poison'd,
  And through these veins force passage to my heart,
  Which is already seized on.                [_Aside._

  _Bert._ I wait, madam,
  To know what your commands are; my designs
  Exact me in another place.

  _Aurel._ Before
  You have our licence to depart! If manners,
  Civility of manners, cannot teach you
  To attend our leisure, I must tell you, sir,
  That you are still our prisoner; nor had you
  Commission to free him.

  _Gonz._ How's this, madam?

  _Aurel._ You were my substitute, and wanted power,
  Without my warrant, to dispose of him:
  I will pay back his ransom ten times over,
  Rather than quit my interest.

  _Bert._ This is
  Against the law of arms.

  _Aurel._ But not of love.                [_Aside._
  Why, hath your entertainment, sir, been such,
  In your restraint, that, with the wings of fear,
  You would fly from it?

  _Bert._ I know no man, madam,
  Enamour'd of his fetters, or delighting
  In cold or hunger, or that would in reason
  Prefer straw in a dungeon before
  A down-bed in a palace.

  _Aurel._ How!--Come nearer:
  Was his usage such?

  _Gonz._ Yes, and it had been worse,
  Had I foreseen this.

  _Aurel._ O such as thou, that have
  No share in nature's bounties, know no pity
  To such as have them. Look on him with my eyes,
  And answer, then, whether this were a man
  Whose cheeks of lovely fulness should be made
  A prey to meagre famine? or these eyes,
  Whose every glance store Cupid's emptied quiver,
  To be dimm'd with tedious watching? or these lips,
  These ruddy lips, of whose fresh colour cherries
  And roses were but copies, should grow pale
  For want of nectar? or these limbs, that bear
  A burthen of more worth than is supported
  By Atlas' wearied shoulders, should be cramp'd
  With the weight of iron? O, I could dwell ever
  On this description!

  _Bert._ Is this in derision,
  Or pity of me?

  _Aurel._ In your charity
  Believe me innocent. Now you are my prisoner,
  You shall have fairer quarter: you will shame
  The place where you have been, should you now leave it,
  Before you are recover'd. I'll conduct you
  To more convenient lodgings, and it shall be
  My care to cherish you. Repine who dare;
  It is our will. You'll follow me?

  _Bert._ To the centre,
  Such a Sybilla guiding me.
     [_Exeunt_ AURELIA, BERTOLDO, _and Attendants_.

  _Gonz._ Who speaks first?

  _Fer._ We stand as we had seen Medusa's head.

  _Pier._ I know not what to think, I am so amazed.

  _Rod._ Amazed! I am thunderstruck.

  _Jac._ We are enchanted,
  And this is some illusion.

  _Ador._ Heaven forbid!
  In dark despair it shows a beam of hope:
  Contain thy joy, Adorni.                 [_Aside._

  _Ast._ Such a princess,
  And of so long experienced reservedness,
  Break forth, and on the sudden, into flashes
  Of more than doubted love!

  _Gonz._ They come again,
  Smiling, as I live!--Some fury hath possess'd her.
  If I speak, I may be blasted.

_Re-enter_ BERTOLDO _and_ AURELIA.

  _Aurel._ Let not, sir,
  The violence of my passion nourish in you
  An ill opinion; or, grant my carriage
  Out of the road and garb of private women,
  'Tis still done with decorum.

  _Bert._ Gracious madam,
  Vouchsafe a little pause; for I am so rapt
  Beyond myself, that, till I have collected
  My scatter'd faculties, I cannot tender
  My resolution.

  _Aurel._ Consider of it:
  I will not be long from you.
                       [BERTOLDO _walks by musing_.

  _Gonz._ Pray you, fair lady,
  If you can, in courtesy direct me to
  The chaste Aurelia.

  _Aurel._ Are you blind? who are we?

  _Gonz._ Another kind of thing. Her love was govern'd
  By her discretion, and not ruled her reason:
  The reverence and majesty of Juno
  Shined in her looks, and, coming to the camp,
  Appear'd a second Pallas. I can see
  No such divinities in you: if I,
  Without offence, may speak my thoughts, you are,
  As 'twere, another Helen.

  _Aurel._ Good! ere long
  You shall know me better.

  _Gonz._ Why, if you are Aurelia,
  How shall I dispose of the soldier?

  _Ast._ May it please you
  To hasten my despatch?

  _Aurel._ Prefer your suits
  Unto Bertoldo; we will give him hearing,
  And you'll find him your best advocate.      [_Exit._

  _Ast._ This is rare!

  _Gonz._ What are we come to?

  _Rod._ Grown up in a moment
  A favourite!

  _Ferd._ He does take state already.

  _Bert._ No, no; it cannot be:--yet, but Camiola,
  There is no step between me and a crown.
  Then my ingratitude! a sin in which
  All sins are comprehended! Aid me, Virtue,
  Or I am lost!

  _Gonz._ May it please your excellence----
  Second me, sir.

  _Bert._ Then my so horrid oaths,
  And hell-deep imprecations made against it!

  _Ast._ The king, your brother, will thank you for the advancement
  Of his affairs.

  _Bert._ And yet who can hold out
  Against such batteries as her power and greatness
  Raise up against my weak defences?

  _Gonz._ Sir,

_Re-enter_ AURELIA.

  Do you dream waking? 'Slight, she's here again!
  Walks she on woollen feet[163]!

  _Aurel._ You dwell too long
  In your deliberation, and come
  With a cripple's pace to that which you should fly to.

  _Bert._ It is confess'd: yet why should I, to win
  From you, that hazard all to my poor nothing,
  By false play send you off a loser from me?
  I am already too, too much engaged
  To the king my brother's anger; and who knows
  But that his doubts and politic fears, should you
  Make me his equal, may draw war upon
  Your territories? Were that breach made up,
  I should with joy embrace what now I fear
  To touch but with due reverence.

  _Aurel._ That hinderance
  Is easily removed. I owe the king
  For a royal visit, which I straight will pay him;
  And having first reconciled you to his favour,
  A dispensation shall meet with us.

  _Bert._ I am wholly yours.

  _Aurel._ On this book seal it.

  _Gonz._ What, hand and lip too! then the bargain's sure.----
  You have no employment for me?

  _Aurel._ Yes, Gonzaga;
  Provide a royal ship.

  _Gonz._ A ship! St. John,
  Whither are we bound now?

  _Aurel._ You shall know hereafter.
  My lord, your pardon for my too much trenching
  Upon your patience.

  _Ador._ Camiola!      [_Aside to_ BERTOLDO.

  _Aurel._ How do you?

  _Bert._ Indisposed; but I attend you.
                               [_Exeunt all but_ ADORNI.

  _Ador._ The heavy curse that waits on perjury
  And foul ingratitude pursue thee ever!
  Yet why from me this? in his breach of faith
  My loyalty finds reward: what poisons him,
  Proves mithridate[164] to me. I have perform'd
  All she commanded, punctually; and now,
  In the clear mirror of my truth, she may
  Behold his falsehood. O that I had wings
  To hear me to Palermo! This, once known,
  Must change her love into a just disdain,
  And work her to compassion of my pain.      [_Exit._



                          SCENE IV.

         _Palermo. A Room in_ CAMIOLA'_s House_.

_Enter_ SYLLI, CAMIOLA, _and_ CLARINDA, _at several doors._

  _Syl._ Undone! undone!--poor I, that whilome was
  The top and ridge of my house, am, on the sudden,
  Turn'd to the pitifullest animal
  O' the lineage of the Syllis!

  _Cam._ What's the matter?

  _Syl._ The king--break, girdle, break!

  _Cam._ Why, what of him?

  _Syl._ Hearing how far you doted on my person,
  Is come himself a suitor, with the awl
  Of his authority to bore my nose,
  And take you from me--Oh, oh, oh!

  _Cam._ Do not roar so:
  The king!

  _Syl._ The king. Yet loving Sylli is not
  So sorry for his own as your misfortune:
  If the king should carry you, he can but make you
  A queen, and what a simple thing is that
  To the being my lawful spouse! the world can never
  Afford you such a husband.

  _Cam._ I believe you.
  But how are you sure the king is so inclined?
  Did not you dream this?

  _Syl._ With these eyes I saw him
  Dismiss his train, and lighting from his coach,
  Whispering Fulgentio in the ear.

  _Cam._ If so,
  I guess the business.

  _Syl._ Yonder they are; I dare not

_Enter_ ROBERTO _and_ FULGENTIO.

  Be seen, I am so desperate: if you forsake me,
  Send me word, that I may provide a willow garland,
  To wear when I drown myself. O Sylli, Sylli!
                                  [_Exit crying._

  _Ful._ It will be worth your pains, sir, to observe
  The constancy and bravery of her spirit.
  Though great men tremble at your frowns, I dare
  Hazard my head your majesty, set off
  With terror, cannot fright her.

  _Rob._ May she answer
  My expectation!            [_Aside._

  _Ful._ There she is.

  _Cam._ My knees thus
  Bent to the earth, while my vows are sent upward
  For the safety of my sovereign, pay the duty
  Due for so great an honour, in this favour
  Done to your humblest handmaid.

  _Rob._ You mistake me;
  I come not, lady, that you may report
  The king, to do you honour, made your house
  (He being there) his court; but to correct
  Your stubborn disobedience. A pardon
  For that, could you obtain it, were well purchased
  With this humility.

  _Cam._ A pardon, sir!
  Till I am conscious of an offence,
  I will not wrong my innocence to beg one.
  What is my crime, sir?

  _Rob._ Look on him I favour,
  By you scorn'd and neglected.

  _Cam._ Is that all, sir?

  _Rob._ No, minion; though that were too much.
       How can you
  Answer the setting on your desperate bravo
  To murder him?

  _Cam._ With your leave, I must not kneel, sir,
  While I reply to this: but thus rise up
  In my defence, and tell you, as a man,
  (Since, when you are unjust, the deity,
  Which you may challenge as a king, parts from you,)
  'Twas never read in holy writ, or moral,
  That subjects on their loyalty were obliged
  To love their sovereign's vices: your grace, sir,
  To such an undeserver is no virtue.

  _Ful._ What think you now, sir?

  _Cam._ Say you should love wine,
  You being the king, and, 'cause I am your subject,
  Must I be ever drunk? Tyrants, not kings,
  By violence, from humble vassals force
  The liberty of their souls. I could not love him;
  And to compel affection, as I take it,
  Is not found in your prerogative.

  _Rob._ Excellent virgin!
  How I admire her confidence!      [_Aside._

  _Cam._ He complains
  Of wrong done him: but be no more a king,
  Unless you do me right. Burn your decrees,
  And of your laws and statutes make a fire
  To thaw the frozen numbness of delinquents,
  If he escape unpunish'd. Do your edicts
  Call it death in any man that breaks into
  Another's house to rob him, though of trifles;
  And shall Fulgentio, your Fulgentio, live,
  Who hath committed more than sacrilege,
  In the pollution of my clear fame
  By his malicious slanders?

  _Rob._ Have you done this?
  Answer truly, on your life.

  _Ful._ In the heat of blood,
  Some such thing I reported.

  _Rob._ Out of my sight!
  For I vow, if by true penitence thou win not
  This injured lady to sue out thy pardon,
  Thy grave is digg'd already.

  _Ful._ By my own folly
  I have made a fair hand of 't.      [_Aside, and Exit._

  _Rob._ You shall know, lady,
  While I wear a crown, Justice shall use her sword
  To cut offenders off, though nearest to us.

  _Cam._ Ay, now you show whose deputy you are:
  If now I bathe your feet with tears, it cannot
  Be censured superstition.

  _Rob._ You must rise;
  Rise in our favour and protection ever.
                                        [_Kisses her._

  _Cam._ Happy are subjects, when the prince is still
  Guided by justice, not his passionate will.
                                            [_Exeunt._


                      ACT V. SCENE I.

         _The same. A Room in_ CAMIOLA'_s House_.

_Enter_ CAMIOLA _and_ SYLLI.

  _Cam._ You see how tender I am of the quiet
  And peace of your affection, and what great ones
  I put off in your favour.

  _Syl._ You do wisely,
  Exceeding wisely; and, when I have said,
  I thank you for 't, be happy.

  _Cam._ And good reason,
  In having such a blessing.

  _Syl._ When you have it;
  But the bait is not yet ready.

_Enter_ CLARINDA _hastily_.

  _Cam._ What news with thee, now?

  _Clar._ Off with that gown, 'tis mine; mine by your promise:
  Signior Adorni is return'd! now upon entrance!
  Off with it, off with it, madam!

  _Cam._ Be not so hasty:
  When I go to bed, 'tis thine.

  _Syl._ You have my grant too;
  But, do you hear, lady, though I give way to this,
  You must hereafter ask my leave, before
  You part with things of moment.

  _Cam._ Very good;
  When I'm yours I'll be govern'd.

  _Syl._ Sweet obedience!

_Enter_ ADORNI.

  _Cam._ You are well return'd.

  _Ador._ I wish that the success
  Of my service had deserved it.

  _Cam._ Lives Bertoldo?

  _Ador._ Yes, and return'd with safety.

  _Cam._ 'Tis not then
  In the power of fate to add to, or take from
  My perfect happiness; and yet--he should
  Have made me his first visit.

  _Ador._ So I think too;
  But he----

  _Syl._ Durst not appear, I being present;
  That's his excuse, I warrant you.

  _Cam._ Speak, where is he?
  With whom? who hath deserved more from him? or
  Can be of equal merit? I in this
  Do not except the king.

  _Ador._ He's at the palace,
  With the duchess of Sienna. One coach brought them hither,
  Without a third: he's very gracious with her;
  You may conceive the rest.

  _Cam._ My jealous fears
  Make me to apprehend.

  _Ador._ Pray you, dismiss
  Signior Wisdom, and I'll make relation to you
  Of the particulars.

  _Cam._ Servant, I would have you
  To haste unto the court.

  _Syl._ I will outrun
  A footman for your pleasure.

  _Cam._ There observe
  The duchess' train, and entertainment.

  _Syl._ Fear not;
  I will discover all that is of weight,
  To the liveries of her pages and her footmen.
  This is fit employment for me.              [_Exit._

  _Cam._ Gracious with
  The duchess! sure you said so?

  _Ador._ I will use
  All possible brevity to inform you, madam,
  Of what was trusted to me, and discharged
  With faith and loyal duty.

  _Cam._ I believe it;
  You ransomed him, and supplied his wants--imagine
  That is already spoken; and what vows
  Of service he made to me, is apparent;
  His joy of me, and wonder too, perspicuous;
  Does not your story end so?

  _Ador._ Would the end
  Had answered the beginning!--In a word,
  Ingratitude and perjury at the height
  Cannot express him.

  _Cam._ Take heed.

  _Ador._ Truth is arm'd,
  And can defend itself. It must out, madam:
  I saw (the presence full) the amorous duchess
  Kiss and embrace him; on his part accepted
  With equal ardour; and their willing hands
  No sooner join'd, but a remove was publish'd,
  And put in execution.

  _Cam._ The proofs are
  Too pregnant. O Bertoldo!

  _Ador._ He's not worth
  Your sorrow, madam.

  _Cam._ Tell me, when you saw this,
  Did not you grieve, as I do now to hear it?

  _Ador._ His precipice from goodness raising mine,
  And serving as a foil to set my faith off,
  I had little reason.

  _Cam._ In this you confess
  The malice of your disposition. As
  You were a man, you stood bound to lament it;
  And not, in flattery of your false hopes,
  To glory in it. When good men pursue
  The path mark'd out by virtue, the blest saints
  With joy look on it, and seraphic angels
  Clap their celestial wings in heavenly plaudits,
  To see a scene of grace so well presented,
  The fiends, and men made up of envy, mourning.
  Whereas now, on the contrary, as far
  As their divinity can partake of passion,
  With me they weep, beholding a fair temple,
  Built in Bertoldo's loyalty, turn'd to ashes
  By the flames of his inconstancy, the damn'd
  Rejoicing in the object.--'Tis not well
  In you, Adorni.

  _Ador._ What a temper dwells
  In this rare virgin! [_Aside._] Can you pity him,
  That hath shown none to you?

  _Cam._ I must not be
  Cruel by his example. You, perhaps,
  Expect now I should seek recovery
  Of what I have lost, by tears, and with bent knees
  Beg his compassion. No; my towering virtue,
  From the assurance of my merit, scorns
  To stoop so low. I'll take a nobler course,
  And, confident in the justice of my cause,
  The king his brother, and new mistress, judges,
  Ravish him from her arms. You have the contract,
  In which he swore to marry me?

  _Ador._ 'Tis here, madam.

  _Cam._ He shall be, then, against his will, my husband;
  And when I have him, I'll so use him!--Doubt not,
  But that, your honesty being unquestion'd,
  This writing, with your testimony, clears all.

  _Ador._ And buries me in the dark mists of error.

  _Cam._ I'll presently to court; pray you, give order
  For my caroch[165]. [_Exit_ ADORNI.] My good angel help me,
  In these my extremities!

_Re-enter_ SYLLI.

  _Syl._ If you e'er will see brave sight,
  Lose it not now. Bertoldo and the duchess
  Are presently to be married: there's such pomp
  And preparation!

  _Cam._ If I marry, 'tis
  This day, or never.

  _Syl._ Why, with all my heart;
  Though I break this, I'll keep the next oath I make,
  And then it is quit.

  _Cam._ Follow me to my cabinet;
  You know my confessor, father Paulo?

  _Syl._ Yes: shall he
  Do the feat for us?

  _Cam._ I will give in writing
  Directions to him, and attire myself
  Like a virgin bride; and something I will do,
  That shall deserve men's praise and wonder too.
                                         [_Exeunt._


FOOTNOTE:

[165] _Caroch_,] i. e. _a large coach_. Coaches are said to have been
      first brought into England in 1564, by William Booner, a Dutchman,
      who became coachman to Queen Elizabeth.--NARES.


                          SCENE II.

           _The same. A State-room in the Palace._

_Loud music. Enter_ ROBERTO, BERTOLDO, AURELIA, FERDINAND, ASTUTIO,
GONZAGA, RODERIGO, JACOMO, PIERIO, _a Bishop, and Attendants_.

  _Rob._ Had our division been greater, madam,
  Your clemency, the wrong being done to you,
  In pardon of it, like the rod of concord,
  Must make a perfect union.--Once more,
  With a brotherly affection, we receive you
  Into our favour: let it be your study
  Hereafter to deserve this blessing, far
  Beyond your merit.

  _Bert._ As the princess' grace
  To me is without limit, my endeavours,
  With all obsequiousness to serve her pleasures,
  Shall know no bounds: nor will I, being made
  Her husband, e'er forget the duty that
  I owe her as a servant.

  _Aurel._ I expect not
  But fair equality, since I well know,
  If that superiority be due,
  'Tis not to me. When you are made my consort,
  All the prerogatives of my high birth cancell'd,
  I'll practise the obedience of a wife,
  And freely pay it.

  _Gonz._ This done, as it is promised, may well stand for
  A precedent to great women.

  _Rob._ One word more
  Touching the articles.

_Enter_ FULGENTIO, CAMIOLA, SYLLI, _and_ ADORNI.

  _Ful._ In you alone
  Lie all my hopes; you can or kill or save me;
  But pity in you will become you better
  (Though I confess injustice 'tis denied me)
  Than too much rigour.

  _Cam._ I will make your peace
  As far as it lies in me; but must first
  Labour to right myself.

  _Aurel._ Or add or alter
  What you think fit; in him I have my all:
  Heaven make me thankful for him!

  _Rob._ On to the temple.

  _Cam._ Stay, royal sir; and, as you are a king,
  Erect one[166] here, in doing justice to
  An injured maid.

  _Aurel._ How's this?

  _Bert._ O, I am blasted!

  _Rob._ I have given some proof, sweet lady, of my promptness
  To do you right; you need not, therefore, doubt me;
  And rest assured, that, this great work despatch'd,
  You shall have audience, and satisfaction
  To all you can demand.

  _Cam._ To do me justice
  Exacts your present care, and can admit
  Of no delay. If, ere my cause be heard,
  In favour of your brother you go on, sir,
  Your sceptre cannot right me. He's the man,
  The guilty man, whom I accuse; and you
  Stand bound in duty, as you are supreme,
  To be impartial. Since you are a judge,
  As a delinquent look on him, and not
  As on a brother: Justice painted blind,
  Infers her ministers are obliged to hear
  The cause, and truth, the judge, determine of it;
  And not sway'd or by favour or affection,
  By a false gloss, or wrested comment, alter
  The true intent and letter of the law.

  _Rob._ Nor will I, madam.

  _Aurel._ You seem troubled, sir.

  _Gonz._ His colour changes too.

  _Cam._ The alteration
  Grows from his guilt. The goodness of my cause
  Begets such confidence in me, that I bring
  No hired tongue to plead for me, that with gay
  Rhetorical flourishes may palliate
  That which, stripp'd naked, will appear deform'd.
  I stand here mine own advocate; and my truth,
  Deliver'd in the plainest language, will
  Make good itself; nor will I, if the king
  Give suffrage to it, but admit of you,
  My greatest enemy, and this stranger prince,
  To sit assistants with him.

  _Aurel._ I ne'er wrong'd you.

  _Cam._ In your knowledge of the injury, I believe it;
  Nor will you, in your justice, when you are
  Acquainted with my interest in this man,
  Which I lay claim to.

  _Rob._ Let us take our seats.
  What is your title to him?

  _Cam._ By this contract,
  Seal'd solemnly before a reverend man,
                      [_Presents a paper to the king._
  I challenge him for my husband.

  _Syl._ Ha! was I
  Sent for the friar for this?

  _Rob._ This writing is
  Authentical.

  _Aurel._ But, done in heat of blood,
  Charm'd by her flatteries, as, no doubt, he was,
  To be dispensed with.

  _Fer._ Add this, if you please,
  The distance and disparity between
  Their births and fortunes.

  _Cam._ What can Innocence hope for,
  When such as sit her judges are corrupted!
  Disparity of birth or fortune, urge you?
  Or syren charms? or, at his best, in me
  Wants to deserve him? Call some few days back,
  And, as he was, consider him, and you
  Must grant him my inferior. Imagine
  You saw him now in fetters, with his honour,
  His liberty lost; with her black wings Despair
  Circling his miseries, and this Gonzaga
  Trampling on his afflictions; the great sum
  Proposed for his redemption; the king
  Forbidding payment of it; his near kinsmen,
  With his protesting followers and friends,
  Falling off from him; by the whole world forsaken;
  Dead to all hope, and buried in the grave
  Of his calamities; and then weigh duly
  What she deserved, whose merits now are doubted,
  That, as his better angel, in her bounties
  Appear'd unto him, his great ransom paid,
  His wants, and with a prodigal hand, supplied;
  Whether, then, being my manumised slave,
  He owed not himself to me?

  _Aurel._ Is this true?

  _Rob._ In his silence 'tis acknowledged.

  _Gonz._ If you want
  A witness to this purpose, I'll depose it.

  _Cam._ If I have dwelt too long on my deservings
  To this unthankful man, pray you pardon me;
  The cause required it. And though now I add
  A little, in my painting to the life
  His barbarous ingratitude, to deter
  Others from imitation, let it meet with
  A fair interpretation. This serpent,
  Frozen to numbness, was no sooner warm'd
  In the bosom of my pity and compassion,
  But, in return, he ruin'd his preserver,
  The prints the irons had made in his flesh
  Still ulcerous; but all that I had done,
  My benefits, in sand or water written,
  As they had never been, no more remember'd!
  And on what ground, but his ambitious hopes
  To gain this duchess' favour?

  _Aurel._ Yes; the object,
  Look on it better, lady, may excuse
  The change of his affection.

  _Cam._ The object!
  In what? forgive me, modesty, if I say
  You look upon your form in the false glass
  Of flattery and self-love, and that deceives you.
  That you were a duchess, as I take it, was not
  Character'd on your face; and, that not seen,
  For other feature, make all these, that are
  Experienced in women, judges of them,
  And, if they are not parasites, they must grant,
  For beauty without art, though you storm at it,
  I may take the right-hand file.

  _Gonz._ Well said, i' faith!
  I see fair women on no terms will yield
  Priority in beauty.

  _Cam._ Down, proud heart!
  Why do I rise up in defence of that,
  Which, in my cherishing of it, hath undone me!
  No, madam, I recant,--you are all beauty,
  Goodness, and virtue; and poor I not worthy
  As a foil to set you off: enjoy your conquest;
  But do not tyrannize. Yet, as I am,
  In my lowness, from your height you may look on me,
  And, in your suffrage to me, make him know
  That, though to all men else I did appear
  The shame and scorn of women, he stands bound
  To hold me as the masterpiece.

  _Rob._ By my life,
  You have shown yourself of such an abject temper,
  So poor and low-condition'd, as I grieve for
  Your nearness to me.

  _Fer._ I am changed in my
  Opinion of you, lady; and profess
  The virtues of your mind an ample fortune
  For an absolute monarch.

  _Gonz._ Since you are resolved
  To damn yourself, in your forsaking of
  Your noble order for a woman, do it
  For this. You may search through the world, and meet not
  With such another phoenix.

  _Aurel._ On the sudden
  I feel all fires of love quench'd in the water
  Of my compassion.--Make your peace; you have
  My free consent; for here I do disclaim
  All interest in you: and, to further your
  Desires, fair maid, composed of worth and honour,
  The dispensation procured by me,
  Freeing Bertoldo from his vow, makes way
  To your embraces.

  _Bert._ Oh, how have I stray'd,
  And wilfully, out of the noble track
  Mark'd me by virtue! till now, I was never
  Truly a prisoner. To excuse my late
  Captivity, I might allege the malice
  Of Fortune; you, that conquer'd me, confessing
  Courage in my defence was no way wanting.
  But now I have surrender'd up my strengths
  Into the power of Vice, and on my forehead
  Branded, with mine own hand, in capital letters,
  DISLOYAL, and INGRATEFUL. Though barr'd from
  Human society, and hiss'd into
  Some desert ne'er yet haunted with the curses
  Of men and women, sitting as a judge
  Upon my guilty self, I must confess
  It justly falls upon me; and one tear,
  Shed in compassion of my sufferings, more
  Than I can hope for.

  _Cam._ This compunction
  For the wrong that you have done me, though you should
  Fix here, and your true sorrow move no further,
  Will, in respect I loved once, make these eyes
  Two springs of sorrow for you.

  _Bert._ In your pity
  My cruelty shows more monstrous: yet I am not,
  Though most ingrateful, grown to such a height
  Of impudence, as, in my wishes only,
  To ask your pardon. If, as now I fall
  Prostrate before your feet, you will vouchsafe
  To act your own revenge, treading upon me
  As a viper eating through the bowels of
  Your benefits, to whom, with liberty,
  I owe my being, 'twill take from the burden
  That now is insupportable.

  _Cam._ Pray you, rise;
  As I wish peace and quiet to my soul,
  I do forgive you heartily: yet, excuse me,
  Though I deny myself a blessing that,
  By the favour of the duchess, seconded
  With your submission, is offer'd to me;
  Let not the reason I allege for 't grieve you,
  You have been false once.--I have done: and if,
  When I am married, as this day I will be,
  As a perfect sign of your atonement with me,
  You wish me joy, I will receive it for
  Full satisfaction of all obligations
  In which you stand bound to me.

  _Bert._ I will do it,
  And, what's more, in despite of sorrow, live
  To see myself undone, beyond all hope
  To be made up again.

  _Syl._ My blood begins
  To come to my heart again.

  _Cam._ Pray you, signior Sylli,
  Call in the holy friar: he's prepared
  For finishing the work.

  _Syl._ I knew I was
  The man: heaven make me thankful!      [_Exit._

  _Rob._ Who is this?

  _Ast._ His father was the banker of Palermo,
  And this the heir of his great wealth: his wisdom
  Was not hereditary.

  _Aurel._ For my part,
  I cannot guess the issue.

_Re-enter_ SYLLI _with Father_ PAULO.

  _Syl._ Do your duty;
  And with all speed you can, you may despatch us.

  _Paul._ Thus, as a principal ornament to the church,
  I seize her.

  _All._ How!

  _Rob._ So young, and so religious!

  _Paul._ She has forsook the world.

  _Syl._ I shall run mad.

  _Rob._ Hence with the fool! [SYLLI _is thrust off_.] Proceed, sir.

  Paul. _Look on this_ MAID OF HONOUR, _now
  Truly honour'd in her vow
  She pays to heaven. This fair hair
  (Favours for great kings to wear)
  Must now be shorn; her rich array
  Changed into a homely gray:
  Instead of dainties, from the spring,
  For wine, cold water we will bring;
  And with fasting mortify
  The feasts of sensuality.
  Her jewels, beads; and she must look
  Not in a glass, but holy book,
  To teach her the ne'er-erring way
  To immortality. O may
  She, as she purposes to be
  A child new-born to piety,
  Perséver[167] in it, and good men,
  With saints and angels, say, Amen_!

  _Cam._ This is the marriage! this the port to which
  My vows must steer me! Fill my spreading sails
  With the pure wind of your devotions for me,
  That I may touch the secure haven, where
  Eternal happiness keeps her residence,
  Temptations to frailty never entering!
  I am dead to the world, and thus dispose
  Of what I leave behind me; and, dividing
  My state into three parts, I thus bequeath it:
  The first to the fair nunnery, to which
  I dedicate the last and better part
  Of my frail life; a second portion
  To pious uses; and the third to thee,
  Adorni, for thy true and faithful service.
  And, ere I take my last farewell, with hope
  To find a grant, my suit to you is, that
  You would, for my sake, pardon this young man,
  And to his merits love him, and no further.

  _Rob._ I thus confirm it.
                   [_Gives his hand to_ FULGENTIO.

  _Cam._ And, as e'er you hope,      [_To_ BERTOLDO.
  Like me, to be made happy, I conjure you
  To reassume your order; and in fighting
  Bravely against the enemies of our faith,
  Redeem your mortgaged honour.

  _Gonz._ I restore this:      [_Gives him the white cross._
  Once more, brothers in arms.

  _Bert._ I'll live and die so.

  _Cam._ To you my pious wishes! And, to end
  All differences, great sir, I beseech you
  To be an arbitrator, and compound
  The quarrel long continuing between
  The duke and duchess.

  _Rob._ I will take it into
  My special care.

  _Cam._ I am then at rest. Now, father,
  Conduct me where you please.
                    [_Exeunt_ PAULO _and_ CAMIOLA.

  _Rob._ She well deserves
  Her name, _the Maid of Honour_! May she stand,
  To all posterity, a fair example
  For noble maids to imitate! Since to live
  In wealth and pleasure's common, but to part with
  Such poison'd baits is rare; there being nothing
  Upon this stage of life to be commended,
  Though well begun, till it be fully ended.
                               [_Flourish. Exeunt._
