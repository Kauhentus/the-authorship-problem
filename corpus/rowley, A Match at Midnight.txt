Those actiues sparkling sweet discouered twins,
In their strong captiuating motion, told me
The story of your heart, a 10•0 Cupids

Carrying to the swiftnesse of conetous Fancie,
The very letters we spell loue with.

And with a Noble craft, he tempted mee
In mine owne house, and I bid him keep's disguise
But till this morning and he shoo'd perceive,
I loved him truely, intending here before ye,
To let him know't, especially i'th presence
Of you Sir, that intend me for your Wife.

Wid.
But true, as shee whose chast immaculate soule,
Retaines the Noble stampe of her integritie,
With an undefac't perfection—perchance as these
Nay Common Fame, hath scattered you, conceive me,
Because pale jealousie (Cupids angry Foole)
Was frequent lodger at that signe of Folly;
My husbands soone suspitious heart, that I
In a close clouded loosenesse, shoo'd expose him
To that desperate distraction of his fortunes,
That sent him to the Sea, to nourish her,
With your vaine hope, that the Fame of frequent suitors,

Was but a Maske of loose scapes, like men at Lotteries:
You thought to put in for one Sir, but beleeve me,
You have drawne a blanke.
Rand.
Beca• her looke ferry blacke indeed,
Wid.
Oh my beloved husband,
However in thy life, thy jealousie
Sent thee so farre to finde death, I will bee
I will be married to nothing but thy memory.
Alex.
But shall the pyes be spoyl'd then?

Let her alone, if her husband doe not know this.

Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.
Blood.
Her Husband I told you was a madman.

He is not dead Sir, hee had it spread a purpose, he is in England, and in your house, and looke: doe ye not see him?

Wid.
Where, where?
Iar.
Here, here hee is that hath found rash iealousie,
Loues ioyes, and a wife whose discreet carriage
Can intimate to all men a faire freedome.
And to one be faithfull, such a vvife I proue,
Her husbands glory worth a wealthy Loue.
Wid.
You are welcome to my soule Sir.
Blood.
By my troth Master Wag this was a waggs trick indeede, but I knew I know yee, I remembred you a mo∣neth agoe, but that I had forgotten where I saw you.

Sim.
I knew you were a crafty Merchant, you helpt my Master to such bargaines vpon the Exchange last night: here has beene the merriest morning after it.

Alex.
My Pitchers broke iust at the Well head, but giue me leaue to tell you Sir, that you haue a noble Wife, and indeed such a one as wood worthily feast the very dis∣cretion of a wise mans desire, her wit ingeniously waytes vpon her vertue, and her vertue aduisedly giues freedome to her wit, but because my marriage shall seriously pro∣ceede, I wed my selfe Sir to Obedience, and filiall regu∣larity, and vow to redeeme in the duty of a sonne, the affe∣ction of a father.

Iar.
Come my deseruing Wife,
Wisedome this day remarries vs. And Gentlemen
From all our errours wee'le extract this truth,
Where vitious ends prepose, they stand on wheeles,
And the least turne of chance throwes vp their heeles:
But vertues Louers euer greene doe last,
Like Lawrell which no lightening can blast.
FINIS.
