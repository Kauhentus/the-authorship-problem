Settings, Scene Breaks and Stage Directions.

     The original quarto does not provide settings for the play; all this edition's indicated settings are adopted from Gifford.
     The original quarto of The Picture was divided into five Acts and multiple scenes, which organization we follow.
     Finally, as is our normal practice, some stage directions have been added, and some modified, for purposes of clarity. Most of these minor changes are adopted from Gifford.


 

ACT I.

SCENE I.

The Frontiers of Bohemia.

Enter Mathias in armour, Sophia in a riding suit,

Corisca, Hilario, with other Servants.

1

Math.  Since we must part, Sophia, to pass further

2

Is not alone impertinent, but dangerous.

We are not distant from the Turkish camp

4

Above five leagues, and who knows but some party

Of his Timariots, that scour the country,

6

May fall upon us? − be now, as thy name,

Truly interpreted, hath ever spoke thee,

8

Wise and discreet; and to thy understanding

Marry thy constant patience.

10

Soph.                                 You put me, sir,

12

To the utmost trial of it.

14

Math.                           Nay, no melting;

Since the necessity that now separates us,

16

We have long since disputed, and the reasons,

Forcing me to it, too oft washed in tears.

18

I grant that you, in birth, were far above me,

And great men, my superiors, rivals for you;

20

But mutual consent of heart, as hands,

Joined by true love, hath made us one, and equal:

22

Nor is it in me mere desire of fame,

Or to be cried up by the public voice,

24

For a brave soldier, that puts on my armour:

Such airy tumours take not me. You know

26

How narrow our demeans are, and what's more,

Having as yet no charge of children on us,

28

We hardly can subsist.

30

Soph.                          In you alone, sir,

I have all abundance.

32

Math.                       For my mind's content,

34

In your own language I could answer you.

You have been an obedient wife, a right one;

36

And to my power, though short of your desert,

I have been ever an indulgent husband.

38

We have long enjoyed the sweets of love, and though

Not to satiety, or loathing, yet

40

We must not live such dotards on our pleasures,

As still to hug them, to the certain loss

42

Of profit and preferment. Competent means

Maintains a quiet bed; want breeds dissention,

44

Even in good women.

46

Soph.                        Have you found in me, sir,

Any distaste, or sign of discontent,

48

For want of what's superfluous?

50

Math.                                       No, Sophia;

Nor shalt thou ever have cause to repent

52

Thy constant course in goodness, if Heaven bless

My honest undertakings. 'Tis for thee

54

That I turn soldier, and put forth, dearest,

Upon this sea of action, as a factor,

56

To trade for rich materials to adorn

Thy noble parts, and shew them in full lustre.

58

I blush that other ladies, less in beauty

And outward form, but in the harmony

60

Of the soul's ravishing music, the same age

Not to be named with thee, should so out-shine thee

62

In jewèls, and variety of wardrobes;

While you, to whose sweet innocence both Indies

64

Compared are of no value, wanting these,

Pass unregarded.

66

Soph.                 If I am so rich, or

68

In your opiniön, why should you borrow

Additions for me?

70

Math.                Why! I should be censured

72

Of ignorance, possessing such a jewel

Above all price, if I forbear to give it

74

The best of ornaments: therefore, Sophia,

In few words know my pleasure, and obey me,

76

As you have ever done. To your discretion

I leave the government of my family,

78

And our poor fortunes; and from these command

Obedience to you, as to myself:

80

To the utmost of what's mine, live plentifully;

And, ere the remnant of our store be spent,

82

With my good sword I hope I shall reap for you

A harvest in such full abundance, as

84

Shall make a merry winter.

86

Soph.                                 Since you are not

To be diverted, sir, from what you purpose,

88

All arguments to stay you here are useless:

Go when you please, sir. − Eyes, I charge you waste not

90

One drop of sorrow; look you hoard all up

Till in my widowed bed I call upon you,

92

But then be sure you fail not. You blest angels,

Guardians of human life, I at this instant

94

Forbear t'invoke you: at our parting, 'twere

To personate devotiön. − My soul

96

Shall go along with you, and, when you are

Circled with death and horror, seek and find you:

98

And then I will not leave a saint unsued to

For your protectiön. To tell you what

100

I will do in your absence, would shew poorly;

My actions shall speak for me: 'twere to doubt you

102

To beg I may hear from you; where you are

You cannot live obscure, nor shall one post,

104

By night or day, pass unexamined by me.

If I dwell long upon your lips, consider,

106

[Kisses him.]

108

After this feast, the griping fast that follows,

110

And it will be excusable; pray turn from me.

All that I can, is spoken.

112

[Exit Sophia.]

114

Math.                           Follow your mistress.

116

Forbear your wishes for me; let me find them,

At my return, in your prompt will to serve her.

118

Hil.  For my part, sir, I will grow lean with study

120

To make her merry.

122

Coris.                    Though you are my lord,

Yet being her gentlewoman, by my place

124

I may take my leave; your hand, or, if you please

To have me fight so high, I'll not be coy,

126

But stand a-tip-toe for't.

128

Math.                           O, farewell, girl!

130

[Kisses her.]

132

Hil.  A kiss well begged, Corisca.

134

Coris.                                         'Twas my fee;

Love, how he melts! I cannot blame my lady's

136

Unwillingness to part with such marmalade lips.

There will be scrambling for them in the camp;

138

And were it not for my honesty, I could wish now

I were his leaguer laundress; I would find

140

Soap of mine own, enough to wash his linen,

Or I would strain hard for't.

142

Hil.                                  How the mammet twitters! −

144

Come, come; my lady stays for us.

146

Coris.                                           Would I had been

Her ladyship the last night!

148

Hil.                                    No more of that, wench.

150

[Exeunt Hilario, Corisca, and the rest.]

152

Math. I am strangely troubled: yet why I should nourish

154

A fury here, and with imagined food,

Having no real grounds on which to raise

156

A building of suspicion she was ever

Or can be false hereafter? I in this

158

But foolishly enquire the knowledge of

A future sorrow, which, if I find out,

160

My present ignorance were a cheap purchase,

Though with my loss of being. I have already

162

Dealt with a friend of mine, a general scholar,

One deeply read in nature's hidden secrets,

164

And, though with much unwillingness, have won him

To do as much as art can, to resolve me

166

My fate that follows. − To my wish, he's come.

168

Enter Baptista.

170

Julio Baptista, now I may affirm

Your promise and performance walk together;

172

And therefore, without circumstance, to the point:

Instruct me what I am.

174

Bapt.                           I could wish you had

176

Made trial of my love some other way.

178

Math.  Nay, this is from the purpose.

180

Bapt.                                                If you can

Proportion your desire to any mean,

182

I do pronounce you happy; I have found,

By certain rules of art, your matchless wife

184

Is to this present hour from all pollution

Free and untainted.

186

Math.                    Good.

188

Bapt.                             In reason, therefore,

190

You should fix here, and make no further search

Of what may fall hereafter.

192

Math.                                O, Baptista,

194

'Tis not in me to master so my passions;

I must know further, or you have made good

196

But half your promise. While my love stood by,

Holding her upright, and my presence was

198

A watch upon her, her desires being met too

With equal ardour from me, what one proof

200

Could she give of her constancy, being untempted?

But when I am absent, and my coming back

202

Uncertain, and those wanton heats in women

Not to be quenched by lawful means, and she

204

The absolute disposer of herself,

Without control or curb; nay, more, invited

206

By opportunity, and all strong temptations,

If then she hold out −

208

Bapt.                     As, no doubt, she will.

210

Math.  Those doubts must be made certainties, Baptista,

212

By your assurance; or your boasted art

Deserves no admiration. How you trifle,

214

And play with my affliction! I am on

The rack, till you confirm me.

216

Bapt.                                      Sure, Mathias,

218

I am no god, nor can I dive into

Her hidden thoughts, or know what her intents are;

220

That is denied to art, and kept concealed

Even from the devils themselves: they can but guess,

222

Out of long observation, what is likely;

But positively to fortell that shall be,

224

You may conclude impossible. All I can,

I will do for you; when you are distant from her

226

A thousand leagues, as if you then were with her,

You shall know truly when she is solicited,

228

And how far wrought on.

230

Math.                              I desire no more.

232

Bapt.  Take, then, this little model of Sophia,

With more than human skill limned to the life;

234

[Gives him a picture.]

236

Each line and lineament of it, in the drawing

238

So punctually observed, that, had it motion,

In so much 'twere herself.

240

Math.                               It is indeed

242

An admirable piece; but if it have not

Some hidden virtue that I cannot guess at,

244

In what can it advantage me?

246

Bapt.                                     I'll instruct you:

Carry it still about you, and as oft

248

As you desire to know how she's affected,

With curious eyes peruse it: while it keeps

250

The figure it now has, entire and perfit,

She is not only innocent in fact,

252

But unattempted; but if once it vary

From the true form, and what's now white and red

254

Incline to yellow, rest most confident

She's with all violence courted, but unconquered;

256

But if it turn all black, 'tis an assurance

The fort, by composition or surprise,

258

Is forced, or with her free consent surrendered.

260

Math.  How much you have engaged me for this favour,

The service of my whole life shall make good.

262

Bapt.  We will not part so, I'll along with you,

264

And it is needful: with the rising sun

The armies meet; yet, ere the fight begin,

266

In spite of opposition, I will place you

In the head of the Hungarian general's troop,

268

And near his person.

270

Math.                      As my better angel,

You shall direct and guide me.

272

Bapt.                                      As we ride

274

I'll tell you more.

276

Math.                 In all things I'll obey you.

278

[Exeunt.]

ACT I, SCENE II.

Alba Regalis, Hungary.

A State-room in the Palace.

Enter Ubaldo and Ricardo.

1

Ric.  When came the post?

2

Ubald.                           The last night.

4

Ric.                                                   From the camp?

6

Ubald.  Yes, as 'tis said, and the letter writ and signed

8

By the general, Ferdinand.

10

Ric.                                  Nay, then, sans question,

It is of moment.

12

Ubald.             It concerns the lives

14

Of two great armies.

16

Ric.                        Was it cheerfully

Received by the king?

18

Ubald.                      Yes; for being assured

20

The armies were in view of one another,

Having proclaimed a public fast and prayer

22

For the good success, he dispatched a gentleman

Of his privy chamber to the general,

24

With absolute authority from him

To try the fortune of a day.

26

Ric.                                    No doubt then

28

The general will come on, and fight it bravely.

Heaven prosper him! This military art

30

I grant to be the noblest of professions;

And yet, I thank my stars for't, I was never

32

Inclined to learn it; since this bubble honour

(Which is, indeed, the nothing soldiers fight for),

34

With the loss of limbs or life, is, in my judgment,

Too dear a purchase.

36

Ubald.                     Give me our court-warfare:

38

The danger is not great in the encounter

Of a fair mistress.

40

Ric.                     Fair and sound together

42

Do very well, Ubaldo; but such are,

With difficulty to be found out; and when they know

44

Their value, prized too high. By thy own report,

Thou wast at twelve a gamester, and since that,

46

Studied all kinds of females, from the night-trader

I' the street, with certain danger to thy pocket,

48

To the great lady in her cabinet;

That spent upon thee more in cullises,

50

To strengthen thy weak back, than would maintain

Twelve Flanders mares, and as many running horses:

52

Besides apothecaries and chirurgeons' bills,

Paid upon all occasions, and those frequent.

54

Ubald.  You talk, Ricardo, as if yet you were

56

A novice in those mysteries.

58

Ric.                                      By no means;

My doctor can assure the contrary:

60

I lose no time. I have felt the pain and pleasure,

As he that is a gamester, and plays often,

62

Must sometimes be a loser.

64

Ubald.                             Wherefore, then,

Do you envy me?

66

Ric.                    It grows not from my want,

68

Nor thy abundance; but being, as I am,

The likelier man, and of much more experience,

70

My good parts are my curses: there's no beauty,

But yields ere it be summoned; and, as nature

72

Had signed me the monopoly of maidenheads,

There's none can buy till I have made my market.

74

Satiety cloys me; as I live, I would part with

Half my estate, nay, travel o'er the world,

76

To find that only phoenix in my search,

That could hold out against me.

78

Ubald.                                      Be not rapt so;

80

You may spare that labour. As she is a woman,

What think you of the queen?

82

Ric.                                      I dare not aim at

84

The petticoat royal, that is still excepted:

Yet, were she not my king's, being the abstract

86

Of all that's rare, or to be wished in woman,

To write her in my catalogue, having enjoyed her,

88

I would venture my neck to a halter − but we talk of

Impossibilities: as she hath a beauty

90

Would make old Nestor young; such majesty

Draws forth a sword of terror to defend it,

92

As would fright Paris, though the queen of love

Vowed her best furtherance to him.

94

Ubald.                                          Have you observed

96

The gravity of her language, mixed with sweetness?

98

Ric.  Then at what distance she reserves herself

When the king himself makes his approaches to her.

100

Ubald.  As she were still a virgin, and his life

102

But one continued wooing.

104

Ric.                                   She well knows

Her worth, and values it.

106

Ubald.                           And so far the king is

108

Indulgent to her humours, that he forbears

The duty of a husband, but when she calls for't.

110

Ric.  All his imaginatiöns and thoughts

112

Are buried in her; the loud noise of war

Cannot awake him.

114

Ubald.                  At this very instant,

116

When both his life and crown are at the stake,

He only studies her content, and when

118

She's pleased to shew herself, music and masques

Are with all care and cost provided for her.

120

Ric.  This night she promised to appear.

122

Ubald.                                                  You may

124

Believe it by the diligence of the king,

As if he were her harbinger.

126

[Enter Ladislaus, Eubulus,

128

and Attendants with perfumes.]

130

Ladis.                                 These rooms

Are not perfumed, as we directed.

132

Eubu.                                         Not, sir!

134

I know not what you would have; I am sure the smoke

Cost treble the price of the whole week's provision

136

Spent in your majesty's kitchens.

138

Ladis.                                         How I scorn

Thy gross comparison! When my Honoria,

140

The amazement of the present time, and envy

Of all succeeding ages, does descend

142

To sanctify a place, and in her presence

Makes it a temple to me, can I be

144

Too curious, much less prodigal, to receive her?

But that the splendour of her beams of beauty

146

Hath struck thee blind −

148

Eubu.                         As dotage hath done you.

150

Ladis.  Dotage? O blasphemy! is it in me

To serve her to her merit? Is she not

152

The daughter of a king?

154

Eubu.                          And you the son

Of ours, I take it; by what privilege else

156

Do you reign over us? for my part, I know not

Where the disparity lies.

158

Ladis.                           Her birth, old man,

160

(Old in the kingdom's service, which protects thee),

Is the least grace in her: and though her beauties

162

Might make the Thunderer a rival for her,

They are but superficial ornaments,

164

And faintly speak her: from her heavenly mind,

Were all antiquity and fiction lost,

166

Our modern poets could not, in their fancy,

But fashion a Minerva far transcending

168

The imagined one whom Homer only dreamt of.

But then add this, she's mine, mine, Eubulus!

170

And though she knows one glance from her fair eyes

Must make all gazers her idolaters,

172

She is so sparing of their influence,

That, to shun superstitiön in others,

174

She shoots her powerful beams only at me.

And can I, then, whom she desires to hold

176

Her kingly captive above all the world,

Whose natiöns and empires, if she pleased,

178

She might command as slaves, but gladly pay

The humble tribute of my love and service,

180

Nay, if I said of adoration, to her,

I did not err?

182

Eubu.       Well, since you hug your fetters,

184

In Love's name wear them! You are a king, and that

Concludes you wise, your will, a powerful reason:

186

Which we, that are foolish subjects, must not argue.

And what in a mean man I should call folly,

188

Is in your majesty remarkable wisdom:

But for me, I subscribe.

190

Ladis.                          Do, and look up,

192

Upon this wonder.

194

Loud music.

Enter Honoria in state under a Canopy;

196

her train borne up by Sylvia and Acanthe.

198

Ric.                    Wonder! It is more, sir.

200

Ubald.  A rapture, an astonishment.

202

Ric.                                              What think you, sir?

204

Eubu.  As the king thinks; that is the surest guard

We courtiers ever lie at. Was prince ever

206

So drowned in dotage? Without spectacles

I can see a handsome woman, and she is so:

208

But yet to admiration look not on her.

Heaven, how he fawns! and, as it were his duty,

210

With what assurèd gravity she receives it!

Her hand again! O she at length vouchsafes

212

Her lip, and as he had sucked nectar from it,

How he's exalted! Women in their natures

214

Affect command; but this humility

In a husband and a king marks her the way

216

To absolute tyranny.

218

[The king seats her on his throne.]

220

                              So! Juno's placed

In Jove's tribunal: and, like Mercury,

222

(Forgetting his own greatness), he attends

For her employments. She prepares to speak;

224

What oracles shall we hear now?

226

Hon.                                        That you please, sir,

With such assurances of love and favour,

228

To grace your handmaid, but in being yours, sir,

A matchless queen, and one that knows herself so,

230

Binds me in retribution to deserve

The grace conferred upon me.

232

Ladis.                                    You transcend

234

In all things excellent: and it is my glory,

Your worth weighed truly, to depose myself

236

From absolute command, surrendering up

My will and faculties to your disposure:

238

And here I vow, not for a day or year,

But my whole life, which I wish long to serve you,

240

That whatsoever I in justice may

Exact from these my subjects, you from me

242

May boldly challenge: and when you require it,

In sign of my subjection, as your vassal,

244

Thus I will pay my homage.

246

Hon.                                   O forbear, sir!

Let not my lips envy my robe; on them

248

Print your allegiance often: I desire

No other fealty.

250

Ladis.             Gracious sovereign!

252

Boundless in bounty!

254

Eubu.                       Is not here fine fooling!

He's, questionless, bewitched. Would I were gelt,

256

So that would disenchant him! though I forfeit

My life for't, I must speak. − By your good leave, sir –

258

I have no suit to you, nor can you grant one,

Having no power: you are like me, a subject,

260

Her more than serene majesty being present.

And I must tell you, 'tis ill manners in you,

262

Having deposed yourself, to keep your hat on,

And not stand bare, as we do, being no king,

264

But a fellow-subject with us. − Gentlemen ushers,

It does belong to your place, see it reformed;

266

He has given away his crown, and cannot challenge

The privilege of his bonnet.

268

Ladis.                                 Do not tempt me.

270

Eubu. Tempt you! in what? in following your example?

272

If you are angry, question me hereafter,

As Ladislaus should do Eubulus,

274

On equal terms. You were of late my sovereign,

But weary of it, I now bend my knee

276

To her divinity, and desire a boon

From her more than magnificence.

278

Hon.                                             Take it freely. −

280

Nay, be not moved; for our mirth's sake let us hear him.

282

Eubu.  'Tis but to ask a question: Have you ne'er read

The story of Semiramis and Ninus?

284

Hon.  Not as I remember.

286

Eubu.                            I will then instruct you,

288

And 'tis to the purpose: this Ninus was a king,

And such an impotent loving king as this was,

290

But now he's none; this Ninus (pray you observe me)

Doted on this Semiramis, a smith's wife

292

(I must confess, there the comparison holds not,

You are a king's daughter, yet, under your correction,

294

Like her, a woman); this Assyrian monarch,

Of whom this is a pattern, to express

296

His love and service, seated her, as you are,

In his regal throne, and bound by oath his nobles,

298

Forgetting all allegiance to himself,

One day to be her subjects, and to put

300

In executiön whatever she

Pleased to impose upon them: − pray you command him

302

To minister the like to us, and then

You shall hear what followed.

304

Ladis.                                    Well, sir, to your story.

306

Eubu.  You have no warrant, stand by; let me know

308

Your pleasure, goddess.

310

Hon.                             Let this nod assure you.

312

Eubu.  Goddess-like, indeed! as I live, a pretty idol!

She knowing her power, wisely made use of it;

314

And fearing his inconstancy, and repentance

Of what he had granted (as, in reason, madam,

316

You may do his), that he might never have

Power to recall his grant, or question her

318

For her short government, instantly gave order

To have his head struck off.

320

Ladis.                                  Is't possible?

322

Eubu.  The story says so, and commends her wisdom

324

For making use of her authority.

And it is worth your imitation, madam:

326

He loves subjection, and you are no queen,

Unless you make him feel the weight of it.

328

You are more than all the world to him, and that

He may be so to you, and not seek change

330

When his delights are sated, mew him up

In some close prison (if you let him live,

332

Which is no policy), and there diet him

As you think fit, to feed your appetite;

334

Since there ends his ambition.

336

Ubald.                                   Devilish counsel!

338

Ric.  The king's amazed.

340

Ubald.                         The queen appears, too, full

Of deep imaginations; Eubulus

342

Hath put both to it.

344

Ric.                      Now she seems resolved:

I long to know the issue.

346

[Honoria descends from the throne.]

348

Hon.                             Give me leave,

350

Dear sir, to reprehend you for appearing

Perplexed with what this old man, out of envy

352

Of your unequal graces, showered upon me,

Hath, in his fabulous story, saucily

354

Applied to me. Sir, that you only nourish

One doubt Honoria dares abuse the power

356

With which she is invested by your favour;

Or that she ever can make use of it

358

To the injury of you, the great bestower,

Takes from your judgment. It was your delight

360

To seek to me with more obsequiousness

Than I desired: and stood it with my duty

362

Not to receive what you were pleased to offer?

I do but act the part you put upon me,

364

And though you make me personate a queen,

And you my subject, when the play, your pleasure,

366

Is at a period, I am what I was

Before I entered, still your humble wife,

368

And you my royal sovereign.

370

Ric.                                      Admirable!

372

Hon.  I have heard of captains taken more with dangers

Than the rewards; and if, in your approaches

374

To those delights which are your own, and freely,

To heighten your desire, you make the passage

376

Narrow and difficult, shall I prescribe you,

Or blame your fondness? or can that swell me

378

Beyond my just proportion?

380

Ubald.                              Above wonder!

382

Ladis.  Heaven make me thankful for such goodness.

384

Hon.                                                             Now, sir,

The state I took to satisfy your pleasure,

386

I change to this humility; and the oath

You made to me of homage, I thus cancel,

388

And seat you in your own.

390

[Leads the king to the throne.]

392

Ladis.                               I am transported

Beyond myself.

394

Hon.               And now, to your wise lordship:

396

Am I proved a Semiramis? or hath

My Ninus, as maliciously you made him,

398

Cause to repent the excess of favour to me,

Which you call dotage?

400

Ladis.                         Answer, wretch!

402

Eubu.                                                  I dare, sir,

404

And say, however the event may plead

In your defence, you had a guilty cause;

406

Nor was it wisdom in you, I repeat it,

To teach a lady, humble in herself,

408

With the ridiculous dotage of a lover,

To be ambitious.

410

Hon.                  Eubulus, I am so;

412

Tis rooted in me; you mistake my temper.

I do profess myself to be the most

414

Ambitious of my sex, but not to hold

Command over my lord; such a proud torrent

416

Would sink me in my wishes: not that I

Am ignorant how much I can deserve,

418

And may with justice challenge.

420

Eubu.  [Aside]                          This I looked for;

After this seeming humble ebb, I knew

422

A gushing tide would follow.

424

Hon.                                     By my birth,

And liberal gifts of nature, as of fortune,

426

From you, as things beneath me, I expect

What's due to majesty, in which I am

428

A sharer with your sovereign.

430

Eubu.                                    Good again!

432

Hon.  And as I am most eminent in place,

In all my actiöns I would appear so.

434

Ladis.  You need not fear a rival.

436

Hon.                                           I hope not;

438

And till I find one, I disdain to know

What envy is.

440

Ladis.          You are above it, madam.

442

Hon.  For beauty without art, discourse, and free

444

From affectation, with what graces else

Can in the wife and daughter of a king

446

Be wished, I dare prefer myself, as −

448

Eubu.                                              I

Blush for you, lady. Trumpet your own praises!

450

This spoken by the people had been heard

With honour to you. Does the court afford

452

No oil-tongued parasite, that you are forced

To be your own gross flatterer?

454

Ladis.                                      Be dumb,

456

Thou spirit of contradictiön!

458

Hon.                                   The wolf

But barks against the moon, and I contemn it.

460

[A horn sounded within.]

462

The masque you promised?

464

Ladis.                                 Let them enter.

466

Enter a Post.

468

                                                                  How!

470

Eubu.  Here's one, I fear, unlooked for.

472

Ladis.                                                From the camp?

474

Post.   The general, victorious in your fortune,

476

Kisses your hand in this, sir.

478

[Delivers a letter.]

480

Ladis.                                 That great Power,

Who at his pleasure does dispose of battailes,

482

Be ever praised for't! Read, sweet, and partake it:

The Turk is vanquished, and with little loss

484

Upon our part, in which our joy is doubled.

486

Eubu. But let it not exalt you; bear it, sir,

With moderation, and pay what you owe for't.

488

Ladis. I understand thee, Eubulus. − I'll not now

490

Enquire particulars. −

492

[Exit Post.]

494

                                − Our delights deferred,

With reverence to the temples; there we'll tender

496

Our souls' devotiöns to His dread might,

Who edged our swords, and taught us how to fight.

498

[Exeunt.]

ACT II.

SCENE I.

Bohemia.

A Room in Mathias' House.

Enter Hilario and Corisca.

1

Hil.  You like my speech?

2

Coris.                             Yes, if you give it action

4

In the delivery.

6

Hil.                 If! I pity you.

I have played the fool before; this is not the first time,

8

Nor shall be, I hope, the last.

10

Coris.                                  Nay, I think so too.

12

Hil.  And if I put her not out of her dumps with laughter,

I'll make her howl for anger.

14

Coris.                                  Not too much

16

Of that, good fellow Hilario: our sad lady

Hath drank too often of that bitter cup;

18

A pleasant one must restore her. With what patience

Would she endure to hear of the death of my lord;

20

That, merely out of doubt he may miscarry,

Afflicts herself thus?

22

Hil.                        Umph! 'tis a question

24

A widow only can resolve. There be some

That in their husbands’ sicknesses have wept

26

Their pottle of tears a day; but being once certain

At midnight he was dead, have in the morning

28

Dried up their handkerchiefs, and thought no more on't.

30

Coris.  Tush, she is none of that race; if her sorrow

Be not true and perfit, I, against my sex,

32

Will take my oath woman ne'er wept in earnest.

She has made herself a prisoner to her chamber,

34

Dark as a dungeon, in which no beam

Of comfort enters. She admits no visits;

36

Eats little, and her nightly music is

Of sighs and groans, tuned to such harmony

38

Of feeling grief, that I, against my nature,

Am made one of the consort. This hour only

40

She takes the air, a custom every day

She solemnly observes, with greedy hopes,

42

From some that pass by, to receive assurance

Of the success and safety of her lord.

44

Now, if that your device will take −

46

Hil.                                              Ne'er fear it:

I am provided cap-à-pe, and have

48

My properties in readiness.

50

Soph.  [within]                 Bring my veil, there.

52

Coris.  Be gone, I hear her coming.

54

Hil.                                                If I do not

Appear, and, what's more, appear perfit, hiss me.

56

[Exit Hilario.]

58

Enter Sophia.

60

Soph.  I was flattered once, I was a star, but now 

62

Turned a prodigious meteor, and, like one,

Hang in the air between my hopes and fears;

64

And every hour, the little stuff burnt out

That yields a waning light to dying comfort,

66

I do expect my fall, and certain ruin.

In wretched things more wretched is delay;

68

And Hope, a parasite to me, being unmasked,

Appears more horrid than Despair, and my

70

Distraction worse than madness. Even my prayers,

When with most zeal sent upward, are pulled down

72

With strong imaginary doubts and fears,

And in their sudden precipice o'erwhelm me.

74

Dreams and fantastic visions walk the round

About my widowed bed, and every slumber's

76

Broken with loud alarms: can these be then

But sad presages, girl?

78

Coris.                       You make them so,

80

And antedate a loss shall ne'er fall on you.

Such pure affectiön, such mutual love,

82

A bed, and undefiled on either part,

A house without contention, in two bodies

84

One will and soul, like to the rod of concord,

Kissing each other, cannot be short-lived,

86

Or end in barrenness. − If all these, dear madam,

(Sweet in your sadness,) should produce no fruit,

88

Or leave the age no models of yourselves,

To witness to posterity what you were;

90

Succeeding times, frighted with the example,

But hearing of your story, would instruct

92

Their fairest issue to meet sensually,

Like other creatures, and forbear to raise

94

True Love, or Hymen, altars.

96

Soph.                                    O Corisca,

I know thy reasons are like to thy wishes;

98

And they are built upon a weak foundation,

To raise me comfort. Ten long days are past,

100

Ten long days, my Corisca, since my lord

Embarked himself upon a sea of danger,

102

In his dear care of me. And if his life

Had not been shipwracked on the rock of war,

104

His tenderness of me (knowing how much

I languish for his absence) had provided

106

Some trusty friend, from whom I might receive

Assurance of his safety.

108

Coris.                           Ill news, madam,

110

Are swallow-winged, but what's good walks on crutches:

With patiënce expect it, and, ere long,

112

No doubt you shall hear from him.

114

[A sowgelder's horn without.]

116

Soph.                                             Ha! What's that?

118

Coris.  [Aside]

The fool has got a sowgelder's horn. − A post,

120

As I take it, madam.

122

Soph.                     It makes this way still;

Nearer and nearer.

124

Coris.                    From the camp, I hope.

126

Enter a Post, with a horn;

128

followed by Hilario, in antic armour,

with long white hair and beard.

130

Soph.  The messenger appears, and in strange armour,

132

Heaven! if it be thy will −

134

Hil.                                It is no boot

To strive; our horses tired, let's walk on foot:

136

And that the castle, which is very near us,

To give us entertainment, may soon hear us,

138

Blow lustily, my lad, and drawing nigh-a,

Ask for a lady which is cleped Sophia.

140

Coris.  He names you, madam.

142

Hil.                                        For to her I bring,

144

Thus clad in arms, news of a pretty thing,

By name Mathias.

146

[Exit Post.]

148

Soph.                  From my lord? O sir,

150

I am Sophia, that Mathias' wife.

So may Mars favour you in all your battailes,

152

As you with speed unload me of the burthen

I labour under, till I am confirmed

154

Both where and how you left him!

156

Hil.                                               If thou art,

As I believe, the pigsney of his heart,

158

Know he's in health, and what's more, full of glee;

And so much I was willed to say to thee.

160

Soph.  Have you no letters from him?

162

Hil.                                                 No more words.

164

In the camp we use no pens, but write with swords;

Yet, as I am enjoined, by word of mouth

166

I will proclaim his deeds from north to south;

But tremble not, while I relate the wonder,

168

Though my eyes like lightning shine, and my voice thunder.

170

Soph.  This is some counterfeit braggart.

172

Coris.                                              Hear him, madam.

174

Hil.  The rear marched first, which followed by the van,

And winged with the battalia, no man

176

Durst stay to shift a shirt, or louse himself;

Yet, ere the armies joined, that hopeful elf,

178

Thy dear, thy dainty duckling, bold Mathias,

Advanced, and stared like Hercules or Golias.

180

A hundred thousand Turks, it is no vaunt,

Assailed him; every one a Termagaunt:

182

But what did he, then! with his keen-edge spear

He cut and carbonated them: here and there

184

Lay legs and arms; and, as 'tis said truly

Of Bevis, some he quartered all in three.

186

Soph.  This is ridiculous. 

188

Hil.                               I must take breath;

190

Then, like a nightingale, I'll sing his death.

192

Soph.  His death!

194

Hil.  [Aside to Corisca] I am out.

196

Coris.                                     Recover, dunder-head.

198

Hil.  How he escaped, I should have sung, not died;

For, though a knight, when I said so, I lied.

200

Weary he was, and scarce could stand upright,

And looking round for some courageous knight

202

To rescue him, as one perplexed in woe,

He called to me, “Help, help, Hilario!

204

My valiant servant, help!”

206

Coris.                            He has spoiled all.

208

Soph.  Are you the man of arms, then? I'll make bold

To take off your martial beard, you had fool's hair

210

Enough without it. Slave! how durst thou make

Thy sport of what concerns me more than life,

212

In such an antic fashion? Am I grown

Contemptible to those I feed? − you, minion,

214

Had a hand in it too, as it appears;

Your petticoat serves for bases to this warrior.

216

Coris.  We did it for your mirth.

218

Hil.                                           For myself, I hope,

220

I have spoke like a soldier.

222

Soph.                               Hence, you rascal!

I never but with reverence name my lord,

224

And can I hear it by thy tongue profaned,

And not correct thy folly? but you are

226

Transformed and turned knight-errant; take your course,

And wander where you please; for here I vow

228

By my lord's life, (an oath I will not break,)

Till his return, or certainty of his safety,

230

My doors are shut against thee.

232

[Exit Sophia.]

234

Coris.                                     You have made

A fine piece of work on't! How do you like the quality?

236

You had a foolish itch to be an actor,

And may stroll where you please.

238

Hil.                                         Will you buy my share?

240

Coris.  No, certainly; I fear I have already

242

Too much of mine own: I'll only, as a damsel,

(As the books say,) thus far help to disarm you;

244

And so, dear Don Quixote, taking my leave,

I leave you to your fortune.

246

 [Exit Corisca.]

248

Hil.                                   Have I sweat

250

My brains out for this quaint and rare invention,

And am I thus rewarded? I could turn

252

Tragedian and roar now, but that I fear

'Twould get me too great a stomach, having no meat

254

To pacify colon: what will become of me?

I cannot beg in armour, and steal I dare not:

256

My end must be to stand in a corn field,

And fright away the crows, for bread and cheese;

258

Or find some hollow tree in the highway,

And there, until my lord return, sell switches:

260

No more Hilario, but Dolorio now,

I'll weep my eyes out, and be blind of purpose

262

To move compassiön; and so I vanish.

264

[Exit Hilario.]

ACT II, SCENE II.

Alba Regalis, Hungary.

An Ante-room in the Palace.

Enter Eubulus, Ubaldo, Ricardo, and others.

1

Eubu.  Are the gentlemen sent before, as it was ordered

2

By the king's directiön, to entertain

The general?

4

Ric.            Long since; they by this have met him,

6

And given him the bienvenu.

8

Eubu.                                    I hope I need not

Instruct you in your parts.

10

Ubald.                            How! us, my lord!

12

Fear not; we know our distances and degrees

To the very inch where we are to salute him.

14

Ric.  The state were miserable, if the court had none

16

Of her own breed, familiar with all garbs

Gracious in England, Italy, Spain, or France;

18

With form and punctuality to receive

Stranger ambassadors: for the general,

20

He's a mere native, and it matters not

Which way we do accost him.

22

Ubald.                                  Tis great pity

24

That such as sit at the helm provide no better

For the training up of the gentry. In my judgment

26

An academy erected, with large pensions

To such as in a table could set down

28

The congees, cringes, postures, methods, phrase,

Proper to every nation −

30

Ric.                            O, it were

32

An admirable piece of work!

34

Ubald.                                 And yet rich fools

Throw away their charity on hospitals

36

For beggars and lame soldiers, and ne'er study

The due regard to compliment and courtship,

38

Matters of more import, and are indeed

The glories of a monarchy.

40

Eubu.                                These, no doubt,

42

Are state points, gallants, I confess; but, sure,

Our court needs no aids this way, since it is

44

A school of nothing else. There are some of you

Whom I forbear to name, whose coining heads

46

Are the mints of all new fashions, that have done

More hurt to the kingdom by superfluous bravery,

48

Which the foolish gentry imitate, than a war,

Or a long famine; all the treasure, by

50

This foul excess, is got into the merchant,

Embroiderer, silkman, jeweller, tailor's hand,

52

And the third part of the land too, the nobility

Engrossing titles only.

54

Ric.                           My lord, you are bitter.

56

[A trumpet.]

58

Enter a Servant.

60

Serv.  The general is alighted, and now entered.

62

Ric.  Were he ten generals, I am prepared,

64

And know what I will do.

66

Eubu.                             Pray you, what, Ricardo?

68

Ric.  I'll fight at compliment with him.

70

Ubald.                                         I'll charge home too.

72

Eubu.  And that's a desperate service; if you come off well.

74

Enter Ferdinand, Mathias, Baptista, and two Captains.

76

Ferd.  Captain, command the officers to keep

The soldier, as he marched, in rank and file,

78

Till they hear further from me.

80

[Exeunt Captains.]

82

Eubu.                                      Here's one speaks

In another key; this is no canting language

84

Taught in your academy.

86

Ferd.                             Nay, I will present you

To the king myself.

88

Math.                   A grace beyond my merit.

90

Ferd.  You undervalue what I cannot set

92

Too high a price on.

94

Eubu.                    With a friend's true heart,

I gratulate your return.

96

Ferd.                         Next to the favour

98

Of the great king, I am happy in your friendship.

100

Ubald.  By courtship, coarse on both sides!

102

Ferd.                                              Pray you, receive

This stranger to your knowledge; on my credit,

104

At all parts he deserves it.

106

Eubu.                              Your report

Is a strong assurance to me. Sir, most welcome.

108

Math.  This said by you, the reverence of your age

110

Commands me to believe it.

112

Ric.                                    This was pretty;

But second me now. − I cannot stoop too low

114

To do your excellence that due observance

Your fortune claims.

116

Eubu.                       He ne'er thinks on his virtue!

118

Ric.  For being, as you are, the soul of soldiers,

120

And bulwark of Bellona −

122

Ubald.                          The protection

Both of the court and king −

124

Ric.                                 And the sole minion

126

Of mighty Mars −

128

Ubald.                One that with justice may

Increase the number of the worthies −

130

Eubu.                                               Hoyday!

132

Ric.  It being impossible in my arms to circle

134

Such giant worth −

136

Ubald.              At distance we presume

To kiss your honoured gauntlet.

138

Eubu.                                      What reply now

140

Can he make to this foppery?

142

Ferd.                                   You have said,

Gallants, so much, and hitherto done so little,

144

That, till I learn to speak, and you to do,

I must take time to thank you.

146

Eubu.                                    As I live,

148

Answered as I could wish. How the fops gape now!

150

Ric.  This was harsh and scurvy.

152

Ubald.                                    We will be revenged

When he comes to court the ladies, and laugh at him.

154

Eubu.  Nay, do your offices, gentlemen, and conduct

156

The general to the presence.

158

Ric.                                     Keep your order.

160

Ubald.  Make way for the general.

162

[Exeunt all but Eubulus.]

164

Eubu.                                        What wise man,

That, with judicious eyes, looks on a soldier,

166

But must confess that fortune's swinge is more

O'er that profession, than all kinds else

168

Of life pursued by man? They, in a state,

Are but as chirurgeöns to wounded men,

170

E'en desperate in their hopes: while pain and anguish

Make them blaspheme, and call in vain for death:

172

Their wives and children kiss the chirurgeon's knees,

Promise him mountains, if his saving hand

174

Restore the tortured wretch to former strength.

But when grim death, by Æsculapius' art,

176

Is frighted from the house, and health appears

In sanguine colours on the sick man's face,

178

All is forgot; and, asking his reward,

He's paid with curses, often receives wounds

180

From him whose wounds he cured: so soldiers,

Though of more worth and use, meet the same fate,

182

As it is too apparent. I have observed,

When horrid Mars, the touch of whose rough hand

184

With palsies shakes a kingdom, hath put on

His dreadful helmet, and with terror fills

186

The place where he, like an unwelcome guest,

Resolves to revel, how the lords of her, like

188

The tradesman, merchant, and litigious pleader,

And such-like scarabs, bred in the dung of peace,

190

In hope of their protection, humbly offer

Their daughters to their beds, heirs to their service,

192

And wash with tears their sweat, their dust, their scars:

But when those clouds of war, that menaced

194

A bloody deluge to the affrighted state,

Are, by their breath, dispersed, and over-blown,

196

And famine, blood, and death, Bellona's pages,

Whipt from the quiet continent to Thrace;

198

Soldiers, that, like the foolish hedge-sparrow,

To their own ruin, hatch this cuckoo peace,

200

Are straight thought burthensome; since want of means,

Growing from want of action, breeds contempt:

202

And that, the worst of ills, falls to their lot,

Their service, with the danger, soon forgot.

204

Enter a Servant.

206

Serv.  The queen, my lord, hath made choice of this room,

208

To see the masque.

210

Eubu.                    I'll be a looker on:

My dancing days are past.

212

Loud music.    

214

Enter Ubaldo, Ricardo, Ferdinand, Honoria,

 Mathias, Sylvia, Acanthe, Baptista, Captains, and 

216

others. As they pass, a Song in praise of war.

218

Ladis.                             This courtesy

To a stranger, my Honoria, keeps fair rank

220

With all your rarities. − After your travail,

Look on our court delights; but first, from your

222

Relation, with erected ears, I'll hear

The music of your war, which must be sweet,

224

Ending in victory.

226

Ferd.                  Not to trouble

Your majesties with description of a battle

228

Too full of horror for the place, and to

Avoid particulars, which should I deliver,

230

I must trench longer on your patience than

My manners will give way to; − in a word, sir,

232

It was well fought on both sides, and almost

With equal fortune, it continuing doubtful

234

Upon whose tents plumed Victory would take

Her glorious stand. Impatient of delay,

236

With the flower of our prime gentlemen, I charged

Their main battalia, and with their assistance

238

Brake in; but, when I was almost assured

That they were routed, by a stratagem

240

Of the subtile Turk, who opening his gross body,

And rallying up his troops on either side,

242

I found myself so far engaged, for I

Must not conceal my errors, that I knew not

244

Which way with honour to come off.

246

Eubu.                                                 I like

A general that tells his faults, and is not

248

Ambitious to engross unto himself

All honour, as some have, in which, with justice,

250

They could not claim a share.

252

Ferd.                                     Being thus hemmed in,

Their scimitars raged among us; and, my horse

254

Killed under me, I every minute looked for

An honourable end, and that was all

256

My hope could fashion to me: circled thus

With death and horror, as one sent from Heaven,

258

This man of men, with some choice horse, that followed

His brave example, did pursue the tract

260

His sword cut for them, and, but that I see him

Already blush to hear what he, being present,

262

I know would wish unspoken, I should say, sir,

By what he did, we boldly may believe

264

All that is writ of Hector.

266

Math.                             General,

Pray spare these strange hyperboles.

268

Eubu.                                               Do not blush

270

To hear a truth; here are a pair of monsieurs,

Had they been in your place, would have run away,

272

And ne'er changed countenance.

274

Ubald.                          We have your good word still.

276

Eubu.  And shall, while you deserve it.

278

Ladis.                                                 Silence; on.

280

Ferd.  He, as I said, like dreadful lightning thrown

From Jupiter's shield, dispersed the armèd gyre

282

With which I was environed; horse and man

Shrunk under his strong arm: more, with his looks

284

Frighted, the valiant fled, with which encouraged,

My soldiers, (like young eaglets preying under

286

The wings of their fierce dam,) as if from him

They took both spirit and fire, bravely came on.

288

By him I was remounted, and inspired

With treble courage; and such as fled before

290

Boldly made head again; and, to confirm them,

It suddenly was apparent, that the fortune

292

Of the day was ours; each soldier and commander

Performed his part; but this was the great wheel

294

By which the lesser moved; and all rewards

And signs of honour, as the civic garland,

296

The mural wreath, the enemy's prime horse,

With the general's sword, and armour, (the old honours

298

With which the Romans crowned their several leaders,)

To him alone are proper.

300

Ladis.                           And they shall

302

Deservedly fall on him. Sit; 'tis our pleasure.

304

Ferd.  Which I must serve, not argue.

306

Hon.                                              You are a stranger,

But, in your service for the king, a native,

308

And, though a free queen, I am bound in duty

To cherish virtue wheresoe'er I find it:

310

This place is yours.

312

Math.                    It were presumption in me

To sit so near you.

314

Hon.                   Not having our warrant.

316

[Music within.]

318

Ladis.  Let the masquers enter: by the preparation,

320

'Tis a French brawl, an apish imitation

Of what you really perform in battaile:

322

And Pallas, bound up in a little volume,

Apollo, with his lute, attending on her,

324

Serve for the induction.

326

Enter two boys, dressed as Apollo with his lute

and Pallas: a Dance; after which a Song by Pallas,

328

in praise of the victorious soldiers.

330

Though we contemplate to express

The glory of your happiness,

332

That, by your powerful arm, have been

So true a victor, that no sin

334

Could ever taint you with a blame

To lessen your deserved fame.

336

Or, though we contend to set

338

Your worth in the full height, or get

Celestial singers, crowned with bays,

340

With flourishes to dress your praise:

You know your conquest; but your story

342

Lives in your triumphant glory.

344

Ladis.                         Our thanks to all.

To the banquet that's prepared to entertain them:

346

[Exeunt Masquers, Apollo, and Pallas.]

348

What would my best Honoria?

350

Hon.                                      May it please

352

My king, that I, who, by his suffrage, ever

Have had power to command, may now entreat

354

An honour from him.

356

Ladis.                     Why should you desire

What is your own? whate'er it be, you are

358

The mistress of it.

360

Hon.                    I am happy in

Your grant: my suit, sir, is, that your commanders,

362

Especially this stranger, may, as I

In my discretion shall think good, receive

364

What's due to their deserts.

366

Ladis.                              What you determine

Shall know no alteratiön.

368

Eubu.                            The soldier

370

Is like to have good usage, when he depends

Upon her pleasure! Are all the men so bad,

372

That, to give satisfaction, we must have

A woman treasurer? Heaven help all!

374

Hon.  [To Mathias]                          With you, sir,

376

I will begin, and, as in my esteem

You are most eminent, expect to have

378

What's fit for me to give, and you to take.

The favour in the quick dispatch being double, −

380

Go fetch my casket, and with speed.

382

[Exit Acanthe.]

384

Eubu.                                              The kingdom

Is very bare of money, when rewards

386

Issue from the queen's jewel-house. Give him gold

And store, no questiön the gentleman wants it. −

388

Good madam, what shall he do with a hoop ring,

And a spark of diamond in it, though you take it,

390

Re-enter Acanthe with a Casket.

392

For the greater honour, from your majesty's finger?

394

'Twill not increase the value. He must purchase

Rich suits, the gay caparisons of courtship,

396

Revel and feast, which, the war ended, is

A soldier's glory; and 'tis fit that way

398

Your bounty should provide for him.

400

Hon.                                                You are rude,

And by your narrow thoughts proportion mine.

402

What I will do now shall be worth the envy

Of Cleopatra. Open it; see here

404

[Honoria descends from the state.]

406

The lapidary's idol! Gold is trash,

408

And a poor salary, fit for grooms; wear these

As studded stars in your armour, and make the sun

410

Look dim with jealousy of a greater light

Than his beams gild the day with: when it is

412

Exposed to view, call it Honoria's gift,

The queen Honoria's gift, that loves a soldier;

414

And, to give ornament and lustre to him,

Parts freely with her own! Yet, not to take

416

From the magnificence of the king, I will

Dispense his bounty too, but as a page

418

To wait on mine; for other tosses, take

A hundred thousand crowns: − your hand, dear sir, −

420

[Takes off the king's signet.]

422

And this shall be thy warrant.

424

Eubu.                                    I perceive

426

I was cheated in this woman: now she is

In the giving vein to soldiers, let her be proud,

428

And the king dote, so she go on, I care not.

430

Hon.  This done, our pleasure is, that all arrearages

Be paid unto the captains, and their troops;

432

With a large donative, to increase their zeal

For the service of the kingdom.

434

Eubu.                                      Better still:

436

Let men of arms be used thus, if they do not

Charge desperately upon the cannon's mouth,

438

Though the devil roared, and fight like dragons, hang me!

Now they may drink sack: but small beer, with a passport

440

To beg with as they travel, and no money,

Turns their red blood to buttermilk.

442

Hon.                                          Are you pleased, sir,

444

With what I have done?

446

Ladis.                         Yes, and thus confirm it,

With this addition of mine own: You have, sir,

448

From our loved queen received some recompense

For your life hazarded in the late action;

450

And, that we may follow her great example

In cherishing valour, without limit ask

452

What you from us can wish.

454

Math.                                  If it be true,

Dread sir, as 'tis affirmed, that every soil,

456

Where he is well, is to a valiant man

His natural country, reason may assure me

458

I should fix here, where blessings beyond hope,

From you, the spring, like rivers, flow unto me.

460

If wealth were my ambition, by the queen

I am made rich already, to the amazement

462

Of all that see, or shall hereafter read

The story of her bounty; if to spend

464

The remnant of my life in deeds of arms,

No region is more fertile of good knights,

466

From whom my knowledge that way may be bettered,

Than this your warlike Hungary; if favour,

468

Or grace in court could take me, by your grant,

Far, far, beyond my merit, I may make

470

In yours a free election; but, alas! sir,

I am not mine own, but by my destiny

472

(Which I cannot resist) forced to prefer

My country's smoke, before the glorious fire

474

With which your bounties warm me. All I ask, sir,

Though I cannot be ignorant it must relish

476

Of foul ingratitude, is your gracious license

For my departure.

478

Ladis.                Whither?

480

Math.                              To my own home, sir,

482

My own poor home; which will, at my return,

Grow rich by your magnificence. I am here

484

But a body without a soul; and, till I find it

In the embraces of my constant wife,

486

And, to set off that constancy, in her beauty

And matchless excellencies without a rival,

488

I am but half myself.

490

Hon.                       And is she then

So chaste and fair as you infer?

492

Math.                                      O, madam,

494

Though it must argue weakness in a rich man,

To shew his gold before an armèd thief,

496

And I, in praising of my wife, but feed

The fire of lust in others to attempt her;

498

Such is my full-sailed confidence in her virtue,

Though in my absence she were now besieged

500

By a strong army of lascivious wooers,

And every one more expert in his art,

502

Than those that tempted chaste Penelope;

Though they raised batteries by prodigal gifts,

504

By amorous letters, vows made for her service,

With all the engines wanton appetite

506

Could mount to shake the fortress of her honour,

Here, here is my assurance she holds out,

508

 [Kisses the picture.]

510

And is impregnable.

512

Hon.                      What's that?

514

Math.                                     Her fair figure.

516

Ladis.  As I live, an excellent face!

518

Hon.                                       You have seen a better.

520

Ladis. I ever except yours: − nay, frown not, sweetest,

522

The Cyprian queen, compared to you, in my

Opinion, is a negro. As you ordered,

524

I'll see the soldiers paid; and, in my absence,

Pray use your powerful arguments, to stay

526

This gentleman in our service.

528

Hon.                                      I will do

My part.

530

Ladis.    On to the camp.

532

[Exeunt Ladislaus, Ferdinand, Eubulus,

534

Baptista, Captains and others.]

536

Hon.  [Aside]              I am full of thoughts,

And something there is here I must give form to,

538

Though yet an embryon: − You, signiors,

Have no business with the soldier, as I take it,

540

You are for other warfare; quit the place,

But be within call.

542

Ric.                    Employment, on my life, boy!

544

Ubald.  If it lie in our road, we are made for ever.

546

[Exeunt Ubaldo and Ricardo.]

548

Hon.  You may perceive the king is no way tainted

550

With the disease of jealousy, since he leaves me

Thus private with you.

552

Math.                         It were in him, madam,

554

A sin unpardonable to distrust such pureness,

Though I were an Adonis.

556

Hon.                                 I presume

558

He neither does nor dares: and yet the story

Delivered of you by the general,

560

With your heroic courage, which sinks deeply

Into a knowing woman's heart, besides

562

Your promising presence, might beget some scruple

In a meaner man; but more of this hereafter.

564

I'll take another theme now, and conjure you

By the honours you have won, and by the love

566

Sacred to your dear wife, to answer truly

To what I shall demand.

568

Math.                           You need not use

570

Charms to this purpose, madam.

572

Hon.                                         Tell me, then,

Being yourself assured 'tis not in man

574

To sully with one spot th' immaculate whiteness

Of your wife's honour, if you have not, since

576

The Gordian of your love was tied by marriage,

Played false with her?

578

Math.                        By the hopes of mercy, never.

580

Hon.  It may be, not frequenting the converse

582

Of handsome ladies, you were never tempted,

And so your faith's untried yet.

584

Math.                                       Surely, madam,

586

I am no woman-hater; I have been

Received to the society of the best

588

And fairest of our climate, and have met with

No common entertainment, yet ne'er felt

590

The least heat that way.

592

Hon.                            Strange! and do you think still,

The earth can show no beauty that can drench

594

In Lethe all remembrance of the favour

You now bear to your own?

596

Math.                                Nature must find out

598

Some other mould to fashion a new creature

Fairer than her Pandora, ere I prove

600

Guilty, or in my wishes or my thoughts,

To my Sophia.

602

Hon.              Sir, consider better;

604

Not one in our whole sex?

606

Math.                               I am constant to

My resolutiön.

608

Hon.              But dare you stand

610

The oppositiön, and bind yourself

By oath for the performance?

612

Math.                                  My faith else

614

Had but a weak foundation.

616

Hon.                                   I take hold

Upon your promise, and enjoin your stay

618

For one month here.

620

Math.  [Aside]       I am caught!

622

Hon.                                       And if I do not

Produce a lady, in that time, that shall

624

Make you confess your error, I submit

Myself to any penalty you shall please

626

To impose upon me: in the mean space, write

To your chaste wife, acquaint her with your fortune:

628

The jewèls that were mine you may send to her,

For better confirmation; I'll provide you

630

Of trusty messengers: but how far distant is she?

632

Math.  A day's hard riding.

634

Hon.                               There is no retiring;

I’ll bind you to your word.

636

Math.                              Well, since there is

638

No way to shun it, I will stand the hazard,

And instantly make ready my dispatch:

640

Till then, I'll leave your majesty.

642

[Exit Mathias.]

644

Hon.                                          How I burst

With envy, that there lives, besides myself,

646

One fair and loyal woman! 'twas the end

Of my ambitiön to be recorded

648

The only wonder of the age, and shall I

Give way to a competitor? Nay, more,

650

To add to my affliction, the assurances

That I placed in my beauty have deceived me:

652

I thought one amorous glance of mine could bring

All hearts to my subjection; but this stranger,

654

Unmoved as rocks, contemns me. But I cannot

Sit down so with mine honour: I will gain

656

A double victory, by working him

To my desire, and taint her in her honour,

658

Or lose myself: I have read that sometime poison

Is useful. − To supplant her, I'll employ,

660

With any cost, Ubaldo and Ricardo,

Two noted courtiers, of approvèd cunning

662

In all the windings of lust's labyrinth;

And in corrupting him, I will outgo

664

Nero's Poppӕa: if he shut his ears

Against my Siren notes, I'll boldly swear

666

Ulysses lives again; or that I have found

A frozen cynic, cold in spite of all

668

Allurements; one whom beauty cannot move,

Nor softest blandishments entice to love.

670

[Exit Honoria.]

ACT III.

SCENE I.

Bohemia.

A Space near the Entrance to Mathias’ House.

Enter Hilario, with a pitcher of water, and a wallet.

1

Hil.  Thin, thin provision! I am dieted

2

Like one set to watch hawks; and, to keep me waking,

My croaking guts make a perpetual larum.

4

Here I stand sentinel; and, though I fright

Beggars from my lady's gate, in hope to have

6

A greater share, I find my commons mend not.

I looked this morning in my glass, the river,

8

And there appeared a fish called a poor John,

Cut with a lenten face, in my own likeness;

10

And it seemed to speak, and say, Good-morrow, cousin!

No man comes this way but has a fling at me:

12

A chirurgeon passing by, asked at what rate

I would sell myself; I answered, For what use?

14

To make, said he, a living anatomy,

And set thee up in our hall, for thou art transparent

16

Without dissection; and, indeed, he had reason,

For I am scoured with this poor purge to nothing.

18

They say that hunger dwells in the camp; but till

My lord returns, or certain tidings of him,

20

He will not part with me: − but sorrow's dry,

And I must drink howsoever.

22

Enter Ubaldo, Ricardo, and a Guide.

24

Guide.                                 That's her castle,

26

Upon my certain knowledge.

28

Ubald.                                  Our horses held out

To my desire. I am afire to be at it.

30

Ric.  Take the jades for thy reward: before I part hence,

32

I hope to be better carried. Give me the cabinet:

So; leave us now.

34

Guide.               Good fortune to you, gallants!

36

[Exit Guide.]

38

Ubald. Being joint agents, in a design of trust too,

40

For the service of the queen, and our own pleasure,

Let us proceed with judgment.

42

Ric.                                         If I take not

44

This fort at the first assault, make me an eunuch,

So I may have precedence.

46

Ubald.                             On no terms.

48

We are both to play one prize; he that works best

In the searching of this mine, shall carry it,

50

Without contention.

52

Ric.                       Make you your approaches

As I directed.

54

Ubald.         I need no instruction;

56

I work not on your anvil. I'll give fire

With mine own linstock; if the powder be dank,

58

The devil rend the touch-hole! Who have we here?

What skeleton's this?

60

Ric.                        A ghost! or the image of famine!

62

Where dost thou dwell?

64

Hil.                             Dwell, sir! my dwelling is

In the highway: that goodly house was once

66

My habitatiön, but I am banished,

And cannot be called home till news arrive

68

Of the good knight Mathias.

70

Ric.                                     If that will

Restore thee, thou art safe.

72

Ubald.                             We come from him,

74

With presents to his lady.

76

Hil.                                 But are you sure

He is in health?

78

Ric.               Never so well: conduct us

80

To the lady.

82

Hil.           Though a poor snake, I will leap

Out of my skin for joy. Break, pitcher, break!

84

And wallet, late my cupboard, I bequeath thee

To the next beggar; thou, red herring, swim

86

To the Red Sea again: methinks I am already

Knuckle deep in the fleshpots; and, though waking, dream

88

Of wine and plenty!

90

Ric.                      What's the mystery

Of this strange passiön?

92

Hil.                            My belly, gentlemen,

94

Will not give me leave to tell you; when I have brought you

To my lady's presence, I am disenchanted:

96

There you shall know all. Follow; if I outstrip you,

Know I run for my belly.

98

Ubald.                           A mad fellow.

100

[Exeunt.]

ACT III, SCENE II.

A Room in Mathias' House.

Enter Sophia and Corisca.

1

Soph.  Do not again delude me.

2

Coris.                                      If I do,

4

Send me a-grazing with my fellow, Hilario.

I stood, as you commanded, in the turret,

6

Observing all that passed by; and even now,

I did discern a pair of cavaliers,

8

For such their outside spoke them, with their guide,

Dismounting from their horses; they said something

10

To our hungry sentinel, that made him caper

And frisk i' the air for joy: and, to confirm this,

12

See, madam, they're in view.

14

Enter Hilario, Ubaldo, and Ricardo.

16

Hil.                                     News from my lord!

Tidings of joy! these are no counterfeits,

18

But knights indeed. Dear madam, sign my pardon,

That I may feed again, and pick up my crumbs;

20

I have had a long fast of it.

22

Soph.                                Eat, I forgive thee.

24

Hil.  O comfortable words! Eat, I forgive thee!

And if in this I do not soon obey you,

26

And ram in to the purpose, billet me again

In the highway. Butler and cook, be ready,

28

For I enter like a tyrant.

30

[Exit Hilario.]

32

Ubald.                         Since mine eyes

Were never happy in so sweet an object,

34

Without inquiry, I presume you are

The lady of the house, and so salute you.

36

Ric. This letter, with these jewèls, from your lord,

38

Warrant my boldness, madam.

40

[Delivers a letter and a casket.]

42

Ubald.                                     In being a servant

To such rare beauty, you must needs deserve

44

This courtesy from a stranger.

46

[Salutes Corisca.]

48

Ric.                                        You are still

Beforehand with me. − Pretty one, I descend

50

To take the height of your lip; and, if I miss

In the altitude, hereafter, if you please,

52

I will make use of my Jacob's staff.

54

[Salutes Corisca.]

56

Coris.                                              These gentlemen

Have certainly had good breeding, as it appears

58

By their neat kissing, they hit me so pat on the lips,

At the first sight.

60

[In the interim, Sophia reads the letter,

62

and opens the casket.]

64

Soph.               Heaven, in thy mercy, make me

Thy thankful handmaid for this boundless blessing,

66

In thy goodness showered upon me!

68

Ubald.                                             I do not like

This simple devotion in her; it is seldom

70

Practised among my mistresses.

72

Ric.                                            Or mine.

Would they kneel to I know not who, for the possession

74

Of such inestimable wealth, before

They thanked the bringers of it? the poor lady

76

Does want instruction, but I'll be her tutor,

And read her another lesson.

78

Soph.                                    If I have

80

Shown want of manners, gentlemen, in my slowness

To pay the thanks I owe you for your travail,

82

To do my lord and me, howe'er unworthy

Of such a benefit, this noble favour,

84

Impute it, in your clemency, to the excess

Of joy that overwhelmed me.

86

Ric.                                       She speaks well.

88

Ubald.  Polite and courtly.

90

Soph.                              And howe'er it may

92

Increase the offence, to trouble you with more

Demands touching my lord, before I have

94

Invited you to taste such as the coarseness

Of my poor house can offer; pray you connive

96

On my weak tenderness, though I entreat

To learn from you something he hath, it may be,

98

In his letter left unmentioned.

100

Ric.                                         I can only

Give you assurance that he is in health,

102

Graced by the king and queen.

104

Ubald.                                   And in the court

With admiration looked on.

106

Ric.                                     You must therefore

108

Put off these widow's garments, and appear

Like to yourself.

110

Ubald.              And entertain all pleasures

112

Your fortune marks out for you.

114

Ric.                                           There are other

Particular privacies, which on occasion

116

I will deliver to you.

118

Soph.                      You oblige me

To your service ever.

120

Ric.                          Good! "your service"; mark that.

122

Soph.  In the mean time, by your good acceptance make

124

My rustic entertainment relish of

The curiousness of the court.

126

Ubald.                                Your looks, sweet madam,

128

Cannot but make each dish a feast.

130

Soph.                                            It shall be

Such, in the freedom of my will to please you.

132

I'll shew you the way; this is too great an honour,

From such brave guests, to me so mean an hostess.

134

[Exeunt.]

ACT III, SCENE III.

Alba Regalis, Hungary.

An Outer-room in the Palace.

Enter Acanthe, and four or five Servants in vizards.

1

Acan.  You know your charge; give it action, and expect

2

Rewards beyond your hopes.

4

1st Serv.                                 If we but eye them,

They are ours, I warrant you.

6

2nd Serv.                                May we not ask why

8

We are put upon this?

10

Acan.                         Let that stop your mouth;

12

[Gives them money.]

14

And learn more manners, groom. 'Tis upon the hour

In which they use to walk here: when you have them

16

In your power, with violence carry them to the place

Where I appointed; there I will expect you:

18

Be bold and careful.

20

[Exit Acanthe.]

22

Enter Mathias and Baptista.

24

1st Serv.                  These are they.

26

2nd Serv.                                        Are you sure?

28

1st Serv.  Am I sure I am myself?

30

2nd Serv.  Cease on him strongly; if he have but means

To draw his sword, 'tis ten to one we smart for't:

32

Take all advantages.

34

Math.                      I cannot guess

What her intents are; but her carriage was

36

As I but now related.

38

Bapt.                       Your assurance

In the constancy of your lady is the armour

40

That must defend you. Where's the picture?

42

Math.                                                           Here,

And no way altered.

44

Bapt.                       If she be not perfit,

46

There is no truth in art.

48

Math.                         By this, I hope,

She hath received my letters.

50

Bapt.                                    Without question:

52

These courtiers are rank riders, when they are

To visit a handsome lady.

54

Math.                               Lend me your ear.

56

One piece of her entertainment will require

Your dearest privacy.

58

1st Serv.                      Now they stand fair;

60

Upon them.

62

[They rush forward.]

64

Math.       Villains!

66

1st Serv.                 Stop their mouths. We come not

To try your valours; kill him if he offer

68

To ope his mouth. − We have you: 'tis in vain

To make resistance. Mount them and away.

70

[Exeunt with Mathias and Baptista.]

ACT III, SCENE IV.

A Gallery in the same.

Enter Servants with lights,

Ladislaus, Ferdinand, and Eubulus.

1

Ladis.   'Tis late. Go to your rest; but do not envy

2

The happiness I draw near to.

4

Eubu.                                    If you enjoy it

The moderate way, the sport yields, I confess,

6

A pretty titillation; but too much of’t

Will bring you on your knees. In my younger days

8

I was myself a gamester; and I found

By sad experience, there is no such soaker

10

As a young spongy wife; she keeps a thousand

Horse-leeches in her box, and the thieves will suck out

12

Both blood and marrow! I feel a kind of cramp

In my joints, when I think on't: but it may be queens,

14

And such a queen as yours is, has the art −

16

Ferd.                                                   You take leave

To talk, my lord.

18

Ladis.                He may, since he can do nothing.

20

Eubu.  If you spend this way too much of your royal stock,

22

Ere long we may be pewfellows.

24

Ladis.                                        The door shut! −

Knock gently; harder. So here comes her woman.

26

Take off my gown.

28

Enter Acanthe.

30

Acan.                   My lord, the queen by me

This night desires your pardon.

32

Ladis.                                      How, Acanthe!

34

I come by her appointment; 'twas her grant;

The motion was her own.

36

Acan.                               It may be, sir;

38

But by her doctors she is since advised,

For her health's sake, to forbear,

40

Eubu.                                         I do not like

42

This physical letchery, the old downright way

Is worth a thousand on't.

44

Ladis.                            Prithee, Acanthe,

46

Mediate for me.

48

[Offering her a ring.]

50

Eubu.             O the fiends of hell!

Would any man bribe his servant, to make way

52

To his own wife? if this be the court state,

Shame fall on such as use it!

54

Acan.                                  By this jewel,

56

This night I dare not move her, but to-morrow

I will watch all occasiöns.

58

Ladis.                              Take this,

60

To be mindful of me.

62

[Exit Acanthe.]

64

Eubu.                       'Slight, I thought a king

Might have ta'en up any woman at the king's price.

66

And must he buy his own, at a dearer rate

Than a stranger in a brothel?

68

Ladis.                                 What is that

70

You mutter, sir?

72

Eubu.              No treason to your honour:

I'll speak it out, though it anger you; if you pay for

74

Your lawful pleasure in some kind, great sir,

What do you make the queen? cannot you clicket

76

Without a fee, or when she has a suit

For you to grant?

78

[Ladislaus draws his sword.]

80

Ferd.              O hold, sir!

82

Ladis.                             Off with his head!

84

Eubu.  Do, when you please; you but blow out a taper

86

That would light your understanding, and, in care of’t,

Is burnt down to the socket. Be as you are, sir,

88

An absolute monarch: it did show more king-like

In those libidinous Caesars, that compelled

90

Matrons and virgins of all ranks to bow

Unto their ravenous lusts; and did admit

92

Of more excuse than I can urge for you,

That slave yourself to the imperious humour

94

Of a proud beauty.

96

Ladis.                   Out of my sight!

98

Eubu.                                            I will, sir,

Give way to your furious passion; but when reason

100

Hath got the better of it, I much hope

The counsaile that offends now will deserve

102

Your royal thanks. Tranquillity of mind

Stay with you, sir! − [Aside] I do begin to doubt

104

There's something more in the queen's strangeness than

Is yet disclosed; and I will find it out,

106

Or lose myself in the search.

108

[Exit.]

110

Ferd.                                    Sure he is honest,

And from your infancy hath truly served you:

112

Let that plead for him; and impute this harshness

To the frowardness of his age.

114

Ladis.                                     I am much troubled,

116

And do begin to stagger. Ferdinand, good night!

To-morrow visit us. Back to our own lodgings.

118

[Exeunt.]

ACT III, SCENE V.

Another Room in the same.

Enter Acanthe and the vizarded Servants,

with Mathias and Baptista blindfolded.

1

Acan.  You have done bravely. Lock this in that room,

2

There let him ruminate; I'll anon unhood him:

4

[They carry off Baptista.]

6

The other must stay here. As soon as I

Have quit the place, give him the liberty

8

And use of his eyes; that done, disperse yourselves

As privately as you can: but, on your lives,

10

No word of what hath passed.

12

[Exit Acanthe.]

14

1 Serv.                                   If I do, sell

My tongue to a tripe-wife. − Come, unbind his arms: −

16

You are now at your own disposure; and however

We used you roughly, I hope you will find here

18

Such entertainment as will give you cause

To thank us for the service: and so I leave you.

20

[Exeunt Servants.]

22

Math.  If I am in prison, 'tis a neat one.

24

What Oedipus can resolve this riddle? Ha!

I never gave just cause to any man

26

Basely to plot against my life: − but what is

Become of my true friend? for him I suffer

28

More than myself.

30

Acan.  [within]   Remove that idle fear;

He's safe as you are.

32

Math.                    Whosoe'er thou art,

34

For him I thank thee. I cannot imagine

Where I should be: though I have read the tales

36

Of errant-knighthood, stuffed with the relations

Of magical enchantments; yet I am not

38

So sottishly credulous to believe the devil

Hath that way power.

40

[Music above.]

42

                                Ha! Music!

44

[Singing from above, a song of pleasure.]

46

          The blushing rose, and purple flower,

48

               Let grow too long, are soonest blasted;

          Dainty fruits, though sweet, will sour,

50

               And rot in ripeness, left untasted.

          Yet here is one more sweet than these:

52

          The more you taste the more she'll please.

54

          Beauty that's enclosed with ice,

               Is a shadow chaste as rare;

56

          Then how much those sweets entice,

               That have issue full as fair!

58

          Earth cannot yield, from all her powers,

          One equal for dame Venus' bowers.

60

Math.  A song too! certainly, be it he or she

62

That owes this voice, it hath not been acquainted

With much affliction. Whosoe'er you are

64

That do inhabit here, if you have bodies,

And are not mere aërial forms, appear,

66

Enter Honoria, masked.

68

And make me know your end with me. Most strange!

70

What have I conjured up? sure, if this be

A spirit, it is no damned one. What a shape's here!

72

Then, with what majesty it moves! If Juno

Were now to keep her state among the gods,

74

And Hercules to be made again her guest,

She could not put on a more glorious habit,

76

Though her handmaid, Iris, lent her various colours,

Or old Oceanus ravished from the deep

78

All jewèls shipwracked in it. − As you have

Thus far made known yourself, if that your face

80

Have not too much divinity about it

For mortal eyes to gaze on, pérfit what

82

You have begun, with wonder and amazement

To my astonished senses.

84

[Honoria pulls off her mask.]

86

                                      How! the queen!

88

 [Kneels.]

90

Hon.  Rise, sir, and hear my reasons, in defence

92

Of the rape (for so you may conceive) which I,

By my instruments, made upon you. You, perhaps,

94

May think what you have suffered for my lust

Is a common practice with me; but I call

96

Those ever-shining lamps, and their great Maker,

As witnesses of my innocence: I ne'er looked on

98

A man but your best self, on whom I ever

(Except the king) vouchsafed an eye of favour.

100

Math.  The king, indeed, and only such a king,

102

Deserves your rarities, madam; and, but he,

'Twere giant-like ambitiön in any,

104

In his wishes only, to presume to taste

The nectar of your kisses; or to feed

106

His appetite with that ambrosia, due

And proper to a prince; and, what binds more,

108

A lawful husband. For myself, great queen,

I am a thing obscure, disfurnished of

110

All merit that can raise me higher than,

In my most humble thankfulness for your bounty,

112

To hazard my life for you; and, that way,

I am most ambitious.

114

Hon.                        I desire no more

116

Than what you promise. If you dare expose

Your life, as you profess, to do me service,

118

How can it be better employed than in

Preserving mine? which only you can do,

120

And must do, with the danger of your own;

A desperate danger too! If private men

122

Can brook no rivals in what they affect,

But to the death pursue such as invade

124

What law makes their inheritance; the king,

To whom you know I am dearer than his crown,

126

His health, his eyes, his after hopes, with all

His present blessings, must fall on that man,

128

Like dreadful lightning, that is won by prayers,

Threats, or rewards, to stain his bed, or make

130

His hoped-for issue doubtful.

132

Math.                                    If you aim

At what I more than fear you do, the reasons

134

Which you deliver, should, in judgment, rather

Deter me, than invite a grant, with my

136

Assurèd ruin.

138

Hon.           True; if that you were

Of a cold temper, one whom doubt, or fear,

140

In the most horrid forms they could put on,

Might teach to be ingrateful. Your denial

142

To me, that have deserved so much, is more,

If it can have addition.

144

Math.                         I know not

146

What your commands are.

148

Hon.                                Have you fought so well

Among armed men, yet cannot guess what lists

150

You are to enter, when you are in private

With a willing lady: one, that, to enjoy

152

Your company this night, denied the king

Access to what's his own? If you will press me

154

To speak in plainer language −

156

Math.                                    Pray you, forbear;

I would I did not understand too much!

158

Already, by your words, I am instructed

To credit that, which, not confirmed by you,

160

Had bred suspicion in me of untruth,

Though an angel had affirmed it. But suppose

162

That, cloyed with happiness, which is ever built

On virtuous chastity, in the wantonness

164

Of appetite, you desire to make trial

Of the false delights proposed by vicious lust;

166

Among ten thousand, every way more able

And apter to be wrought on, such as owe you

168

Obedience, being your subjects, why should you

Make choice of me, a stranger?

170

Hon.                                        Though yet reason

172

Was ne'er admitted in the court of love,

I'll yield you one unanswerable. As I urged,

174

In our last private conference, you have

A pretty promising presence; but there are

176

Many, in limbs and feature, who may take,

That way, the right-hand file of you: besides,

178

Your May of youth is past, and the blood spent

By wounds, though bravely taken, renders you

180

Disabled for love's service: and that valour

Set off with better fortune, which, it may be,

182

Swells you above your bounds, is not the hook

That hath caught me, good sir. I need no champion,

184

With his sword, to guard my honour or my beauty;

In both I can defend myself, and live

186

My own protection.

188

Math.                     If these advocates,

The best that can plead for me, have no power,

190

What can you find in me else, that may tempt you,

With irrecoverable loss unto yourself,

192

To be a gainer from me?

194

Hon.                             You have, sir,

A jewèl of such matchless worth and lustre,

196

As does disdain comparison, and darkens

All that is rare in other men; and that

198

I must or win or lessen.

200

Math.                          You heap more

Amazement on me: What am I possessed of

202

That you can covet? make me understand it,

If it have a name.

204

Hon.                  Yes, an imagined one;

206

But is, in substance, nothing; being a garment

Worn out of fashion, and long since given o'er

208

By the court and country: 'tis your loyalty

And constancy to your wife; 'tis that I dote on,

210

And does deserve my envy: and that jewel,

Or by fair play or foul, I must win from you.

212

Math.  These are mere contraries. If you love me, madam,

214

For my constancy, why seek you to destroy it?

In my keeping it, preserve me worth your favour.

216

Or, if it be a jewèl of that value,

As you with laboured rhetoric would persuade me,

218

What can you stake against it?

220

Hon.                                      A queen's fame,

And equal honour.

222

Math.                  So, whoever wins,

224

Both shall be losers.

226

Hon.                      That is that I aim at:

Yet on the die I lay my youth, my beauty,

228

This moist palm, this soft lip, and those delights

Darkness should only judge of.

230

[Kisses him.]

232

                                                Do you find them

234

Infectious in the trial, that you start,

As frighted with their touch?

236

Math.                                   Is it in man

238

To resist such strong temptations?

240

Hon.  [Aside]                              He begins

To waver.

242

Math.  Madam, as you are gracious,

244

Grant this short night's deliberation to me;

And, with the rising sun, from me you shall

246

Receive full satisfaction.

248

Hon.                             Though extremes

Hate all delay, I will deny you nothing;

250

This key will bring you to your friend; you are safe both;

And all things useful that could be prepared

252

For one I love and honour, wait upon you.

Take counsaile of your pillow, such a fortune

254

As with affection's swiftest wings flies to you,

Will not be often tendered.

256

[Exit Honoria.]

258

Math.                               How my blood

260

Rebels! I now could call her back − and yet

There's something stays me: if the king had tendered

262

Such favours to my wife, 'tis to be doubted

They had not been refused: but, being a man,

264

I should not yield first, or prove an example

For her defence of frailty. By this, sans question,

266

She's tempted too; and here I may examine

268

[Looks on the picture.]

270

How she holds out. She's still the same, the same

Pure crystal rock of chastity. Perish all

272

Allurements that may alter me! The snow

Of her sweet coldness hath extinguished quite

274

The fire that but even now began to flame:

And I by her confirmed, − rewards nor titles,

276

Nor certain death from the refusèd queen,

Shall shake my faith; since I resolve to be

278

Loyal to her, as she is true to me.

280

[Exit Mathias.]

ACT III, SCENE VI.

Bohemia.

A Gallery in Mathias' House.

Enter Ubaldo and Ricardo.

1

Ubald.  What we spake on the volley begins to work;

2

We have laid a good foundation.

4

Ric.                                            Build it up,

Or else 'tis nothing: you have by lot the honour

6

Of the first assault; but, as it is conditioned,

Observe the time proportioned: I'll not part with

8

My share in the achievement: when I whistle,

Or hem, fall off.

10

Enter Sophia.

12

Ubald.              She comes. Stand by, I'll watch

14

My opportunity.

16

[They walk aside.]

18

Soph.                I find myself

Strangely distracted with the various stories,

20

Now well, now ill, then doubtfully, by my guests

Delivered of my lord: and, like poor beggars

22

That in their dreams find treasure, by reflection

Of a wounded fancy, make it questionable

24

Whether they sleep or not; yet, tickled with

Such a fantastic hope of happiness,

26

Wish they may never wake. In some such measure,

Incredulous of what I see and touch,

28

As 'twere a fading apparition, I

Am still perplexed, and troubled; and when most

30

Confirmed 'tis true, a curious jealousy

To be assured, by what means, and from whom,

32

Such a mass of wealth was first deserved, then gotten,

Cunningly steals into me. I have practised,

34

For my certain resolution, with these courtiers.

Promising private conference to either,

36

And, at this hour: if in search of the truth,

I hear, or say, more than becomes my virtue,

38

Forgive me, my Mathias.

40

Ubald.                            Now I make in. −

42

[Comes forward.]

44

Madam, as you commanded, I attend

Your pleasure.

46

Soph.              I must thank you for the favour.

48

Ubald.  I am no ghostly father; yet, if you have

50

Some scruples touching your lord you would be resolved of,

I am prepared.

52

Soph.             But will you take your oath,

54

To answer truly?

56

Ubald.         On the hem of your smock, if you please,

A vow I dare not break, it being a book

58

I would gladly swear on.

60

Soph.                            To spare, sir, that trouble,

I'll take your word, which, in a gentleman,

62

Should be of equal value. Is my lord, then,

In such grace with the queen?

64

Ubald.                                   You should best know,

66

By what you have found from him, whether he can

Deserve a grace or no.

68

Soph.                        What grace do you mean?

70

Ubald.  That special grace, if you will have it, he

72

Laboured so hard for between a pair of sheets,

Upon your wedding night, when your ladyship

74

Lost you know what.

76

Soph.                        Fie! be more modest,

Or I must leave you.

78

Ubald.                     I would tell a truth

80

As cleanly as I could, and yet the subject

Makes me run out a little.

82

Soph.                               You would put, now,

84

A foolish jealousy in my head, my lord

Hath gotten a new mistress.

86

Ubald.                                 One! a hundred;

88

But under seal I speak it: I presume

Upon your silence, it being for your profit.

90

They talk of Hercules' fifty in a night,

Twas well; but yet to yours he was a piddler:

92

Such a soldier and a courtier never came

To Alba Regalis; the ladies run mad for him,

94

And there is such contentiön among them,

Who shall engross him wholly, that the like

96

Was never heard of.

98

Soph.                      Are they handsome women?

100

Ubald.  Fie! no; coarse mammets: and what's worse, they are old too,

Some fifty, some threescore, and they pay dear for't,

102

Believing that he carries a powder in his breeches

Will make them young again; and these suck shrewdly.

104

[Ricardo whistles]

106

Ric.  [Aside to Ubaldo]

108

Sir, I must fetch you off.

110

Ubald.                        I could tell you wonders

Of the cures he has done, but a business of import

112

Calls me away; but, that dispatched, I will

Be with you presently.

114

[Steps aside.]

116

Soph.                         There is something more

118

In this than bare suspicion.

120

Ric.  [Comes forward]     Save you, lady;

Now you look like yourself! I have not looked on

122

A lady more complete, yet have seen a madam

Wear a garment of this fashion, of the same stuff too,

124

One just of your dimensions: sat the wind there, boy!

126

Soph.  What lady, sir?

128

Ric.                           Nay, nothing; and methinks

I should know this ruby: very good! 'tis the same.

130

This chain of orient pearl, and this diamond too,

Have been worn before; but much good may they do you!

132

Strength to the gentleman's back! he toiled hard for them

Before he got them.

134

Soph.                    Why, how were they gotten?

136

Ric.  Not in the field with his sword, upon my life;

138

He may thank his close stiletto. −

140

[Ubaldo hems.]

142

                                − [Aside] Plague upon it!

Run the minutes so fast? − Pray you, excuse my manners;

144

I left a letter in my chamber window,

Which I would not have seen on any terms; fie on it,

146

Forgetful as I am! but I'll straight attend you.

148

[Steps aside.]

150

Soph.  This is strange. His letters said these jewèls were

Presented him by the queen, as a reward

152

For his good service, and the trunks of clothes

That followed them this last night, with haste made up

154

By his direction.

156

Ubald.  [Comes forward] I was telling you

Of wonders, madam.

158

Soph.                        If you are so skilful,

160

Without premeditation answer me;

Know you this gown, and these rich jewèls?

162

Ubald.                                                         Heaven,

164

How things will come out! But that I should offend you,

And wrong my more than noble friend your husband,

166

(For we are sworn brothers,) in the discovery

Of his nearest secrets, I could −

168

Soph.                                      By the hope of favour

170

That you have from me, out with it.

172

Ubald.                                             'Tis a potent spell

I cannot resist; why, I will tell you, madam,

174

And to how many several women you are

Beholding for your bravery. This was

176

The wedding gown of Paulina, a rich strumpet,

Worn but a day, when she married old Gonzaga,

178

And left off trading.

180

Soph.                     O my heart!

182

Ubald.                                     This chain

Of pearl was a great widow's, that invited

184

Your lord to a masque, and the weather proving foul,

He lodged in her house all night, and merry they were;

186

But how he came by it, I know not.

188

Soph.                                              Perjured man!

190

Ubald.  This ring was Julietta's, a fine piece,

But very good at the sport: this diamond

192

Was madam Acanthe's, given him for a song

Pricked in a private arbour, as she said,

194

When the queen asked for't; and she hard him sing too,

And danced to his hornpipe, or there are liars abroad.

196

There are other toys about you the same way purchased;

But, paralleled with these, not worth the relation.

198

You are happy in a husband, never man

Made better use of his strength: would you have him waste

200

His body away for nothing? if he holds out,

There's not an embroidered petticoat in the court,

202

But shall be at your service.

204

Soph.                                   I commend him,

It is a thriving trade; but pray you leave me

206

A little to myself.

208

Ubald.               You may command

Your servant, madam. −

210

[Steps aside.]

212

                                   She's stung unto the quick, lad.

214

Ric.  I did my part; if this potion work not, hang me!

216

Let her sleep as well as she can to-night, tomorrow

We'll mount new batteries.

218

Ubald.                              And till then leave her.

220

[Exeunt Ubaldo and Ricardo.]

222

Soph.  You Powers, that take into your care the guard

224

Of innocence, aid me! for I am a creature

So forfeited to despair, hope cannot fancy

226

A ransom to redeem me. I begin

To waver in my faith, and make it doubtful,

228

Whether the saints, that were canónized for

Their holiness of life, sinned not in secret;

230

Since my Mathias is fallen from his virtue

In such an open fashion. Could it be, else,

232

That such a husband, so devoted to me,

So vowed to temperance, for lascivious hire

234

Should prostitute himself to common harlots!

Old and deformed too! Was't for this he left me,

236

And on a feigned pretence, for want of means

To give me ornament? − or to bring home

238

Diseases to me? Suppose these are false,

And lustful goats; if he were true and right,

240

Why stays he so long from me, being made rich,

And that the only reason why he left me?

242

No, he is lost; and shall I wear the spoils

And salaries of lust! they cleave unto me

244

Like Nessus' poisoned shirt: no, in my rage

I'll tear them off, and from my body wash

246

The venom with my tears. Have I no spleen,

Nor anger of a woman? shall he build

248

Upon my ruins, and I, unrevenged,

Deplore his falsehood? no; with the same trash

250

For which he had dishonoured me, I'll purchase

A just revenge: I am not yet so much

252

In debt to years, nor so mis-shaped, that all

Should fly from my embraces: Chastity,

254

Thou only art a name, and I renounce thee!

I am now a servant to voluptuousness.

256

Wantons of all degrees and fashions, welcome!

You shall be entertained; and, if I stray,

258

Let him condemn himself, that led the way.

260

[Exit.]

ACT IV.

SCENE I.

Alba Regalis, Hungary.

A Room in the Palace.

Enter Mathias and Baptista.

1

Bapt.  We are in a desperate strait; there's no evasion,

2

Nor hope left to come off, but by your yielding

To the necessity; you must feign a grant

4

To her violent passion, or −

6

Math.                             What, my Baptista?

8

Bapt.  We are but dead else.

10

Math.                         Were the sword now heaved up,

And my neck upon the block, I would not buy

12

An hour's reprieve with the loss of faith and virtue,

To be made immortal here. Art thou a scholar,

14

Nay, almost without parallel, and yet fear

To die, which is inevitable! You may urge

16

The many years that, by the course of nature,

We may travel in this tedious pilgrimage,

18

And hold it as a blessing; as it is,

When innocence is our guide: yet know, Baptista,

20

Our virtues are preferred before our years,

By the great Judge: to die untainted in

22

Our fame and reputation is the greatest;

And to lose that, can we desire to live?

24

Or shall I, for a momentary pleasure,

Which soon comes to a period, to all times

26

Have breach of faith and perjury remembered

In a still-living epitaph? no, Baptista,

28

Since my Sophia will go to her grave

Unspotted in her faith, I'll follow her

30

With equal loyalty: −

32

[Takes out the picture.]

34

                             But look on this,

Your own great work, your masterpiece, and then,

36

She being still the same, teach me to alter! −

Ha! sure I do not sleep! or, if I dream,

38

This is a terrible vision! I will clear

My eyesight; perhaps melancholy makes me

40

See that which is not.

42

Bapt.                         It is too apparent.

I grieve to look upon't: besides the yellow,

44

That does assure she's tempted, there are lines

Of a dark colour, that disperse themselves

46

O'er every miniature of her face, and those

Confirm −

48

Math.   She is turned whore!

50

Bapt.                                    I must not say so.

52

Yet, as a friend to truth, if you will have me

Interpret it, in her consent and wishes

54

She's false, but not in fact yet.

56

Math.                                     Fact, Baptista!

Make not yourself a pander to her looseness,

58

In labouring to palliate what a visor

Of impudence cannot cover. Did e'er woman

60

In her will decline from chastity, but found means

To give her hot lust fuël? It is more

62

Impossible in nature for gross bodies,

Descending of themselves, to hang in the air;

64

Or with my single arm to underprop

A falling tower; nay, in its violent course

66

To stop the lightning, than to stay a woman

Hurried by two furies, lust and falsehood,

68

In her full career to wickedness!

70

Bapt.                                         Pray you, temper

The violence of your passion.

72

Math.                                     In extremes

74

Of this condition, can it be in man

To use a moderation? I am thrown

76

From a steep rock headlong into a gulf

Of misery, and find myself past hope,

78

In the same moment that I apprehend

That I am falling: and this, the figure of

80

My idol, few hours since, while she continued

In her perfection, that was late a mirror,

82

In which I saw miraculous shapes of duty,

Staid manners with all excellency a husband

84

Could wish in a chaste wife, is on the sudden

Turned to a magical glass, and does present

86

Nothing but horns and horror.

88

Bapt.                                      You may yet,

And 'tis the best foundation, build up comfort

90

On your own goodness.

92

Math.                           No, that hath undone me;

For now I hold my temperance a sin

94

Worse than excess, and what was vice, a virtue.

Have I refused a queen, and such a queen,

96

Whose ravishing beauties at the first sight had tempted

A hermit from his beads, and changed his prayers

98

To amorous sonnets, to preserve my faith

Inviolate to thee, with the hazard of

100

My death with torture, since she could inflict

No less for my contempt; and have I met

102

Such a return from thee! I will not curse thee,

Nor, for thy falsehood, rail against the sex;

104

Tis poor, and common: I'll only, with wise men,

Whisper unto myself, howe'er they seem,

106

Nor present, nor past times, nor the age to come,

Hath heretofore, can now, or ever shall,

108

Produce one constant woman.

110

Bapt.                                      This is more

Than the satirists wrote against them.

112

Math.                                           There's no language

114

That can express the poison of these aspics,

These weeping crocodiles, and all too little

116

That hath been said against them. But I'll mould

My thoughts into another form; and, if

118

She can outlive the report of what I have done,

This hand, when next she comes within my reach,

120

Shall be her executioner.

122

Enter Honoria and Acanthe.

124

Bapt.                             The queen, sir.

126

Hon.  Wait our command at distance: −

128

[Exit Acanthe.]

130

                                                      − Sir, you too have

Free liberty to depart.

132

Bapt.                          I know my manners,

134

And thank you for the favour.

136

[Exit Baptista.]

138

Hon.                                       Have you taken

Good rest in your new lodgings? I expect now

140

Your resolute answer; but advise maturely,

Before I hear it.

142

Math.              Let my actions, madam,

144

For no words can dilate my joy, in all

You can command, with cheerfulness to serve you,

146

Assure your highness; and, in sign of my

Submission and contrition for my error,

148

My lips, that but the last night shunned the touch

Of yours as poison, taught humility now,

150

Thus on your foot, and that too great an honour

For such an undeserver, seal my duty.

152

A cloudy mist of ignorance, equal to

Cimmerian darkness, would not let me see, then,

154

What now, with adoratiön and wonder,

With reverence I look up to: but those fogs

156

Dispersed and scattered by the powerful beams

With which yourself, the sun of all perfection,

158

Vouchsafe to cure my blindness; like a suppliant,

As low as I can kneel, I humbly beg

160

What you once pleased to tender.

162

Hon.  [Aside]                               This is more

Than I could hope! − What find you so attractive

164

Upon my face, in so short time to make

This sudden metamorphosis? pray you, rise;

166

I, for your late neglect, thus sign your pardon.

168

[Kisses him.]

170

Ay, now you kiss like a lover, and not as brothers

Coldly salute their sisters.

172

Math.                               I am turned

174

All spirit and fire.

176

Hon.                   Yet, to give some allay

To this hot fervour, 'twere good to remember

178

The king, whose eyes and ears are everywhere;

With the danger too that follows, this discovered.

180

Math.  Danger! a bugbear, madam; let me ride once

182

Like Phaeton in the chariot of your favour,

And I contemn Jove's thunder: though the king,

184

In our embraces stood a looker on,

His hangman, and with studied cruelty, ready

186

To drag me from your arms, it should not fright me

From the enjoying that a single life is

188

Too poor a price for. O, that now all vigour

Of my youth were re-collected for an hour,

190

That my desire might meet with yours, and draw

The envy of all men, in the encounter,

192

Upon my head! I should − but we lose time;

Be gracious, mighty queen.

194

Hon.                                  Pause yet a little:

196

The bounties of the king, and, what weighs more,

Your boasted constancy to your matchless wife,

198

Should not so soon be shaken.

200

Math.                                     The whole fabric,

When I but look on you, is in a moment

202

O'erturned and ruined; and, as rivers lose

Their names when they are swallowed by the ocean,

204

In you alone all faculties of my soul

Are wholly taken up; my wife and king,

206

At the best, as things forgotten.

208

Hon.  [Aside]                            Can this be?

I have gained my end now.

210

Math.                           Wherefore stay you, madam?

212

Hon.  In my consideration what a nothing

214

Man's constancy is.

216

Math.                    Your beauties make it so

In me, sweet lady.

218

Hon.                    And it is my glory:

220

I could be coy now, as you were, but I

Am of a gentler temper; howsoever,

222

And in a just return of what I have suffered

In your disdain, with the same measure grant me

224

Equal deliberation: I ere long

Will visit you again; and when I next

226

Appear, as conquered by it, slave-like wait

On my triumphant beauty.

228

[Exit Honoria.]

230

Math.                              What a change

232

Is here beyond my fear! but by thy falsehood,

Sophia, not her beauty, is't denied me

234

To sin but in my wishes? what a frown,

In scorn, at her departure, she threw on me!

236

I am both ways lost; storms of contempt and scorn

Are ready to break on me, and all hope

238

Of shelter doubtful: I can neither be

Disloyal, nor yet honest; I stand guilty

240

On either part; at the worst, Death will end all;

And he must be my judge to right my wrong,

242

Since I have loved too much, and lived too long.

244

[Exit Mathias.]

ACT IV, SCENE II.

Bohemia.

A Room in Mathias' House.

Enter Sophia, with a book and a note.

1

Soph.  Nor custom, nor example, nor vast numbers

2

Of such as do offend, make less the sin.

For each particular crime a strict account

4

Will be exacted; and that comfort which

The damned pretend, fellows in misery,

6

Takes nothing from their torments: every one

Must suffer in himself the measure of

8

His wickedness. If so, as I must grant,

It being unrefutable in reason,

10

Howe'er my lord offend, it is no warrant

For me to walk in his forbidden paths:

12

What penance then can expiate my guilt,

For my consent (transported then with passion)

14

To wantonness? the wounds I give my fame

Cannot recover his; and, though I have fed

16

These courtiers with promises and hopes,

I am yet in fact untainted, and I trust

18

My sorrow for it, with my purity,

And love to goodness for itself, made powerful,

20

Though all they have alleged prove true or false,

Will be such exorcisms as shall command

22

This fury, jealousy, from me. What I have

Determined touching them, I am resolved

24

To put in execution. − Within, there!

26

Enter Hilario, Corisca, with other Servants.

28

Where are my noble guests?

30

Hil.                                     The elder, madam,

Is drinking by himself to your ladyship's health,

32

In muskadine and eggs; and, for a rasher

To draw his liquor down, he hath got a pie

34

Of marrowbones, potatoes, and eringos,

With many such ingredients; and, 'tis said,

36

He hath sent his man in post to the next town

For a pound of ambergris, and half a peck

38

Of fishes called cantharides.

40

Coris.                                  The younger

Prunes up himself, as if this night he were

42

To act a bridegroom's part; but to what purpose,

I am ignorance itself.

44

Soph.                       Continue so.

46

[Gives the servants the note.]

48

Let those lodgings be prepared as this directs you:

50

And fail not in a circumstance, as you

Respect my favour.

52

1st Serv.                  We have our instructions.

54

2nd Serv.  And punctually will follow them.

56

[Exeunt Servants.]

58

Enter Ubaldo.

60

Hil.                                              Here comes, madam,

62

The lord Ubaldo.

64

Ubald.  [To Corisca] Pretty one, there's gold

To buy thee a new gown;

66

                   [To Hilario] and there's for thee;

Grow fat, and fit for service. − I am now,

68

As I should be, at the height, and able to

Beget a giant. O my better angel!

70

In this you shew your wisdom, when you pay

The letcher in his own coin; shall you sit puling,

72

Like a patient grizzle, and be laughed at? no:

This is a fair revenge. Shall we to't?

74

Soph.                                              To what, sir?

76

Ubald.  The sport you promised.

78

Soph.                             Could it be done with safety?

80

Ubald.  I warrant you; I am sound as a bell, a tough

82

Old blade, and steel to the back, as you shall find me

In the trial on your anvil.

84

Soph.                             So; but how, sir,

86

Shall I satisfy your friend, to whom, by promise,

I am equally engaged?

88

Ubald.                       I must confess,

90

The more the merrier; but, of all men living,

Take heed of him; you may safer run upon

92

The mouth of a cannon when it is unlading,

And come off colder.

94

Soph.                       How! is he not wholesome?

96

Ubald.  Wholesome! I'll tell you, for your good: he is

98

A spittle of diseases, and, indeed,

More loathsome and infectiöus; the tub is

100

His weekly bath: he hath not drank this seven years,

Before he came to your house, but compositions

102

Of sassafras and guiacum; and dry mutton

His daily portion; name what scratch soever

104

Can be got by women, and the surgeons will resolve you,

At this time or at that Ricardo had it.

106

Soph.  Bless me from him!

108

Ubald.                             'Tis a good prayer, lady,

110

It being a degree unto the pox

Only to mention him: if my tongue burn not, hang me,

112

When I but name Ricardo.

114

Soph.                                Sir, this caution

Must be rewarded.

116

Ubald.  [Aside]    I hope I have marred his market, −

118

But when?

120

Soph.      Why, presently; follow my woman,

She knows where to conduct you, and will serve

122

To-night for a page. Let the waistcoat I appointed,

With the cambric shirt perfumed, and the rich cap,

124

Be brought into his chamber.

126

Ubald.                                  Excellent lady!

And a caudle too in the morning.

128

Coris.                                          I will fit you.

130

[Exeunt Ubaldo and Corisca.]

132

Enter Ricardo.

134

Soph.  So hot on the scent! Here comes the other beagle.

136

Ric.  [To Hilario]

138

Take purse and all.

140

Hil.                        If this company would come often,

I should make a pretty term on't.

142

Soph.                                          For your sake

144

I have put him off; he only begged a kiss,

I gave it, and so parted.

146

Ric.                              I hope better:

148

He did not touch your lips?

150

Soph.                                Yes, I assure you.

There was no danger in it?

152

Ric.                                No! eat presently

154

These lozenges of forty crowns an ounce,

Or you are undone.

156

Soph.                   What is the virtue of them?

158

Ric.  They are preservatives against stinking breath,

160

Rising from rotten lungs.

162

Soph.                              If so, your carriage

Of such dear antidotes, in my opinion,

164

May render yours suspected.

166

Ric.                                      Fie! no; I use them

When I talk with him, I should be poisoned else,

168

But I'll be free with you: he was once a creature,

It may be, of God's making, but long since

170

He is turned to a druggist's shop; the spring and fall

Hold all the year with him; that he lives, he owes

172

To art, not nature; she has given him o'er.

He moves like the fairy king, on screws and wheels,

174

Made by his doctor's recipes, and yet still

They are out of joint, and every day repairing.

176

He has a regiment of whores he keeps

At his own charge in a lazar-house; but the best is,

178

There's not a nose among them. He's acquainted

With the green water, and the spitting pill's

180

Familiar to him: in a frosty morning

You may thrust him in a pottle-pot; his bones

182

Rattle in his skin, like beans tossed in a bladder.

If he but hear a coach, the fomentation,

184

The friction with fumigation, cannot save him

From the chine-evil. In a word, he is

186

Not one disease, but all; yet, being my friend,

I will forbear his character, for I would not

188

Wrong him in your opiniön.

190

Soph.                                  The best is,

The virtues you bestow on him, to me

192

Are mysteries I know not; but, however,

I am at your service. − Sirrah, let it be your care

194

To unclothe the gentleman, and with speed; delay

Takes from delight.

196

Ric.                       Good! there's my hat, sword, cloak:

198

A vengeance on these buttons! off with my doublet,

I dare shew my skin; in the touch you will like it better. −

200

Prithee cut my codpiece-points, and, for this service,

When I leave them off, they are thine.

202

Hil.                                          I'll take your word, sir.

204

Ric.  Dear lady, stay not long.

206

Soph.                                    I may come too soon, sir.

208

Ric.  No, no; I am ready now.

210

Hil.                                       This is the way, sir.

212

[Exeunt Hilario and Ricardo.]

214

Soph.  I was much to blame to credit their reports

216

Touching my lord, that so traduce each other,

And with such virulent malice, though I presume

218

They are bad enough: but I have studied for them

A way for their recovery.

220

[A noise of clapping a door;

222

Ubaldo appears above, in his shirt.]

224

Ubald.                          What dost thou mean, wench?

Why dost thou shut the door upon me? Ha!

226

My clothes are ta'en away too! shall I starve here?

Is this my lodging? I am sure the lady talked of

228

A rich cap, a perfumed shirt, and a waistcoat;

But here is nothing but a little fresh straw,

230

A petticoat for a coverlet, and that torn too,

And an old woman's biggin for a night-cap.

232

Re-enter Corisca below.

234

'Slight, 'tis a prison, or a pigsty. Ha!

236

The windows grated with iron! I cannot force them,

And if I leap down here, I break my neck;

238

I am betrayed. Rogues! Villains! let me out;

I am a lord, and that's no common title,

240

And shall I be used thus?

242

Soph.                             Let him rave, he's fast;

I'll parley with him at leisure.

244

Ricardo entering with a great noise above, as fallen.

246

Ric.                                Zounds! have you trapdoors?

248

Soph.  The other bird's i' the cage too, let him flutter.

250

Ric.  Whither am I fallen? into hell!

252

Ubald.                            Who makes that noise, there?

254

Help me, if thou art a friend.

256

Ric.                                     A friend! I am where

I cannot help myself; let me see thy face.

258

Ubald.  How, Ricardo! Prithee, throw me

260

Thy cloak, if thou canst, to cover me; I am almost

Frozen to death.

262

Ric.                 My cloak! I have no breeches;

264

I am in my shirt, as thou art; and here's nothing

For myself but a clown's cast suit.

266

Ubald.                                         We are both undone.

268

Prithee, roar a little − Madam!

270

Re-enter Hilario below, in Ricardo's suit.

272

Ric.                                       Lady of the house!

274

Ubald.  Grooms of the chamber!

276

Ric.                                        Gentlewomen! Milkmaids!

278

Ubald.  Shall we be murdered?

280

Soph.                                   No, but soundly punished,

To your deserts.

282

Ric.                  You are not in earnest, madam?

284

Soph.  Judge as you find, and feel it; and now hear

286

What I irrevocably purpose to you.

Being received as guests into my house,

288

And with all it afforded entertained,

You have forgot all hospitable duties;

290

And, with the defamation of my lord,

Wrought on my woman weakness, in revenge

292

Of his injuries, as you fashioned them to me,

To yield my honour to your lawless lust.

294

Hil.  Mark that, poor fellows.

296

Soph.                                   And so far you have

298

Transgressed against the dignity of men,

Who should, bound to it by virtue, still defend

300

Chaste ladies' honours, that it was your trade

To make them infamous: but you are caught

302

In your own toils, like lustful beasts, and therefore

Hope not to find the usage of men from me:

304

Such mercy you have forfeited, and shall suffer

Like the most slavish women.

306

Ubald.                                   How will you use us?

308

Soph.  Ease, and excess in feeding, made you wanton.

310

A pleurisy of ill blood you must let out,

By labour, and spare diet that way got too,

312

Or perish for hunger. − Reach him up that distaff

With the flax upon it; − though no Omphale,

314

Nor you a second Hercules, as I take it,

As you spin well at my command, and please me,

316

Your wages, in the coarsest bread and water,

Shall be proportionable.

318

Ubald.                           I will starve first.

320

Soph.  That's as you please.

322

Ric.                               What will become of me now?

324

Soph. You shall have gentler work; I have oft observed

326

You were proud to shew the fineness of your hands,

And softness of your fingers; you should reel well

328

What he spins, if you give your mind to it, as I'll force you. −

Deliver him his materials. − Now you know

330

Your penance, fall to work; hunger will teach you:

And so, as slaves to your lust, not me, I leave you.

332

[Exeunt Sophia and Corisca.]

334

Ubald.  I shall spin a fine thread out now!

336

Ric.                                                          I cannot look

338

On these devices, but they put me in mind

Of rope-makers.

340

Hil.                   Fellow, think of thy task.

342

Forget such vanities; my livery there,

Will serve thee to work in.

344

Ric.                                 Let me have my clothes yet;

346

I was bountiful to thee.

348

Hil.                             They are past your wearing,

And mine by promise, as all these can witness.

350

You have no holidays coming, nor will I work

While these and this lasts; and so when you please

352

You may shut up your shop windows.

354

[Exit Hilario.]

356

Ubald.                                              I am faint,

And must lie down.

358

Ric.                        I am hungry too, and cold.

360

O cursèd women!

362

Ubald.                This comes of our whoring.

But let us rest as well as we can to-night,

364

But not o'ersleep ourselves, lest we fast tomorrow.

366

[Exeunt.]

ACT IV, SCENE III.

Alba Regalis, Hungary.

A Room in the Palace.

Enter Ladislaus, Honoria, Eubulus, Ferdinand,

Acanthe, and Attendants.

1

Hon.  Now you know all, sir, with the motives why

2

I forced him to my lodging.

4

Ladis.                                 I desire

No more such trials, lady.

6

Hon.                                I presume, sir,

8

You do not doubt my chastity.

10

Ladis.                                     I would not;

But these are strange inducements.

12

Eubu.                                            By no means, sir.

14

Why, though he were with violence seized upon,

And still detained, the man, sir, being no soldier,

16

Nor used to charge his pike when the breach is open,

There was no danger in't! You must conceive, sir,

18

Being religious, she chose him for a chaplain,

To read old homilies to her in the dark;

20

She's bound to it by her canons.

22

Ladis.                                       Still tormented

With thy impertinence!

24

Hon.                           By yourself, dear sir,

26

I was ambitious only to o'erthrow

His boasted constancy in his consent;

28

But for fact I contemn him: I was never

Unchaste in thought; I laboured to give proof

30

What power dwells in this beauty you admire so;

And when you see how soon it hath transformed him,

32

And with what superstition he adores it,

Determine as you please.

34

Ladis.                              I will look on

36

This pageant, but −

38

Hon.                 When you have seen and heard, sir,

The passages which I myself discovered,

40

And could have kept concealed, had I meant basely,

Judge as you please.

42

Ladis.                    Well, I'll observe the issue.

44

Eubu.  How had you ta'en this, general, in your wife?

46

Ferd.  As a strange curiosity; but queens

48

Are privileged above subjects, and 'tis fit, sir.

50

[Exeunt.]

ACT IV, SCENE IV.

Another Room in the same.

Enter Mathias and Baptista.

1

Bapt.  You are much altered, sir, since the last night,

2

When the queen left you, and look cheerfully,

Your dulness quite blown over.

4

Math.                                       I have seen a vision

6

This morning makes it good; and never was

In such security as at this instant,

8

Fall what can fall: and when the queen appears,

Whose shortest absence now is tedious to me,

10

Observe the encounter.

12

Enter Honoria: Ladislaus, Eubulus, Ferdinand,

and Acanthe, with others, appear above.

14

Bapt.                         She already is

16

Entered the lists.

18

Math.              And I prepared to meet her.

20

Bapt.  I know my duty.

22

[Going.]

24

Hon.                         Not so, you may stay now,

As a witness of our contract.

26

Bapt.                                   I obey

28

In all things, madam.

30

Hon.                      Where's that reverence,

Or rather superstitious adoration,

32

Which, captive-like to my triumphant beauty

You paid last night? No humble knee, nor sign

34

Of vassal duty! sure this is the foot

To whose proud cover, and then happy in it,

36

Your lips were glued; and that the neck then offered,

To witness your subjection, to be trod on:

38

Your certain loss of life in the king's anger

Was then too mean a price to buy my favour;

40

And that false glow-worm fire of constancy

To your wife, extinguished by a greater light

42

Shot from our eyes − and that, it may be, (being

Too glorious to be looked on,) hath deprived you

44

Of speech and motion: but I will take off

A little from the splendour, and descend

46

From my own height, and in your lowness hear you

Plead as a suppliant.

48

Math.                     I do remember

50

I once saw such a woman.

52

Hon.                                How!

54

Math.                                     And then

She did appear a most magnificent queen,

56

And what's more, virtuóus, though somewhat darkened

With pride, and self-opinion.

58

Eubu.                                   Call you this courtship?

60

Math.  And she was happy in a royal husband,

62

Whom envy could not tax unless it were

For his too much indulgence to her humours.

64

Eubu.  Pray you, sir, observe that touch, 'tis to the purpose;

66

I like the play the better for't.

68

Math.                                   And she lived

Worthy her birth and fortune: you retain yet

70

Some part of her angelical form; but when

Envy to the beauty of another woman,

72

Inferior to hers, one that she never

Had seen, but in her picture, had dispersed

74

Infection through her veins, and loyalty,

Which a great queen, as she was, should have nourished,

76

Grew odious to her −

78

Hon.                      I am thunderstruck.

80

Math. And lust in all the bravery it could borrow

From majesty, howe'er disguised, had ta'en

82

Sure footing in the kingdom of her heart,

The throne of chastity once, how, in a moment,

84

All that was gracious, great, and glorious in her,

And won upon all hearts, like seeming shadows

86

Wanting true substance, vanished!

88

Hon.                                             How his reasons

Work on my soul!

90

Math.                 Retire into yourself;

92

Your own strengths, madam, strongly manned with virtue,

And be but as you were, and there's no office

94

So base, beneath the slavery that men

Impose on beasts, but I will gladly bow to.

96

But as you play and juggle with a stranger,

Varying your shapes like Thetis, though the beauties

98

Of all that are by poets' raptures sainted

Were now in you united, you should pass

100

Pitied by me, perhaps, but not regarded.

102

Eubu.  If this take not, I am cheated.

104

Math.                                              To slip once

Is incident, and excused by human frailty;

106

But to fall ever, damnable. We were both

Guilty, I grant, in tendering our affection;

108

But, as I hope you will do, I repented.

When we are grown up to ripeness, our life is

110

Like to this [magic] picture. While we run

A constant race in goodness, it retains

112

The just proportion; but the journey being

Tedious, and sweet temptation in the way,

114

That may in some degree divert us from

The road that we put forth in, ere we end

116

Our pilgrimage, it may, like this, turn yellow,

Or be with blackness clouded: but when we

118

Find we have gone astray, and labour to

Return unto our never-failing guide,

120

Virtue, contrition, with unfeignèd tears,

The spots of vice washed off, will soon restore it

122

To the first pureness.

124

Hon.                        I am disenchanted:

Mercy, O mercy, heavens!

126

[Kneels.]

128

Ladis.                              I am ravished

130

With what I have seen and heard.

132

Ferd.                                            Let us descend,

And hear the rest below.

134

Eubu.                           This hath fallen out

136

Beyond my expectation.

138

[They descend.]

140

Hon.                            How have I wandered

Out of the track of piety! and misled

142

By overweening pride, and flattery

Of fawning sycophants, (the bane of greatness,)

144

Could never meet till now a passenger,

That in his charity would set me right,

146

Or stay me in my precipice to ruin.

How ill have I returned your goodness to me!

148

The horror, in my thought of’t, turns me marble:

But if it may be yet prevented −

150

Re-enter Ladislaus, Eubulus, Ferdinand,

152

Acanthe, and others, below.

154

                                               O sir,

What can I do to shew my sorrow, or

156

With what brow ask your pardon?

158

Ladis.                                          Pray you, rise.

160

Hon.  Never, till you forgive me, and receive

Unto your love and favour a changed woman:

162

My state and pride turned to humility, henceforth

Shall wait on your commands, and my obedience

164

Steered only by your will.

166

Ladis.                             And that will prove

A second and a better marriage to me.

168

All is forgotten.

170

Hon.               Sir, I must not rise yet,

Till, with a free confession of a crime

172

Unknown to you yet, and a following suit,

Which thus I beg, be granted.

174

Ladis.                                     I melt with you:

176

'Tis pardoned, and confirmed thus.

178

[Raises her.]

180

Hon.                                              Know then, sir,

In malice to this good knight's wife, I practised

182

Ubaldo and Ricardo to corrupt her.

184

Bapt.  [Aside]

Thence grew the change of the picture.

186

Hon.                                                   And how far

188

They have prevailed, I am ignorant: now, if you, sir,

For the honour of this good man, may be entreated

190

To travaile thither, it being but a day's journey,

To fetch them off −

192

Ladis.                 We will put on to-night.

194

Bapt.  I, if you please, your harbinger.

196

Ladis.                                                I thank you. −

198

Let me embrace you in my arms; your service

Done on the Turk, compared with this, weighs nothing.

200

Math.  I am still your humble creature.

202

Ladis.                                                  My true friend.

204

Ferd.  And so you are bound to hold him.

206

Eubu.                                                      Such a plant

208

Imported to your kingdom, and here grafted,

Would yield more fruit than all the idle weeds

210

That suck up your rain of favour.

212

Ladis.                                          In my will

I’ll not be wanting. Prepare for our journey.

214

In act be my Honoria now, not name,

And to all aftertimes preserve thy fame.

216

[Exeunt.]

ACT V.

SCENE I.

Bohemia.

A Hall in Mathias’ House.

Enter Sophia, Corisca, and Hilario.

1

Soph.  Are they then so humble?

2

Hil.                                      Hunger and hard labour

4

Have tamed them, madam; at the first they bellowed

Like stags ta'en in a toil, and would not work

6

For sullenness; but when they found, without it

There was no eating, and that to starve to death

8

Was much against their stomach; by degrees,

Against their wills, they fell to it.

10

Coris.                                        And now feed on

12

The little pittance you allow, with gladness.

14

Hil.  I do remember that they stopped their noses

At the sight of beef and mutton, as coarse feeding

16

For their fine palates; but now, their work being ended,

They leap at a barley crust, and hold cheese-parings,

18

With a spoonful of palled wine poured in their water,

For festival-exceedings.

20

Coris.                         When I examine

22

My spinster's work, he trembles like a prentice,

And takes a box on the ear, when I spy faults

24

And botches in his labour, as a favour

From a curst mistress.

26

Hil.                           The other, too, reels well

28

For his time; and if your ladyship would please

To see them for your sport, since they want airing,

30

It would do well, in my judgment; you shall hear

Such a hungry dialogue from them!

32

Soph.                                              But suppose,

34

When they are out of prison, they should grow

Rebellious?

36

Hil.          Never fear't; I'll undertake

38

To lead them out by the nose with a coarse thread

Of the one's spinning, and make the other reel after,

40

And without grumbling; and when you are weary of

Their company, as easily return them.

42

Coris.  Dear madam, it will help to drive away

44

Your melancholy.

46

Soph.                 Well, on this assurance,

I am content; bring them hither.

48

Hil.                                            I will do it

50

In stately equipage.

52

[Exit Hilario.]

54

Soph.                  They have confessed, then,

They were set on by the queen, to taint me in

56

My loyalty to my lord?

58

Coris.                         'Twas the main cause,

That brought them hither.

60

Soph.                               I am glad I know it;

62

And as I have begun, before I end

I'll at the height revenge it; let us step aside,

64

They come: the object's so ridiculous,

In spite of my sad thoughts, I cannot but

66

Lend a forced smile to grace it.

68

Re-enter Hilario, with Ubaldo spinning,

and Ricardo reeling.

70

Hil.                                           Come away:

72

Work as you go, and lose no time, 'tis precious;

You'll find it in your commons.

74

Ric.                                           Commons, call you it!

76

The word is proper; I have grazed so long

Upon your commons, I am almost starved here.

78

Hil.  Work harder, and they shall be bettered.

80

Ubald.                                                         Bettered!

82

Worser they cannot be: would I might lie

Like a dog under her table, and serve for a footstool,

84

So I might have my belly full of that

Her Iceland cur refuses!

86

Hil.                              How do you like

88

Your airing? is it not a favour?

90

Ric.                                          Yes;

Just such a one as you use to a brace of greyhounds,

92

When they are led out of their kennels to scumber;

But our case is ten times harder, we have nothing

94

In our bellies to be vented: if you will be

An honest yeoman-fewterer, feed us first,

96

And walk us after.

98

Hil.                      Yeoman-fewterer!

Such another word to your governor, and you go

100

Supperless to bed for't.

102

Ubald.                        Nay, even as you please;

The comfortable names of breakfasts, dinners,

104

Collations, supper, beverage, are words

Worn out of our remembrance.

106

Ric.                                          O for the steam

108

Of meat in a cook's shop!

110

Ubald.                             I am so dry

I have not spittle enough to wet my fingers

112

When I draw my flax from my distaff.

114

Ric.                                                     Nor I strength

To raise my hand to the top of my reeler . Oh!

116

I have the cramp all over me.

118

Hil.                                     What do you think

Were best to apply to it? A cramp-stone, as I take it,

120

Were very useful.

122

Ric.                    Oh! no more of stones,

We have been used too long like hawks already.

124

Ubald.  We are not so high in our flesh now to need casting,

126

We will come to an empty fist.

128

Hil.                                          Nay, that you shall not.

So ho, birds! −

130

[Holds up a piece of bread.]

132

               − How the eyasses scratch and scramble!

134

Take heed of a surfeit, do not cast your gorges;

This is more than I have commission for; be thankful.

136

Soph.  Were all that study the abuse of women

138

Used thus, the city would not swarm with cuckolds,

Nor so many tradesmen break.

140

Coris.                                    Pray you, appear now,

142

And mark the alteration.

144

[Sophia comes forward.]

146

Hil.                               To your work,

My lady is in presence; shew your duties:

148

Exceeding well.

150

Soph.               How do your scholars profit?

152

Hil.  Hold up your heads demurely. Prettily,

For young beginners.

154

Coris.                      And will do well in time,

156

If they be kept in awe.

158

Ric.                             In awe! I am sure

I quake like an aspen leaf.

160

Ubald.                             No mercy, lady?

162

Ric.  Nor intermission?

164

Soph.                          Let me see your work:

166

Fie upon't, what a thread's here! a poor cobbler's wife

Would make a finer to sew a clown's rent startup;

168

And here you reel as you were drunk.

170

Ric.                                                     I am sure

It is not with wine.

172

Soph.                   O, take heed of wine;

174

Cold water is far better for your healths,

Of which I am very tender: you had foul bodies,

176

And must continue in this physical diet,

Till the cause of your disease be ta'en away,

178

For fear of a relapse; and that is dangerous:

Yet I hope already that you are in some

180

Degree recovered, and that way to resolve me,

Answer me truly; nay, what I propound

182

Concerns both; nearer: what would you now give,

If your means were in your hands, to lie all night

184

With a fresh and handsome lady?

186

Ubald.                                       How! a lady?

O, I am past it; hunger with her razor

188

Hath made me an eunuch.

190

Ric.                                  For a mess of porridge,

Well sopped with a bunch of radish and a carrot,

192

I would sell my barony; but for women, oh!

No more of women; not a doit for a doxy,

194

After this hungry voyage.

196

Soph.                               These are truly

Good symptoms; let them not venture too much in the air,

198

Till they are weaker.

200

Ric.                       This is tyranny.

202

Ubald.  Scorn upon scorn.

204

Soph.                              You were so

in your malicióus intents to me,

206

Enter a Servant.

208

And therefore 'tis but justice − What's the business?

210

Serv.  My lord's great friend, signior Baptista, madam,

212

Is newly lighted from his horse, with certain

Assurance of my lord's arrival.

214

Soph.                                      How?

216

And stand I trifling here? Hence with the mongrels

To their several kennels; there let them howl in private;

218

I'll be no further troubled.

220

[Exeunt Sophia and Servant.]

222

Ubald.                            O that ever

I saw this fury!

224

Ric.                Or looked on a woman

226

But as a prodigy in nature.

228

Hil.                                  Silence;

No more of this.

230

Coris.             Methinks you have no cause

232

To repent your being here.

234

Hil.                                  Have you not learnt,

When your states are spent, your several trades to live by,

236

And never charge the hospital?

238

Coris.                                     Work but tightly,

And we will not use a dish-clout in the house,

240

But of your spinning.

242

Ubald.                     O, I would this hemp

Were turned to a halter!

244

Hil.                             Will you march?

246

Ric.                                                      A soft one,

248

Good general, I beseech you.

250

Ubald.                                   I can hardly

Draw my legs after me.

252

Hil.                             For a crouch, you may use

254

Your distaff; a good wit makes use of all things.

256

[Exeunt.]

ACT V, SCENE II.

A Room in the same.

Enter Sophia and Baptista.

1

Soph.  Was he jealous of me?

2

Bapt.                                   There's no perfit love

4

Without some touch of’t, madam.

6

Soph.                                          And my picture,

Made by your devilish art, a spy upon

8

My actiöns! I ne'er sat to be drawn,

Nor had you, sir, commission for't.

10

Bapt.                                             Excuse me;

12

At his earnest suit I did it.

14

Soph.                              Very good: −

Was I grown so cheap in his opinion of me?

16

Bapt.  The prosperous events that crown his fortunes

18

May qualify the offence.

20

Soph.                             Good, the events: −

The sanctuary fools and madmen fly to,

22

When their rash and desperate undertakings thrive well:

But good and wise men are directed by

24

Grave counsels, and with such deliberation

Proceed in their affairs, that chance has nothing

26

To do with them: howsoe'er, take the pains, sir,

To meet the honour (in the king and queen's

28

Approaches to my house) that breaks upon me;

I will expect them with my best of care.

30

Bapt.  To entertain such royal guests −

32

Soph.                                                I know it;

34

Leave that to me, sir.

36

[Exit Baptista.]

38

                              What should move the queen,

So given to ease and pleasure, as fame speaks her,

40

To such a journey! or work on my lord

To doubt my loyalty, nay, more, to take,

42

For the resolution of his fears, a course

That is by holy writ denied a Christian?

44

'Twas impious in him, and perhaps the welcome

He hopes in my embraces, may deceive

46

[Trumpets sounded.]

48

His expectatiön. The trumpets speak

50

The king's arrival: − help a woman's wit now,

To make him know his fault, and my just anger!

52

[Exit Sophia.]

ACT V, SCENE III.

A Hall in the Same.

A Flourish. Enter Ladislaus, Ferdinand,

Eubulus, Mathias, Baptista, Honoria,

and Acanthe, with Attendants.

1

Eubu.  Your majesty must be weary.

2

Hon.                                               No, my lord,

4

A willing mind makes a hard journey easy.

6

Math.  Not Jove, attended on by Hermes, was

More welcome to the cottage of Philemon

8

And his poor Baucis, than your gracious self,

Your matchless queen, and all your royal train,

10

Are to your servant and his wife.

12

Ladis.                                        Where is she?

14

Hon.  I long to see her as my now-loved rival.

16

Eubu.  And I to have a smack at her; 'tis a cordial

To an old man, better than sack and a toast

18

Before he goes to supper.

20

Math.                              Ha! is my house turned

To a wilderness? Nor wife nor servants ready,

22

With all rites due to majesty, to receive

Such unexpected blessings! − You assured me

24

Of better preparatiön; hath not

The excess of joy transported her beyond

26

Her understanding?

28

Bapt.                     I now parted from her,

And gave her your directions.

30

Math.                                    How shall I beg

32

Your majesties' patience! sure my family's drunk,

Or by some witch, in envy of my glory,

34

A dead sleep thrown upon them.

36

Enter Hilario and Servants.

38

Serv.                                          Sir.

40

Math.                                              But that

The sacred presence of the king forbids it,

42

My sword should make a massacre among you.

Where is your mistress?

44

Hil.                             First, you are welcome home, sir:

46

Then know, she says she's sick, sir. −

                                          [Aside] There's no notice

48

Taken of my bravery!

50

Math.                       Sick at such a time!

It cannot be: though she were on her death-bed,

52

And her spirit e'en now departed, here stand they

Could call it back again, and in this honour,

54

Give her a second being. Bring me to her;

I know not what to urge, or how to redeem

56

This mortgage of her manners.

58

[Exeunt Mathias, Hilario, and Servants.]

60

Eubu.                                      There's no climate

On the world, I think, where one jade's trick or other

62

Reigns not in women.

64

Ferd.                         You were ever bitter

Against the sex.

66

Ladis.              This is very strange.

68

Hon.                                              Mean women

70

Have their faults, as well as queens.

72

Ladis.                                         O, she appears now.

74

Re-enter Mathias with Sophia;

Hilario following.

76

Math.  The injury that you conceive I have done you

78

Dispute hereafter, and in your perverseness

Wrong not yourself and me.

80

Soph.                                   I am past my childhood,

82

And need no tutor.

84

Math.                  This is the great king,

To whom I am engaged till death for all

86

I stand possessed of.

88

Soph.                     My humble roof is proud, sir,

To be the canopy of so much greatness

90

Set off with goodness.

92

Ladis.                       My own praises flying

In such pure air as your sweet breath, fair lady,

94

Cannot but please me.

96

Math.                        This is the queen of queens,

In her magnificence to me.

98

Soph.                                 In my duty

100

I kiss her highness' robe.

102

Hon.                               You stoop too low

To her whose lips would meet with yours.

104

[Kisses her.]

106

Soph.                                                        Howe'er

108

It may appear preposterous in women

So to encounter, 'tis your pleasure, madam,

110

And not my proud ambition. –

            [Aside to Mathias] Do you hear, sir?

112

Without a magical picture, in the touch

I find your print of close and wanton kisses

114

On the queen's lips.

116

Math.                   Upon your life be silent:

And now salute these lords.

118

Soph.                                 Since you will have me,

120

You shall see I am experienced at the game,

And can play it tightly.

122

       [To Ferdinand] You are a brave man, sir,

And do deserve a free and hearty welcome:

124

Be this the prologue to it.

126

[Kisses him.]

128

Eubu.                            An old man's turn

Is ever last in kissing. − I have lips too,

130

However cold ones, madam.

132

Soph.                                   I will warm them

With the fire of mine.

134

[Kisses him.]

136

Eubu.                        And so she has! I thank you,

138

I shall sleep the better all night for't.

140

Math.  [Aside to Sophia]                 You express

The boldness of a wanton courtezan,

142

And not a matron's modesty; take up,

Or you are disgraced for ever.

144

Soph.                                    How? with kissing

146

Feelingly, as you taught me? would you have me

Turn my cheek to them, as proud ladies use

148

To their inferiors, as if they intended

Some business should be whispered in their ear,

150

And not a salutation? what I do,

I will do freely; now I am in the humour,

152

I'll fly at all: are there any more?

154

Math.                                         Forbear,

Or you will raise my anger to a height

156

That will descend in fury.

158

Soph.                             Why? you know

How to resolve yourself what my intents are,

160

By the help of Mephostophilus, and your picture:

Pray you, look upon't again. I humbly thank

162

The queen's great care of me while you were absent.

She knew how tedious 'twas for a young wife,

164

And being for that time a kind of widow,

To pass away her melancholy hours

166

Without good company, and in charity, therefore,

Provided for me: out of her own store,

168

She culled the lords Ubaldo and Ricardo,

Two principal courtiers for ladies' service,

170

To do me all good offices; and as such

Employed by her, I hope I have received

172

And entertained them; nor shall they depart

Without the effect arising from the cause

174

That brought them hither.

176

Math.                             Thou dost belie thyself:

I know that in my absence thou wert honest,

178

However now turned monster.

180

Soph.                                      The truth is,

We did not deal, like you, in speculations

182

On cheating pictures; we knew shadows were

No substances, and actual performance

184

The best assurance. I will bring them hither,

To make good in this presence so much for me.

186

Some minutes space I beg your majesties' pardon. −

You are moved now: champ upon this bit a little,

188

Anon you shall have another. − Wait me, Hilario.

190

[Exeunt Sophia and Hilario.]

192

Ladis.  How now? turned statue, sir!

194

Math.                                            Fly, and fly quickly,

From this cursed habitation, or this Gorgon

196

Will make you all as I am. In her tongue

Millions of adders hiss, and every hair

198

Upon her wicked head a snake more dreadful

Than that Tisiphone threw on Athamas,

200

Which in his madness forced him to dismember

His proper issue. O that ever I

202

Reposed my trust in magic, or believed

Impossibilities! or that charms had power

204

To sink and search into the bottomless hell

Of a false woman's heart!

206

Eubu.                             These are the fruits

208

Of marriage! an old bachelor as I am,

And, what's more, will continue so, is not troubled

210

With these fine fagaries.

212

Ferd.                            Till you are resolved, sir,

Forsake not hope.

214

Bapt.                  Upon my life, this is

216

Dissimulation.

218

Ladis.          And it suits not with

Your fortitude and wisdom to be thus

220

Transported with your passion.

222

Hon.                                        You were once

Deceived in me, sir, as I was in you;

224

Yet the deceit pleased both.

226

Math.                               She hath confessed all;

What further proof should I ask?

228

Hon.                                           Yet remember

230

The distance that is interposed between

A woman's tongue and her heart; and you must grant,

232

You build upon no certainties.

234

Re-enter Sophia, Corisca, and Hilario,

with Ubaldo and Ricardo in rags,

236

spinning and reeling, as before.

238

Eubu.                                    What have we here?

240

Soph.  You must come on, and shew yourselves.

242

Ubald.                                                         The king!

244

Ric.  And queen too! would I were as far under the earth

As I am above it!

246

Ubald.              Some poet will,

248

From this relation, or in verse or prose,

Or both together blended, render us

250

Ridiculous to all ages.

252

Ladis.                        I remember

This face, when it was in a better plight:

254

Are not you Ricardo?

256

Hon.                        And this thing, I take it,

Was once Ubaldo.

258

Ubald.                 I am now I know not what.

260

Ric.  We thank your majesty for employing us

262

To this subtle Circe.

264

Eubu.                     How, my lord! turned spinster!

Do you work by the day, or by the great?

266

Ferd.                                                 Is your theorbo

268

Turned to a distaff, signior? and your voice,

With which you chanted, Room for a lusty gallant!

270

Tuned to the note of Lachrymae?

272

Eubu.                                         Prithee tell me,

For I know thou'rt free, how oft, and to the purpose,

274

You've been merry with this lady.

276

Ric.                                              Never, never.

278

Ladis.  Howsoever, you should say so for your credit,

Being the only court-bull.

280

Ubald.                            O, that ever

282

I saw this kicking heifer!

284

Soph.                            You see, madam,

How I have cured your servants, and what favours

286

They with their rampant valour have won from me.

You may, as they are physic’d, I presume,

288

Trust a fair virgin with them; they have learned

Their several trades to live by, and paid nothing

290

But cold and hunger for them: and may now

Set up for themselves, for here I give them over. −

292

And now to you, sir; why do you not again

Peruse your picture, and take the advice

294

Of your learnèd consort? these are the men, or none,

That made you, as the Italian says, a becco.

296

Math.  I know not which way to entreat your pardon,

298

Nor am I worthy of it. My Sophia,

My best Sophia; here before the king,

300

The queen, these lords, and all the lookers on,

I do renounce my error, and embrace you,

302

As the great example to all aftertimes,

For such as would die chaste and noble wives,

304

With reverence to imitate.

306

Soph.                               Not so, sir;

I yet hold off. However I have purged

308

My doubted innocence, the foul aspersions,

In your unmanly doubts, cast on my honour,

310

Cannot so soon be washed off.

312

Eubu.                                      Shall we have

More jiggobobs yet?

314

Soph.                     When you went to the wars,

316

I set no spy upon you, to observe

Which way you wandered, though our sex by nature

318

Is subject to suspiciöns and fears;

My confidence in your loyalty freed me from them.

320

But, to deal as you did, 'gainst your religion,

With this enchanter, to survey my actions,

322

Was more than woman's weakness; therefore know,

And 'tis my boon unto the king, I do

324

Desire a separation from your bed;

For I will spend the remnant of my life

326

In prayer and meditation.

328

Math.                            O take pity

Upon my weak condition, or I am

330

More wretched in your innocence, than if

I had found you guilty. Have you shown a jewel

332

Out of the cabinet of your rich mind,

To lock it up again? − She turns away.

334

Will none speak for me? shame and sin hath robbed me

Of the use of my tongue.

336

Ladis.                      Since you have conquered, madam,

338

You wrong the glory of your victory,

If you use it not with mercy.

340

Ferd.                                  Any penance

342

You please to impose upon him, I dare warrant

He will gladly suffer.

344

Eubu.                      Have I lived to see

346

But one good woman, and shall we for a trifle,

Have her turn nun? I will first pull down the cloister.

348

To the old sport again, with a good luck to you!

‘Tis not alone enough that you are good,

350

We must have some of the breed of you: will you destroy

The kind and race of goodness? I am converted,

352

And ask your pardon, madam, for my ill opinion

Against the sex; and shew me but two such more,

354

I'll marry yet, and love them.

356

Hon.                                    She that yet

Ne'er knew what 'twas to bend but to the king,

358

Thus begs remission for him.

360

Soph.                                   O, dear madam,

Wrong not your greatness so.

362

Omnes.                                We are all suitors.

364

Ubald.  I do deserve to be hard among the rest.

366

Ric.  And we have suffered for it.

368

Soph.                                          I perceive

370

There's no resistance: but, suppose I pardon

What's past, who can secure me he'll be free

372

From jealousy hereafter?

374

Math.                            I will be

My own security: go, ride, where you please;

376

Feast, revel, banquet, and make choice with whom,

I'll set no watch upon you; and, for proof of it,

378

This cursèd picture I surrender up

To a consuming fire.

380

Bapt.                      As I abjure

382

The practice of my art.

384

Soph.                         Upon these terms

I am reconciled; and for these that have paid

386

The price of their folly, I desire your mercy.

388

Ladis.  At your request they have it.

390

Ubald.                                        Hang all trades now!

392

Ric.  I will find a new one, and that is, to live honest.

394

Hil.  These are my fees.

396

Ubald.                Pray you, take them, with a mischief!

398

Ladis.  So, all ends in peace now.

And, to all married men, be this a caution,

400

Which they should duly tender as their life,

Neither to dote too much, nor doubt a wife.

402

[Exeunt Omnes.]
