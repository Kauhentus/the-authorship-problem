Prologue.
THus from the Poet am I bid to say,
He knowes what Iudges sit to doome each Play,
(The over-curious Criticke, or the wise)
The one with squint, t'other with sunne-like eyes,
Shootes through each Scaene: the one cryas all things downe,
T'other hides strangers faults close as his owne.
Las! Those who out of custome come to geere,
(S•ng the full quire of the nine Muses here)
So carping, not from wit, but apish spite,
And fetherdignorance, thus our Poet does slight.
T'is not a gay sute, or distorted face,
Can beate his merit off, which has wonne grace
In the full Theater, nor can now feare
The teeth of any snakie whisperer:
But to the white, and sweet unclouded brow,
(The heaven where true worth moves) our Poet does bow;
Patrons of Arts, and Pilots to the Stage,
Who guide it (through all tempests) from the rage
Of envious whirle windes. O doe you but steere
His Muse this day, and bring her tot'h wish'd shore,
You are those Delphicke powers, whom shee'le adore.

ALL'S LOST BY LVST.
Actus Primus.
Enter Rodericke, King of Spaine, Lothario, Medina, Iulianus, Antonio, and Lazarello.
Rodericke.
GIve leave: Lothario.
Afide Lords.
Lo.
My Soveraigne.
Rod.
The newes in briefe: how replyes Iacinta?
Will she be woman? will shee meete our Armes
With an alternate roundure? will she doe?
Lo.
Nothing to the purpose my Liege, cold as Aquarius,
There she was borne, and there she still remaines;
I cannot move her to enter into Pisces, I
Laid the flesh to her too, and the delights thereof, she leanes
Another way, and talkes all of the spirit, I
Frighted her with spirits too, but all would not doe:
description
Page [unnumbered]
She drew her knife, pointed it to her breast, swore
She would doe something, but womens tongues are
Sometimes longer then their armes.
Rod.
Enough, we have bethought another way.
This wooing application is too milde:
'Tis better trust the mercy of a storme.
To hast our way, then to be calmd for ever,
Short of the wished haven:
Now draw neere, you told us of a hot invasion▪
The barbarous and tawney Affricans,
Intend upon our confines.
Med.
True, my Liege.
Full threescore thousand are discryde in Armes,
Ready to passe the Streights of Gibbraltar,
Whose watry divisions, their Affricke bounds
〈…〉om our Christian Europe in Granado,
And Audalusia; they spred and flourish
Their silver moones, led as it is supposde,
By some blinde guide, some Saintish Infidell,
That prophesies subjection of our Spaine,
Vnto the Moores.
Rod.
They would deter us with their swarty lookes:
Were they the same to their similitude,
Sooty as the inhabitants of hell,
Whom they neerest figure; cold feare should flye
From us as distant as they are from beauty:
They come to sacrifice their blouds to us,
If that be red, a m•re rubrum,
Wee'le make so high to quench their silver moones;
And on their carkasses an Is•mus make
To passe their straytes agen, and forrage there.
Iul.
Your forward valour speakes you maiesticall,
But my dread Liege, does not your treasury
Grow thinne and empty? so long have you held
A champion resolution 'gainst the Turke▪
That Spaine is wasted in her noble strength,
On which presuming, tis to be supp〈…〉
The Moore is thus incourag'd.
description
Page [unnumbered]
Rod.
And yet we undaunted Iulianus, our treasury is
A myne unscarcht, wee have a Castle
Suppos'd inchanted, wee'le breake the magicke,
If spels there be, opethe forbidden dores
Which twenty of our predecessors have refus•e,
But added each a locke to guard it more,
Rather then our Souldiers shall want pay
To fight our battailes nobly.
Iul.
O my Lord, that's a dangerous secret, onely known
To such as can divine futurities,
And they with fearefull prophesies predict
Fatallevents to Spaine, when that shall be
Broke up by violence: till fate hath runne
Her owne wasting period; which out staide
Auspitiously they promise, that wreathes are kept
In the fore-dooming Court of destiny,
To binde us ever in a happy conquest.
Rod.
Tut. feare frights us not, nor shall hope foole us
If neede provoke, wee'le dig supply through hell
And her enchantments. Who c•n prefixe us
A time to see these incantations loosde?
Perhaps 'twill stay tenne generations more,
When our bloud royall may want succession,
If not; what bootes it us (lost in our dust
And memory 500. yeeres) that then this hidden
Worke shall be; tush, the weakenesse of our predecessors
Shall not fright us, all is not deadly,
That lookes dangerous.
Ant.
I wish no life to see that day.
Med.
Nor I, so many Kings have fear'd that destiny.
Rod.
Lord Iulianus, we commit to you
The charge of this great worke against the Moores,
With title of Lord Generall, as you please,
Order this high affaire; call to the field
An equall Army against those Affricans,
The bold and hardiest souldiers of our kingdome▪
Scourge backe agen th•se halfe-nak'• Infide•s
Into their sun-burnt Clymate; in thy heart
description
Page [unnumbered]
Be loyaltie and courage, strength in thine arme:
With christian vaiour strike the heathens dead,
And for thy triumph, bring the Mulyes head.
Iul.
This honour which your Maiestie has given me,
Tho better it might fit anothers wearing,
Of abler limbs, wheretime has not defac't,
Nor halfe so many winters quencht his bloud,
As a new spring it hath revivde ag••
This Autumne of my yeeres; there's but one care
I leave behinde me within the Court of Spaine,
My poore Iacinta, mine, and onely mine;
May she here thrive in honour, and in favours,
And I shall meete her with a victory,
(Heaven put before) as shall endow us both
In your high esteeme.
Rod.
That shall be our care noble Iulianus, to see her safe,
We love I•cinta more then you must know,
And for her sake we doe remove you hence;
You may thanke your daughter for this honour Sir,
If you knew our purpose.
Lo.
I understand all this, whilst he warres abroad, his
Daughter must skirmish at home; Venus is in conjunction
With Mercury, wit and lechery are both in labour
At once alas poore mayden-head, th'art cast i'faith,
And must to execution; virginity hadst thou bin
Moulded in my compasse, thou hadst scap't this pitfall.
Rod.
On, to thy charge, prosper in thy high deedes;
Who aymes at honour nobly, nobly speedes.
Iul.
My heart and tongue, thus sentence to my fate,
In honour thrive, in basenesse ruinate.
Rod.
All helpe him on his speede: Lothario.
Exeunt omnes nisi Rod. & Loth.
Have we not finely moulded our designe?
Times antient bawde, opportunity attends us now,
And yet our flaming bloud will scarce give leave
To opportunity.
Lo.
I told your highnesse of a second bawd to time, & yet
Not times second neither, for time nere pattern'd her
description
Page [unnumbered]
A thing reall, not a dumb morall, as time it selfe
Is, but a speaking thing, and one that speakes
Effectually; one that has wrackt more mayden-heads
In Spaine, then she has yeers upon her reverent browes,
And yet she writes odde of threescore, an odde wench 'tis.
Rod.
Thou nam'st her to me.
Lo.
Malena.
Rod.
And hast instructed her?
Lo.
I have prepar'd her fit for instruction my Liege; shee
Waites her further confirmation from your Highnesse:
Oh every souldier has a double heart, when the King's in field.
Rod.
Call her
Lo.
By her right name; bawd, where art thou bawd?
Rod.
If Words will serve, if not, by rapines force;
Wee'le plucke this apple from th'Hesperides.
Enter Malena.
Lo.
This is the thing I told your Highnesse of.
Rod.
A reverent one it is, & may be cal'd schoolemistresse of her sexe; if Apelles had ever picturde forth experience, here might he take his patterne.

Mal.
Indeed my Liege, I have bin the pattern that a great
Many has taken out pictures by, I confesse I have
Bin a greater friend to the Hospitals, then the Nunneries,
And I thinke it was the greater ch••ity, because
They are the poorer, and more wretched places.
Lo.
The very ipsissima of her sexe, my Liege, as old as
She is, I will undertake she shall wrastle a fall
With the strongest Virgin in Spaine, & throw her down too.
Rod.
Thou must be my Lawyer (I'le fee thee well,)
And at the Barre of beauty plead a cause,
Which whether right or wrong, must needs be mine.
Mal.
Indeed in rightfull causes, weake Lawyers will
Serve turne, but the wrong had need have
The best Orators; I'me but a weake vessell, you
Know my Liege.
Lo.
Shee'le hold out I warrant, harke you my Lieg,
description
Page [unnumbered]
This vessell is not hollow yet, it does not sound,
There's mettall in her, there's sacke in this Tunne,
That has eaten up a great deale of dead
Flesh in her time, lights, longs and bad livers.
Rod.
Come, come, you must not plead an insufficiency.
Mal
I'le doe my best my Lord.
Lo.
Tush, in malo consilio foeminae vincunt viros.
Mal.
Does he not abuse me my Liege?
Rod.
Not at all, he sayes women overcome men in
Giving counsell.
Mal.
Is there not a faulty word amongst them?
Lo.
Thou art able to corrupt any good sence, with bad construction:
I say foeminae vincunt, that is, quasi vincere cunctos,
Ouercomes all men.
Mal.
Go to, go to, there is a broad word amongst'm, vincunt
Quotha, is it spoke with a K, or a C? but in plaine
Language I will doe my best, if she be of my sexe, I
Will shew her the end of her function, men follow
The traditions of their forefathers, so should
Women follow the trades of their fore-mothers.
Rod.
I see thou hast perswasive oratory.
Here's iuyce of liquorish, good for thy voyce,
Speake freely, and effectually.
Mal.
I will speake the words that have o'rethrowne a
Hundred in my time.
Lo.
I was within compass then.
Mal.
Let me have accesse to her, if she be flesh & bloud,
I'le move her, I will not leave her till I turne her to a stone.
Rod.
Vnite your forces both, conquer in love,
I will reward as for a victory
Purchac't with bloud from my worst enemy:
Effect, for ill things have their effects we see
Prosper, wee'le call it a prosperity.
Exit.
Mal.
You'le bring me to the place and party?
Lo.
Prepar'd with all advantage. I will assist thee, thou
Destroyer of mayden-heads.
Exeunt.

Enter Antonio, and Lazarello.
Laz.
Your passions erre my Lord, did you foresee
What may ensue; folly begets danger,
Nay oft, their full effects, destruction;
You would not clothe the noblenesse of your bloud
In such base weedes, shee's a beggar you doate on.
Ant.
Th'ast spoke the worst thy malice can invent,
A beggar say'st? and better being so,
If a small Starre could overshine the Sunne,
And shew his brightnesse in the solsticie,
Should it be blam'd or prais'd? the feeble Vine
Brings forth sweet fruits, whilst the Cedars's barren;
Beggar is she, I'le poyse her graces with't,
And see how many infinites shee'le pull
The ballance downe, and yet that poverty
A goodnesse dis-esteem'd, shee's faire,
Modest, lovely, wise, vertuous.
Laz.
Nay, if you doate, I'le waste no more good counsell,
And what's her dower Sir?
Ant.
Infinites, I nam'd them to thee.
Laz.
O shee's faire, a faire dowry.
Ant.
Chast and vertuous.
Laz.
Those are iewels indeed, but they'le yeeld little.
Ant.
They are not things of prise, they are farre off,
And deare, yet Ladies send not for'em.
Laz.
May not a league be taken for a time?
Deferre this hasty match, you have employment
As a Souldier, the King has given you charge,
Approve your champion valour in the field,
If that remoue not this domesticke trouble,
Retire upon your Uenus.
Ant.
I'le prevent that venome,
This night I will be married to my sweet,
And then her memory enjoy'd, shall strengthen
Mine arme against my foe, which else would droope,
Suspecting of her losse, I feare it now;
description
Page [unnumbered]
What eye can looke upon her, but is captiv'd
In the inchanted prison of her eyes.
Laz.
Why you'le be jealous in your absence then?
Ant.
Away, away, thou dost forget her vertues
Faster then I can name 'em; shee's chastity
It selfe, and when a Shrine shall be set up
Vnto that Saint, it shall be built upon
The marble that shall cover her.
Enter Iulianus and Iacinta.
Laz.
Here comes the Generall.
Iul.
No more, no more, thy feares are all follies, my Iacinta
Iac.
I must not leave you thus.
Iul.
Antonio? what unplum'd? you are a Souldier Sir,
And Souldiers should be forward; looke yee
I have bright steele for the blacke Affricans;
I tell you Sir, I went not with more ioy
Vnto my mayden Bride, that Hymen night,
From whence I fetcht this iewell of my heart,
Then now I doe unto my second nuptials.
Oh 'tis a gallant Mistresse, an old man
Is young agen at sight of her.
Ant.
Worthy Sir, your leading vallor wil centuple the harts
Of all your followers; when set you forward?
Iul.
Tush, we limit time to her best haste,
Three dayes will be the most, the longer stay
Looses the more advantage.
Ant.
We shall be ready to attend your honour,
Hymen, this night I vow to thee, Mars be my
Morrowes Saint.
Laz.
Here were a Saint fitting your orisons.
Ant.
Blasphemy, speake that no more, the begger,
(If you will so prophane to speake her so)
Is gold refinde, compar'd unto this rubbish,
Diamond to Marble; my noble Lord
Wee'le leave you to hasten our attendance on you.
Exit Ant. & Lazar.

Iul.
Farewell Antonio,
I'me in haste too, my preparations call me.
Iac.
I call too, I beseech you heare me.
Iul.
Th'art a clog to me,
Me thinkes thou shouldst be reading o're new fashions,
Conferring with your Tire-woman for faire dressings,
Your Ieweller has new devices for yee,
Fine labels for your eares, bracelets for wrists,
Such as will illustrate your white hand;
These are all Pedlars ware to me, Iacinta;
I am for Corslets, Helmets, Bils, Bowes, and Pikes,
The thundring Guns, Trumpets tan tara,
The ratling sheepeskin, and the whistling Fife:
What Musicke's this to your eares? ha, farewell,
Farewell, and heaven blesse thee.
Iac.
Good heaven, how slightly
You o're-run my feares, you goe to meete
With a full power, an armed foe abroad,
And leave me single to an enemy
That hath both power and will to ruine me.
Iul.
'Tis treason that thou speak'st, and by the Saint
Of Spaine, mend it, or I'le discover thee:
Wrong my dread Liege, my King, my Soveraigne,
To say that he should doate upon your face,
Away, away, 'tis but your beauties pride,
So to belye it selfe thou art not faire,
Thou hast no eye to attract Maiestie,
To looke upon't; say he speake love to thee,
'Twas but to try thee, perhaps 'twas my consent,
Will you enquire the hidden hearts of Kings?
He would not wrong thee for his kingdomes wealth,
Even for my sake, away you wanton foole.
Iac.
There has bin ravishers, remember Tarquin.
Iul.
There has bin chast Ladies, remember Lucres:
I'le heare no more, my time and haste hath bard me,
My blessing take, heaven and that shall guard thee.
Exit.
Iac.
You leave me in a tempest, heaven guide my fate,
Oh let me sinke ere I be captivate.
Exit.

Enter Pedro, Iaques, and Claveele.
Ped.
I doe not like this match, this gay out-side
Is cloth of gold, within a ragged lining.
Iaq.
O poore comparison father, doe they use to line cloth of gold with cloth of gold; no, but with fine, gentle, and easie linings, and such my sister may be, for tho I say it that should not say it, my sister has a good face, a white necke, and a dainty hand, and that may serve for lining for the best cloth of gold in all Spaine.

Ped.
Cedars and shrubs cannot grow up together.
Iaq.
Away, away, speake not so like a Wood monger, I'le
Put you downe with a caparison now, doe we not use
To graft sweet apples upon crab-tree stocks, doe we
Not use to enoculate your Malicatoon upon a Gooseberry?
Such is my sisters case now, say that the noble man
Would enoculate his Lordship upon my sisters yeomandry,
What hurt were in this? would it grieve you to be a
Lords brother, or this old woman to have her Lady
Daughter to aske, Grauam, how doe you, will you ride
Abroad in your Croarch, or your embroderd side-saddle?
Cla.
I, thou talk'st wildly boy, yet err'st not much
In my conceit, be content man, and adde as meete it is,
Ioy to content, your daughter shal be made a happy woman
By a noble marriage.
Ped.
Happy say'st thou? oh 'tis as distant as the Moon from earth,
And has the like effects, it changes oft,
So with a silver brow, greatnesse lookes on us
Promising and lovely, but once growne full,
It brings swelling billowes to o'rewhelme us.
Iaq.
Pray father talk no more of the moon, but of your son,
Not my selfe that am your son and heire, but of your
Son in law that shall be, my noble L. Antonio, Lord of
Barcelona, and his noble Lady my sister, that shall be.
Ped.
'Twill well become her, what armes shall I give to make her gentle by?

Iaq.
Those we can buy of the Heraulds, you know shee
description

Has cryde Orenges the most of her time here in Ciuill,
Now a fine Orenge for her crest, with Ciuillity
Written round aboud it would speaks wondrous well,
Then a Capon in a Scutchen with a gizard
Vnder his left arme, with his spurs vpon his heeles
Riding vpon a Leman.
Ped.
Away, away
Thy talkes impertinent, what should a Capon
Do with a Leman?
Iaq.
I, you say well Father there indeed,
A Capon desires no Leman, and therefore
Wele hope of both that neither the Lord
Proue himselfe a Capon, nor my Sister a Leman.
Ped.
I, this thou touchest by a forced figure,
The perfect sence of all, thence grows my feare:
This loue was first 〈◊〉, and borne in lust
How long has he laid an vnlawfull leige
Against her Virgin honour, which had she yeelded,
And beene so lemond, she nere had bin profferd
The stile of wife.
Cla.
Peace, see they come.
Enter Ant. and Margaretta.
Iaq.
I marry, heres a Lady now will weare her owne haire.
Mar.
Nay now no further protestations,
You haue said enough to make me new, or ruine me,
And this my spirit, bids me prophesye
If you repent, as loue might be ore sated
In its best desires; and any croffe euent
Should fall upon this your unequall choise,
Yours is the crime, your handmaid must be blamelesse,
Since you haue sought what I haue not desirde,
And yet, you may avoide the fatall doome
(If any such there be) by throwing backe
Your atchieu'de vassayle.
Ant.
Teach me no errour.
I will not learne it, sweetest, if you do.

Whose sacred hands must guide vs to the path

Ant.
It shall be done in this acknowledgement.
Father and mother let me but call you so.
Iaq.
And brother eke also.
Ant.
Yes brother too,
By this I claime them all, your daughter makes
Me your sonne, and yours.
Iaq.
And my brother.
Ant.
Ile not forget that neither.
Iaq.
If you do, I will forget to call your Lady Sister.
Cla.
Sir, I haue question'd all the will in me,
And finde it now resolu'd vnto your wish.
Iaq.
You haue my good will too brother.
Ped.
Mine is wrought out through rocks of doubt and scare,
She is your owne, I send her pilots like
Into an Argosey beyond her sterage.
Ant.
Ile hand the helme with her, and there abide
Safetie, or drowning.
Ped.
She will be hated when the disdainfull browes
Of noble greatnesse shall be shot against her,
The scornes and flowts she shall endure, will be
Fa〈…〉 lesse content, then is the humble quiet she enioyes.
Ant.
All those I will rebuke, and if she blush,
The beauty then will check their painted cheekes
With a rebounding shame vpon themselues,
Let not more obstacles be mention'd,
Onely let priuacie protect vs yet
Altho we scant the full solemnitie
Due to thy wishes; Hymen which afterward.
Shall dare the largest blazon.

And then the smallest ceremony may serue.
All wants, are onely wanting vnto you
To giue your greatnesse the due ornaments.

O as a brother I will, I perceiue these great men
Are some what forgetfull of their poore kindred.

Aske for one Benedicke, my comends to him
Will bring him with thee, hees prepar'd for it.

Which you know will arise out of the two and twenty.

Tush, Ile treble that wages.

Nothing grieves me but this wedding will be so still borne
We shall haue no dancing at it, but Ile foot it
To the Priest howsoeuer, Fala, la, la, la:

How ere the kings employment in the wars
Calls on my person, I shall leaue behinde
My selfe in thee, and beare my selfe along
In thy sweet memory.

Why bawd, Ile tell thee what a bawd i•.

Then pander I will tell thee what a pander is.

A bawd• a thing that when the deuil plaies at 〈◊〉, bawd

The deuill playes on, and looses the bawd.

Mal.
Blesse ye faire Virgin:
Iac.
From your age with a virgine Epitaph, if you
No better be then I esteeme you.
Mal.
T were pity
Indeed you should be a virgin to my age
Sweet beauty, you woud be like a garment long laid by,
And out of fashion, which tho new, woud not be worth a wearing:
Iac.
Is that your companion
Parted with you?
Mal.
No companion Lady,
But a friend of mine, as I hope he is of yours.
Iac.
Y'are both naught then, and neither friends of mine.
But here you haue me prisoner in your power
If you haue ought to speake to me out with't.
Mal.
Ya're belou'd Lady, and which is more,
Yea most,
Of a king beloude.
Iac.
A good induction;
And all this I may deserue being a loyall subiect.
Mal.
Your loyalty may be mixt with his royalty,
If youle be rulde, vnderstand, kings are not common things,
Nor are their actions common; all things are
Proper, and peculiar vnto them, so Ladies
Whom they loue, are commonly proper Ladies, who being
Proper, cannot be counted common.

Now you come to me;
Tis true: For what is a virgin? knew you as much
As I youde nere be a virgin.
Iac.
I dare sweare I shoud not.
Mal.
A virgin? why tis as much as to say because
You were borne a childe you shoud euer be so;
This were ridiculous. Virginity,
Why tis a Iewell kept in a Casket,
Which neuer open'd, as good you neuer had it;
Shall muske be alwayes kept in the Cod, how shall
The sweetnesse be tasted then? Virginity is
Like a false friend to you, which indeed is better lost then kept,
Iac.

You will dishonour him.

Dogs worry you both; search slave in every angle,
Send pursuite after her, if thou returnst her not,
Thou shalt curse thy being.
Lo.
If she be not above steeples,
Nor beneath hell, I'le finde her, for so high
And low I can reach and dive, as heavy as I am.

Rod.
If she escape us, and once reach her father,
Now in his height of honour, we know not how
He may receive his wrongs, nor the event;
We will command him distant from the Court,
And his prisoners sent to us; And this shall ha••e
Before her possible speed, if she scape:
Wele threaten his heads losse, if he deny 'um,
Those that do wrong, had need keepe safety by 'um.

With such a linsie wolsie ornament.
Madam, is the mad dame, and thence mad woman:
Define it so and I will borrow still
That little of my store. A coat of tissue
If a foole weares it, is but a fooles coat.
Such are my trappings; oh for t•me thats gone,
Equality, oh sweet equality,
Borne under Libra, thou hast both right hands,
Without advantage, or priority.
Base ones made big by beauty are but slaves,
Their Lords nere truly bed but in their graves.
Hai a dangerous conceit, call my brother, Fid•lla.

Prethee be gone, and call him.
Am I despis'd so soone? wedlocke uniust,
Vnequall nuptials are not love, but lust:
Come backe past time, oh tis a fruitlesse call,
I may repent, but finde no helpe at all.
Now I forestall thee heaven ere I begin,
Forgive me, I must act some a heinous sinne,
I must now be changde.
Enter Clowne, and Fydella.
Clo. Ia.
Lady sister, did your Madamship
Send for my worship?
Mar.
I did send for you brother.
Iai
You may intreat me.
Mar.
I hope so, I have a letter
To my Lord (brother) containing so much love
And secresie; as I would trust none willingly
But your selfe for the delivery.
Ia.
A letter sister!
I would not have you to take me for a Carrier,
Or a Porter to carry words, or letters more
Then it pleases me; yet in the way of a Nuntius,
Partly Embassadour, or so, I will
Travell for your sake.
Mar.
Looke you, this is all, brother.
Ia.
Is this all sister?
Mar.
Vnlesse youle adde another:
Commends by word of mouth▪
Ia.
By word of mouth?
Twas not well spoken sister.
Mar.
Why brother?
Iay.
Why what words are there, but words of the mouth?
Except it be words of the tayle, which would sound but il•
In my Lord brothers cares: for words behinde
A mans backe are but winde, you know that.
description
Page [unnumbered]
Mar.
But be most carefull in the delivery, I entreat you brother;
You know our wedding is onely knowne to us,
A thing conceald from wide mouthd rumour, then should you
Find him in company with Nobles of his own rank.
Iaq.
Tush, I can smell the rankest of them all.
Mar.
Say amongst Ladies you shoud find him sporting
Dancing, kissing, or any such like wantonnesse,
Take heed your rude approach does not move him to any di•••ste.
Iaq.
O my nowne sister, my nose is a little more a kin to you
Now then ever it was; you woud have me be an informer
Of unlawfull games, as Ticktack, whipper ginny, in & in.
Mar.
No trust me brother, onely to instruct you I speak;
For the least disparagement should chance to him
His pleasure forbidding it, would be a death to me,
Iaq.
Well sister, heres my hand, and my heart is some where
Here about me too, but I'de be loath to bring him
Forth to witnesse, but I will be very carefull.
Mar.
You undo me else brother.
Iaq.
Pha, d'e thinke me for
A foole or your brother (sister)
Mar.
Do not thinke
But at your returne I shall be very thankfull.
Iaq.
As for that, it is sufficient your Ladiship is my sister; oh ye little amiable rogue you, a good face is a good dowry, I see sometimes; when we two tumbled both in a belly together, little did our mother thinke which should have beene the Madam; I might have beene cut the tother way iffaith, if it had pleased the sisters three, if the Mid∣wife had but knowne my minde when I was borne, I had beene two stone lighter; but much good do thee with thy good fortunes; farewell honourable flesh and bloud, I will deliver to my noble brother, pretty trim Lady, I thinke we are eyde alike; fare thee well, I cannot chuse but see thee as long as I look• upon thee.

I am as I was ever Lady,
Full of retyred thoughts.

You draw these backward
Should be comming on, and meet in nuptiall pleasures.
Ant.
All strive to be their owne Physitians (Lady)
We know whats best and fittest to be done,
But who can follow it?
Dio.
Till the disease be knowne
In vaine it were to study remedy,
Pray whats your cause of sadnesse?
Ant.
I have none, Lady.
Dio.
Why are you not merry then?
Ant.
You must finde fault with my complexion for't,
Nature, perhaps, has not compounded me
Of equall portions; yet you discover
Diseases outward, I not feele within,
Me thinkes I'me merry.
Dio.
No, I have heard you sigh so violent,

They have wak't my slumbers with you in bed,
One gust following another, as you woud breath
Out all your aire together, there most be cause.

But if youle trust me; Lazarello come hither.
Enter Clowne.

A murrin o the carrier brought me hither, I shall sit the worse this two dayes, but I thinke I have requited his sides for't; Now to my letter, pat yffaith, here's my noble brother; hum, I have a pestilent Lady to my sister, she told me I should finde him amongst Ladies; if she had said Lady she had guest singular well yffaith, I will carry it as well as I can for my honourable brothers credit.

Dio.
Fie, that's a lame excuse, you won not honour
Equall with your will, my selfe from the Castle saw you,
Most nobly do, I saw you unhorse three brave opposers,
You kild and captiv'd many enemies.
Laz:
Nay now sweet Lady
You make too strict an inquisition,
Men emulate in honour for the best.
Who woud be second that can formost 〈◊〉
For this a man may wrangle with 〈◊〉 fate,
And grieve and envy at anothers fortunes.
Iaq.
Hum, hum, hum.
Laz.
See you you fellow.
Ant.
Waft him hence good Lazarell•, I am undone else,
Looke here Dionisia, here's a iewell,
I never shewed thee yet.
Dio.
Tis a very pretty one,
Shall I have it?
Ant.

March hence, Antonio?

Some three dayes hence.
I must prepare to go:
Dio.
I'le go with you Antonio.
Ant.
By no meanes sweet, I'le send for thee
With more harmonious musique.
Dio.
Indeed I must.
Ant.
Come, come, indeed you shall not.
Laz.
He wonnot off Sir.
Ant.
A mischiefe carry him.
Iaq.
No! shall I have no notice taken of me!
I'le begin in another tone with you. Hum, hum, hum,
Sings.
There was a Nobleman of Spaine, Lady, Lady,
That went abroad, and came not againe
To his poore Lady.
Oh cruell age, when one proud brother, Lady, Lady,
Shall scorne to looke upon another,
Of his poore Lady.
Dio.
How now, what fellow's this?
Iaq.
No mans fellow here, Lady, yet a good fellow too
In place where.
Laz.
Who! this fellow, Lady! he that knows not him,
Knows not a man of mirth, this Doctor I tell you
Gives as good cure for the melancholy.
As the best Emperick in Spaine, what ere he be.
Dio.
I woud he woud practise on Antonio then.
Laz.
Troth Madam tis a good plot, please you to walke
I'le man you to the Castle, leave them together,
Tis an equall match, if he make him not merry,
Heele most terribly trouble his melancholly.
Ant.
Heele make me more sad I feare.
Dio.
I had rather stay and partake some mirth.
Iaq.
I am no womans foole (sweet Lady) tis two trades in Sivill; as your mans Taylor, and your womans Taylor: So your Lords foole, and your Ladies •oole, I am for the tongue, not for the bauble.

Looke thee theres black and white for thee from the little honourable ra••all my sister, and a thousand com∣mendations too without booke, which I was bid to tell thee by roat, if thou canst reade and heare all at once.

Ant.
Yes I can.

Iaq.
Theres honourable bones a breeding, my sister is the peevishest piece of Ladies flesh growne of late, we have good sport at it to see her vexe and fret, she boxes me as familiarly as if I were her Cobler, for talking to her, an un∣naturall varlet, to strike her owne flesh and bloud, but I beare with her for thy sake.

Ant.
I thanke you fort, brother.

Iaq.
Nay, she cuts her lace, and eats raw fruit too, what sallet do you thinke she long'd for tother day?

Ant.
I know not:

Iaq.
For a what doe call 'um? those long upright things that grow a yard above the ground; oh Cuckow pintle roots, but I got her her belly full at last.

Ant.
So twas well.

Iaq.
But the best lest was, she bit her shoomaker by the eare as he was drawing on her shoes; and another time her Taylor for girding her too straight, he had a long nose, but she did so pinch his bill; what, hast thou good newes bro∣ther?

Very good brother, all I reade are well.

Ant.
Stay brother, one thing I must aske you,
And pray you tell me, Whats your thought of me,
Finding me in a Ladies company?
Iaq.
O brother, I woud not have you thinke you have a foole to your kindred, what! I understand these toyes, there are fowle, and there are fish, there are wag-tayles, and there are Mermayds.

Ant.
Of what sort do you thinke she is?
Iaq.
Oh brother, definitions and distinctions! fie on 'um, come, I know flesh and bloud will be sporting. And I were a married man my selfe, I woud not alwayes be at home, I woud hawke, and hunt, and ride, there are divers members in one body, there are flesh dayes, and there are fish dayes, •man must not alwayes eate one sort of meat.

Ant.
I see you are a wag brother.

Iaq.
Alwayes let a married man get his owne children at home if he can, if he have a bit abroad for procreation or so—.

Ant.
Well good night brother, I pray hold a good opi∣nion of me.

Iaq:
O Sir, I can winke with one eye like a gunner, shall I make my sister sicke of the yelow laundies? no, thought is free, whatsoever I speak•, I'le say nothing; Vale, valete, valete, valetote.

Laz.
Now Sir, you are full of newes I'me sure.
Ant.
Heavy and froward newes: where's Dionisia?
Laz.
At distance enough in the Castle; you may speake.
Ant.
I am discover'd, Margaretta knowes of this
Her wrong, and my disloyalty.
Laz.
It was no mystery,
And must be found, but how does she beare it.
Ant.
Better then her birth,
Aswell as my addition to her, nobly,
And if her hand does not belye her heart,
She's glad that I have found an equall liking.
Laz.
She has done as becomes her.
Ant.
Yet with this request,
That I would not forsake her utterly,
But some times see her, tis articled too,
That twice a weeke sheed have my fellowship
By night, and private stealthes, the which obtainde,
Sheed loose the name of wife, and never shame
To be call'd my Concubine.
Laz.
I, this is well,
Fine light pageant worke, but now sure building,
This gilds a while, but will at length wash off agen;
This roofe must be raisde upon a sounder groundsill;
Give me your free bosome, you have one heart, and two wayes,
Which may have the better part freely.
Ant.
My conscience
And my affection warre about this quarrell,
My conscience saith the first, but my affection,
The second.
Laz.
So then, you shoud
Love Margaretta, but do love Dionisia.
Ant.
My heart's triangled, two points Dionisia•s,
And that downwards Margarets, and that's the smallest.
Laz.
I thanke you for this free delivery:
description
Page [unnumbered]
You seale your friendship to me, now let me build,
I ha'te, I'le rid your griefes at once; will you
But give consent.
Ant.
To any faire condition.
Laz.
No worse then Margarets request to you,
Or very little, returne your letter, that
You will satisfie all her desire, appoint
Your first nights approach, and privately.
Ant.
Night cannot hide it ever.
Laz.
But heare me,
You shall not go, I will supply your place,
Not to blemish, but to preserve your honour:
Command your entertainment, so secret be,
As that no lights may leade you to your chamber,
Let me alone to counterfeit for once,
And once shall serve for all, if it but take,
And that she bed with me, not for the act,
For there your honour must be weighed, but company,
Shall serve the turne, then rise I and proclaime
Both our luxurious sin〈…〉; how 〈◊〉 she then
Claime any part in you?
Ant.
Tis a strange extreame•
Laz.
Vlcers must have co〈…〉sives to eate, not •kinde,
Extreames must have extreames to co•pe withall.
It will not yeeld else.
Ant.
I like it, and allow it;
Tis more then water that must fight with wilde fire.
This passage shall be inst〈…〉ly preparde
With some of my wearin••, brought as neare my selfe
As art can make, this Ring to strengthen it,
I could subtract a third from my estate
To heale her iniury, and quite blot out
That •ain•s mine honour, being voyc't,
It must be curde; pardon heaven and Margaret,
There is an innate falling from what's good,
Which nothing can r•p•ire in's but our bloud.

Defiling her white lawne of chastity,
With ugly blacks of lust; what would you do?

Fire consume you geomantick Devils,
Where borrowed you those bodies, you damn'd theeves?
In your owne shapes you are not visible,
Or are you yet but fancies imaginarie?

My carcas forth, I am not sleeping now,
And my soule straid forth, I am my reall selfe,

He weares long locke,
And villanous socks,
Many nights in the stocks,
Endures some knocks,
And a many of mocks,
Eates reversions of cocks,
Yet lies in the flocks,
Thrives by the smocks,
And dies with the pox.
All this I have beene, and now desire to be hang'd for't.
Iaq.
What hast thou there?
Lo.
A hundred marks, besides leases, and lands which I have wickedly gotten, all which I will bestow on thee, if thou wilt take the paines to hang me.

Iaq:
Hum? my brother is dead, and there is no way to raise our house agen but by ready money or credit; the hangman many times mounts above his betters; well I will hang, but my conscience beares me witnesse, tis not for any good will I beare unto thee, nor for any wrong that I know thou hast committed; but innocently for thy lands, thy leases, thy clothes, and thy money. And so come a long with to me the next tree, where thou shalt hang till thou art dead, and stink above ground.

Your silence it confirmes, take hence their bodies,
Give them to Christians, and let th•• bestow
