                      ACT I. SCENE I.

       _The Country. A Room in_ CHAROMONTE'_s House_.

_Enter_ CHAROMONTE _and_ CONTARINO.

  _Char._ You bring your welcome with you.

  _Cont._ Sir, I find it
  In every circumstance.

  _Char._ Again most welcome.
  Yet, give me leave to wish (and pray you excuse me,
  For I must use the freedom I was born with)
  The great duke's pleasure had commanded you
  To my poor house upon some other service;
  Not this you are design'd to: but his will
  Must be obey'd, howe'er it ravish from me
  The happy conversation of one
  As dear to me as the old Romans held
  Their household Lars, whom they believed had power
  To bless and guard their families.

  _Cont._ 'Tis received so
  On my part, signior; nor can the duke
  But promise to himself as much as may
  Be hoped for from a nephew. And 'twere weakness
  In any man to doubt, that Giovanni[60],
  Train'd up by your experience and care
  In all those arts peculiar and proper
  To future greatness, of necessity
  Must in his actions, being grown a man,
  Make good the princely education
  Which he derived from you.

  _Char._ I have discharged,
  To the utmost of my power, the trust the duke
  Committed to me, and with joy perceive
  The seed of my endeavours was not sown
  Upon the barren sands, but fruitful glebe,
  Which yields a large increase: my noble charge,
  By his sharp wit, and pregnant apprehension,
  Instructing those that teach him; making use,
  Not in a vulgar and pedantic form,
  Of what's read to him, but 'tis straight digested,
  And truly made his own. His grave discourse,
  In one no more indebted unto years,
  Amazes such as hear him: horsemanship,
  And skill to use his weapon, are by practice
  Familiar to him: as for knowledge in
  Music, he needs it not, it being born with him;
  All that he speaks being with such grace deliver'd,
  That it makes perfect harmony.

  _Cont._ You describe
  A wonder to me.

  _Char._ Sir, he is no less;
  And that there may be nothing wanting that
  May render him complete, the sweetness of
  His disposition so wins on all
  Appointed to attend him, that they are
  Rivals, even in the coarsest office, who
  Shall get precedency to do him service;
  Which they esteem a greater happiness
  Than if they had been fashion'd and built up
  To hold command o'er others.

  _Cont._ And what place
  Does he now bless with his presence?

  _Char._ He is now
  Running at the ring[61], at which he's excellent.
  He does allot for every exercise
  A several hour; for sloth, the nurse of vices,
  And rust of action, is a stranger to him.
  But I fear I am tedious; let us pass,
  If you please, to some other subject, though I cannot
  Deliver him as he deserves.

  _Cont._ You have given him
  A noble character.

  _Char._ And how, I pray you,
  (For we, that never look beyond our villas,
  Must be inquisitive,) are state affairs
  Carried in court?

  _Cont._ There's little alteration:
  Some rise, and others fall, as it stands with
  The pleasure of the duke, their great disposer.

  _Char._ Does Lodovico Sanazarro hold
  Weight and grace with him?

  _Cont._ Every day new honours
  Are shower'd upon him, and without the envy
  Of such as are good men; since all confess
  The service done our master in his wars
  'Gainst Pisa and Sienna may with justice
  Claim what's conferr'd upon him.

  _Char._ 'Tis said nobly;
  For princes never more make known their wisdom,
  Than when they cherish goodness where they find it:
  They being men, and not gods, Contarino,
  They can give wealth and titles, but no virtues;
  That is without their power. When they advance,
  Not out of judgment, but deceiving fancy,
  An undeserving man, howe'er set off
  With all the trim of greatness, state, and power,
  And of a creature even grown terrible
  To him from whom he took his giant form,
  This thing is still a comet, no true star;
  And when the bounties feeding his false fire
  Begin to fail, will of itself go out,
  And what was dreadful proves ridiculous.
  But in our Sanazarro 'tis not so,
  He being pure and tried gold; and any stamp
  Of grace, to make him current to the world,
  The duke is pleased to give him, will add honour
  To the great bestower; for he, though allow'd
  Companion to his master, still preserves
  His majesty in full lustre.

  _Cont._ He, indeed,
  At no part does take from it, but becomes
  A partner of his cares, and eases him,
  With willing shoulders, of a burden which
  He should alone sustain.

  _Char._ Is he yet married?

  _Cont._ No, signior, still a bachelor; howe'er
  It is apparent that the choicest virgin
  For beauty, bravery, and wealth, in Florence,
  Would, with her parents' glad consent, be won,
  Were his affection and intent but known
  To be at his devotion.

  _Char._ So I think too.
  But break we off--here comes my princely charge.

_Enter_ GIOVANNI _and_ CALANDRINO.

  Make your approaches boldly; you will find
  A courteous entertainment.       [CONT. _kneels_.

  _Giov._ Pray you, forbear
  My hand, good signior; 'tis a ceremony
  Not due to me. 'Tis fit we should embrace
  With mutual arms.

  _Cont._ It is a favour, sir,
  I grieve to be denied.

  _Giov._ You shall o'ercome:
  But 'tis your pleasure, not my pride, that grants it.
  Nay, pray you, guardian, and good sir, put on:
  How ill it shows to have that reverend head
  Uncover'd to a boy!

  _Char._ Your excellence
  Must give me liberty to observe the distance
  And duty that I owe you.

  _Giov._ Owe me duty!
  I do profess (and when I do deny it,
  Good fortune leave me!) you have been to me
  A second father, and may justly challenge,
  For training up my youth in arts and arms,
  As much respect and service as was due
  To him that gave me life. And did you know, sir,
  Or will believe from me, how many sleeps
  Good Charomonte hath broken, in his care
  To build me up a man, you must confess
  Chiron, the tutor to the great Achilles,
  Compared with him, deserves not to be named.
  And if my gracious uncle, the great duke,
  Still holds me worthy his consideration,
  Or finds in me aught worthy to be loved,
  That little rivulet flow'd from this spring;
  And so from me report him.

  _Cont._ Fame already
  Hath fill'd his highness' ears with the true story
  Of what you are, and how much better'd by him;
  And 'tis his purpose to reward the travail
  Of this grave sir with a magnificent hand:
  For though his tenderness hardly could consent
  To have you one hour absent from his sight,
  For full three years he did deny himself
  The pleasure he took in you, that you, here,
  From this great master, might arrive unto
  The theory of those high mysteries
  Which you, by action, must make plain in court.
  'Tis, therefore, his request, (and that, from him,
  Your excellence must grant a strict command,)
  That instantly (it being not five hours' riding)
  You should take horse and visit him. These his letters
  Will yield you further reasons.      [_Delivers a packet._

  _Cal._ To the court!
  Farewell the flower, then, of the country's garland.
  This is our sun, and when he's set we must not
  Expect or spring or summer, but resolve
  For a perpetual winter.

  _Char._ Pray you, observe      [GIOVANNI _reading the letters_.
  The frequent changes in his face.

  _Cont._ As if
  His much unwillingness to leave your house
  Contended with his duty.

  _Char._ Now he appears
  Collected and resolved.

  _Giov._ It is the duke!
  The duke, upon whose favour all my hopes
  And fortunes do depend; nor must I check
  At his commands for any private motives
  That do invite my stay here, though they are
  Almost not to be master'd. My obedience,
  In my departing suddenly, shall confirm
  I am his highness' creature; yet I hope
  A little stay to take a solemn farewell
  Of all those ravishing pleasures I have tasted
  In this my sweet retirement, from my guardian
  And his incomparable daughter, cannot meet
  An ill construction.

  _Cont._ I will answer that:
  Use your own will.

  _Giov._ I would speak to you, sir,
  In such a phrase as might express the thanks
  My heart would gladly pay; but----

  _Char._ I conceive you:
  And something I would say; but I must do it
  In that dumb rhetoric which you make use of;
  For I do wish you all----I know not how,
  My toughness melts, and, spite of my discretion,
  I must turn woman.        [_Embraces_ GIOVANNI.

  _Cont._ What a sympathy
  There is between them!

  _Cal._ Were I on the rack,
  I could not shed a tear. But I am mad,
  And, ten to one, shall hang myself for sorrow
  Before I shift my shirt. But hear you, sir,
  (I'll separate you), when you are gone, what will
  Become of me?

  _Giov._ Why, thou shalt to court with me.
                                   [_Takes_ CHAR. _aside_.

  _Cal._ To see you worried?

  _Cont._ Worried, Calandrino!

  _Cal._ Yes, sir: for, bring this sweet face to the court,
  There will be such a longing 'mong the madams,
  Who shall engross it first, nay, fight and scratch for 't,
  That, if they be not stopp'd----So much for him.
  There's something else that troubles me.

  _Cont._ What's that?

  _Cal._ Why, how to behave myself in court, and tightly.
  I have been told the very place transforms men,
  And that not one of a thousand, that before
  Lived honestly in the country on plain salads,
  But bring him thither, mark me that, and feed him
  But a month or two with custards and court cake-bread,
  And he turns knave immediately.--I'd be honest;
  But I must follow the fashion, or die a beggar.

  _Giov._ And, if I ever reach my hopes, believe it,
  We will share fortunes.

  _Char._ This acknowledgment

_Enter_ LIDIA.

  Binds me your debtor ever.--Here comes one
  In whose sad looks you easily may read
  What her heart suffers, in that she is forced
  To take her last leave of you.

  _Cont._ As I live,
  A beauty without parallel!

  _Lid._ Must you go, then,
  So suddenly?

  _Giov._ There's no evasion, Lidia,
  To gain the least delay, though I would buy it
  At any rate. Greatness, with private men
  Esteem'd a blessing, is to me a curse;
  And we, whom, for our high births, they conclude
  The only freemen, are the only slaves.
  Happy the golden mean! Had I been born
  In a poor sordid cottage, not nursed up
  With expectation to command a court,
  I might, like such of your condition, sweetest,
  Have ta'en a safe and middle course, and not,
  As I am now, against my choice, compell'd
  Or to lie groveling on the earth, or raised
  So high upon the pinnacles of state,
  That I must either keep my height with danger,
  Or fall with certain ruin.

  _Lid._ Your own goodness
  Will be your faithful guard.

  _Giov._ O, Lidia!----

  _Cont._ So passionate[62]!      [_Aside._

  _Giov._ For, had I been your equal,
  I might have seen and liked with mine own eyes,
  And not, as now, with others'; I might still,
  And without observation or envy,
  As I have done, continued my delights
  With you, that are alone, in my esteem,
  The abstract of society: we might walk
  In solitary groves, or in choice gardens;
  From the variety of curious flowers
  Contemplate nature's workmanship and wonders:
  And then, for change, near to the murmur of
  Some bubbling fountain, I might hear you sing,
  And, from the well-tuned accents of your tongue,
  In my imagination conceive
  With what melodious harmony a quire
  Of angels sing above their Maker's praises:
  And then with chaste discourse, as we return'd,
  Imp[63] feathers to the broken wings of time:--
  And all this I must part from.

  _Cont._ You forget
  The haste imposed upon us.

  _Giov._ One word more,
  And then I come. And after this, when, with
  Continued innocence of love and service,
  I had grown ripe for hymeneal joys,
  Embracing you, but with a lawful flame,
  I might have been your husband.

  _Lid._ Sir, I was,
  And ever am, your servant; but it was,
  And 'tis, far from me in a thought to cherish
  Such saucy hopes. If I had been the heir
  Of all the globes and sceptres mankind bows to,
  At my best you had deserved me; as I am,
  Howe'er unworthy, in my virgin zeal
  I wish you, as a partner of your bed,
  A princess equal to you; such a one
  That may make it the study of her life,
  With all the obedience of a wife, to please you.
  May you have happy issue, and I live
  To be their humblest handmaid!

  _Giov._ I am dumb,
  And can make no reply.

  _Cont._ Your excellence
  Will be benighted.

  _Giov._ This kiss, bathed in tears,
  May learn you what I should say.

  _Lid._ Give me leave
  To wait on you to your horse.

  _Char._ And me to bring you
  To the one half of your journey.

  _Giov._ Your love puts
  Your age to too much trouble.

  _Char._ I grow young,
  When most I serve you.

  _Cont._ Sir, the duke shall thank you.      [_Exeunt._


                          SCENE II.

              _Florence. A Room in the Palace._

_Enter_ ALPHONSO, HIPPOLITO, _and_ HIERONIMO.

  _Alph._ His highness cannot take it ill.

  _Hip._ However,
  We with our duties shall express our care
  For the safety of his dukedom.

  _Hier._ And our loves

_Enter_ COZIMO.

  To his person.--Here he comes: present it boldly.
          [_They kneel_: ALPHONSO _tenders a paper_.

  _Coz._ What needs this form? We are not grown so proud
  As to disdain familiar conference
  With such as are to counsel and direct us.
  This kind of adoration show'd not well
  In the old Roman emperors, who, forgetting
  That they were flesh and blood, would be styled gods:
  In us to suffer it were worse. Pray you, rise.
                                            [_Reads._
  Still the old suit! With too much curiousness
  You have too often search'd this wound, which yields
  Security and rest, not trouble, to me.
  For here you grieve that my firm resolution
  Continues me a widower; and that
  My want of issue to succeed me in
  My government, when I am dead, may breed
  Distraction in the state, and make the name
  And family of the Medici, now admired,
  Contemptible.

  _Hip._ And with strong reasons, sir.

  _Alph._ For were you old, and past hope to beget
  The model of yourself, we should be silent.

  _Hier._ But being in your height and pride of years,
  As you are now, great sir; and having, too,
  In your possession the daughter of
  The deceased Duke of Urbin, and his heir,
  Whose guardian you are made; were you but pleased
  To think her worthy of you, besides children,
  The dukedom she brings with her for a dower
  Will yield a large increase of strength and power
  To those fair territories which already
  Acknowledge you their absolute lord.

  _Coz._ You press us
  With solid arguments, we grant; and, though
  We stand not bound to yield account to any
  Why we do this or that, (the full consent
  Of our subjects being included in our will,)
  We, out of our free bounties, will deliver
  The motives that divert[64] us. You well know
  That, three years since, to our much grief, we lost
  Our duchess; such a duchess, that the world,
  In her whole course of life[65], yields not a lady
  That can with imitation deserve
  To be her second; in her grave we buried
  All thoughts of woman: let this satisfy
  For any second marriage. Now, whereas
  You name the heir of Urbin, as a princess
  Of great revenues, 'tis confess'd she is so:
  But for some causes, private to ourself,
  We have disposed her otherwise. Yet despair not;
  For you, ere long, with joy shall understand,
  That in our princely care we have provided
  One worthy to succeed us.

_Enter_ SANAZARRO.

  _Hip._ We submit,
  And hold the counsels of great Cozimo
  Oraculous.

  _Coz._ My Sanazarro!--Nay,
  Forbear all ceremony. You look sprightly, friend,
  And promise in your clear aspect some novel
  That may delight us.

  _Sanaz._ O sir, I would not be
  The harbinger of aught that might distaste you;
  And therefore know (for 'twere a sin to torture
  Your highness' expectation) your vice-admiral,
  By my directions, hath surprised the galleys
  Appointed to transport the Asian tribute
  Of the great Turk. A richer prize was never
  Brought into Florence.

  _Coz._ Still my nightingale,
  That with sweet accents dost assure me that
  My spring of happiness comes fast upon me!
  Embrace me boldly. I pronounce that wretch
  An enemy to brave and thriving action,
  That dares believe but in a thought, we are
  Too prodigal in our favours to this man,
  Whose merits, though with him we should divide
  Our dukedom, still continue us his debtor.

  _Hip._ 'Tis far from me.

  _Alph._ We all applaud it.

  _Coz._ Nay, blush not, Sanazarro; we are proud
  Of what we build up in thee; nor can our
  Election be disparaged, since we have not
  Received into our bosom and our grace
  A glorious[66] lazy drone, grown fat with feeding
  On others' toil, but an industrious bee,
  That crops the sweet flowers of our enemies,
  And every happy evening returns
  Loaden with wax and honey to our hive.

  _Sanaz._ My best endeavours never can discharge
  The service I should pay.

  _Coz._ Thou art too modest;
  But we will study how to give, and when,

_Enter_ GIOVANNI _and_ CONTARINO.

  Before it be demanded.----Giovanni!
  My nephew! let me eye thee better, boy.
  In thee, methinks, my sister lives again;
  For her love I will be a father to thee,
  For thou art my adopted son.

  _Giov._ Your servant,
  And humblest subject.

  _Coz._ Thy hard travel, nephew,
  Requires soft rest, and therefore we forbear,
  For the present, an account how thou hast spent
  Thy absent hours. See, signiors, see, our care,
  Without a second bed, provides you of
  A hopeful prince. Carry him to his lodgings,
  And, for his further honour, Sanazarro,
  With the rest, do you attend him.

  _Giov._ All true pleasures
  Circle your highness!

  _Sanaz._ As the rising sun,
  We do receive you.

  _Giov._ May this never set,
  But shine upon you ever!
    [_Exeunt_ GIOVANNI, SANAZARRO, HIERONIMO, ALPHONSO, _and_ HIPPOLITO.

  _Coz._ Contarino!

  _Cont._ My gracious lord.

  _Coz._ What entertainment found you
  From Carolo de Charomonte?

  _Cont._ Free,
  And bountiful. He's ever like himself,
  Noble and hospitable.

  _Coz._ But did my nephew
  Depart thence willingly?

  _Cont._ He obey'd your summons
  As did become him. Yet it was apparent,
  But that he durst not cross your will, he would
  Have sojourn'd longer there, he ever finding
  Variety of sweetest entertainment.
  But there was something else; nor can I blame
  His youth, though with some trouble he took leave
  Of such a sweet companion.

  _Coz._ Who was it?

  _Cont._ The daughter, sir, of signior Carolo,
  Fair Lidia, a virgin, at all parts,
  But in her birth and fortunes, equal to him.
  The rarest beauties Italy can make boast of
  Are but mere shadows to her, she the substance
  Of all perfection. And what increases
  The wonder, sir, her body's matchless form
  Is better'd by the pureness of her soul.
  Such sweet discourse, such ravishing behaviour,
  Such charming language, such enchanting manners,
  With a simplicity that shames all courtship[67],
  Flow hourly from her, that I do believe
  Had Circe or Calypso her sweet graces,
  Wandering Ulysses never had remember'd
  Penelope, or Ithaca.

  _Coz._ Be not rapt so.

  _Cont._ Your excellence would be so, had you seen her.

  _Coz._ Take up, take up[68].--But did your observation
  Note any passage of affection
  Between her and my nephew?

  _Cont._ How it should
  Be otherwise between them, is beyond
  My best imagination. Cupid's arrows
  Were useless there; for of necessity,
  Their years and dispositions do accord so,
  They must wound one another.

  _Coz._ Umph! Thou art
  My secretary, Contarino, and more skill'd
  In politic designs of state, than in
  Thy judgment of a beauty; give me leave,
  In this, to doubt it.--Here. Go to my cabinet,
  You shall find there letters newly received,
  Touching the state of Urbin.
  Pray you, with care peruse them: leave the search
  Of this to us.

  _Cont._ I do obey in all things.      [_Exit._

  _Coz._ Lidia! a diamond so long conceal'd,
  And never worn in court! of such sweet feature!
  And he on whom I fix my dukedom's hopes
  Made captive to it! Umph! 'tis somewhat strange.
  Our eyes are every where, and we will make
  A strict inquiry.--Sanazarro!

_Re-enter_ SANAZARRO.

  _Sanaz._ Sir.

  _Coz._ Is my nephew at his rest?

  _Sanaz._ I saw him in bed, sir.

  _Coz._ 'Tis well; and does the princess Fiorinda,
  Nay, do not blush, she is rich Urbin's heir,
  Continue constant in her favours to you?

  _Sanaz._ Dread sir, she may dispense them as she pleases;
  But I look up to her as on a princess
  I dare not be ambitious of, and hope
  Her prodigal graces shall not render me
  Offender to your highness.

  _Coz._ Not a scruple.
  He whom I favour, as I do my friend,
  May take all lawful graces that become him:
  But touching this hereafter. I have now
  (And though perhaps it may appear a trifle)
  Serious employment for thee.

  _Sanaz._ I stand ready
  For any act you please.

  _Coz._ I know it, friend.
  Have you ne'er heard of Lidia, the daughter
  Of Carolo Charomonte?

  _Sanaz._ Him I know, sir,
  For a noble gentleman, and my worthy friend;
  But never heard of her.

  _Coz._ She is deliver'd,
  And feelingly to us, by Contarino,
  For a masterpiece in nature. I would have you
  Ride suddenly thither to behold this wonder,
  But not as sent by us; that's our first caution:
  The second is, and carefully observe it,
  That, though you are a bachelor, and endow'd with
  All those perfections that may take a virgin,
  On forfeit of our favour do not tempt her:
  It may be her fair graces do concern us.
  Pretend what business you think fit, to gain
  Access unto her father's house, and, there,
  Make full discovery of her, and return me
  A true relation:--I have some ends in it,
  With which we will acquaint you.

  _Sanaz._ This is, sir,
  An easy task.

  _Coz._ Yet one that must exact
  Your secrecy and diligence. Let not
  Your stay be long.

  _Sanaz._ It shall not, sir.

  _Coz._ Farewell,
  And be, as you would keep our favour, careful.
                                          [_Exeunt._



                      ACT II. SCENE I.

          _The same. A Room in_ FIORINDA'_s House_.

_Enter_ FIORINDA _and_ CALAMINTA.

  _Fior._ How does this dressing show?

  _Calam._ 'Tis of itself
  Curious and rare; but, borrowing ornament,
  As it does from your grace, that deigns to wear it,
  Incomparable.

  _Fior._ Thou flatter'st me.

  _Calam._ I cannot,
  Your excellence is above it.

  _Fior._ Were we less perfect,
  Yet, being as we are, an absolute princess,
  We of necessity must be chaste, wise, fair,
  By our prerogative!--yet all these fail
  To move where I would have them. How received
  Count Sanazarro the rich scarf I sent him
  For his last visit?

  _Calam._ With much reverence,
  I dare not say affection. He express'd
  More ceremony in his humble thanks,
  Than feeling of the favour; and appear'd
  Wilfully ignorant, in my opinion,
  Of what it did invite him to.

  _Fior._ No matter;
  He's blind with too much light[69]. Have you not heard
  Of any private mistress he's engaged to?

  _Calam._ Not any; and this does amaze me, madam,
  That he, a soldier, should in his manners
  Be so averse to women.

  _Fior._ Troth, I know not.

  _Calam._ I do suspect him; for I learnt last night,
  When the great duke went to rest, attended by
  One private follower, he took horse; but whither
  He's rid, or to what end, I cannot guess at,
  But I will find it out.

  _Fior._ Do, faithful servant;

_Enter_ CALANDRINO.

  We would not be abused.--Who have we here?

  _Calam._ How the fool stares!

  _Fior._ And looks as if he were
  Conning his neck-verse.

  _Cal._ If I now prove perfect
  In my A B C of courtship, Calandrino
  Is made for ever. I am sent--let me see,
  On a _How d'ye_, as they call 't.

  _Calam._ What wouldst thou say?

  _Cal._ Let me see my notes. These are her lodgings; well.

  _Calam._ Art thou an ass?

  _Cal._ Peace! thou art a court wagtail,
                           [_Looking on his instructions._
  To interrupt me.

  _Fior_. He has given it you.

  Cal. _And then say to the illustrious Fi-o-rin-da_--
  I have it. Which is she?

  _Calam._ Why this; fop-doodle.

  _Cal._ Leave chattering, bull-finch; you would put me out,
  But 'twill not do.--_Then, after you have made
  Your three obeisances to her, kneel, and kiss
  The skirt of her gown._--I am glad it is no worse.

  _Calam._ This is sport unlook'd for.

  _Cal._ Are you the princess?

  _Fior._ Yes, sir.

  _Cal._ Then stand fair,
  For I am choleric; and do not nip
  A hopeful blossom. Out again:--_Three low
  Obeisances_--

  _Fior._ I am ready.

  _Cal._ I come on, then.

  _Calam._ With much formality.

  _Cal._ Umph! One, two, three.
                           [_Makes antic courtesies._
  Thus far I am right. Now for the last. [_Kisses the
      skirt of her gown._]--O, rare!
  She is perfumed all over! Sure great women,
  Instead of little dogs, are privileged
  To carry musk-cats.

  _Fior._ Now the ceremony
  Is pass'd, what is the substance?

  _Cal._ I'll peruse
  My instructions, and then tell you.--_Her skirt kiss'd,
  Inform her highness that your lord_----

  _Calam._ Who's that?

  _Cal._ Prince Giovanni, who entreats your grace,
  That he, with your good favour, may have leave
  To present his service to you. I think I have nick'd it
  For a courtier of the first form.

  _Fior._ To my wonder.

_Enter_ GIOVANNI _and a Gentleman_.

  Return unto the prince--but he prevents
  My answer. Calaminta, take him off;
  And, for the neat delivery of his message,
  Give him ten ducats: such rare parts as yours
  Are to be cherish'd.

  _Cal._ We will share: I know
  It is the custom of the court, when ten
  Are promised, five is fair. Fie! fie! the princess
  Shall never know it, so you despatch me quickly,
  And bid me not come to-morrow.

  _Calam._ Very good, sir.
            [_Exeunt_ CALANDRINO _and_ CALAMINTA.

  _Giov._ Pray you, friend,
  Inform the duke I am putting into act
  What he commanded.

  _Gent._ I am proud to be employ'd, sir.      [_Exit._

  _Giov._ Madam, that, without warrant, I presume
  To trench upon your privacies, may argue
  Rudeness of manners; but the free access
  Your princely courtesy vouchsafes to all
  That come to pay their services, gives me hope
  To find a gracious pardon.

  _Fior._ If you please, not
  To make that an offence in your construction,
  Which I receive as a large favour from you,
  There needs not this apology.

  _Giov._ You continue,
  As you were ever, the greatest mistress of
  Fair entertainment.

  _Fior._ You are, sir, the master;
  And in the country have learnt to outdo
  All that in court is practised. But why should we
  Talk at such distance? You are welcome, sir.
  We have been more familiar, and since
  You will impose the province (you should govern)
  Of boldness on me, give me leave to say
  You are too punctual. Sit, sir, and discourse
  As we were used.

  _Giov._ Your excellence knows so well
  How to command, that I can never err
  When I obey you.

  _Fior._ Nay, no more of this.
  You shall o'ercome; no more, I pray you, sir.--
  And what delights, pray you be liberal
  In your relation, hath the country life
  Afforded you?

  _Giov._ All pleasures, gracious madam,
  But the happiness to converse with your sweet virtues.
  I had a grave instructor, and my hours
  Design'd to serious studies yielded me
  Pleasure with profit, in the knowledge of
  What before I was ignorant in; the signior,
  Carolo de Charomonte, being skilful
  To guide me through the labyrinth of wild passions,
  That labour'd to imprison my free soul
  A slave to vicious sloth.

  _Fior._ You speak him well.

  _Giov._ But short of his deserts. Then for the time
  Of recreation, I was allow'd
  (Against the form follow'd by jealous parents
  In Italy) full liberty to partake
  His daughter's sweet society. She's a virgin
  Happy in all endowments which a poet
  Could fancy in his mistress; being herself
  A school of goodness, where chaste maids may learn,
  Without the aids of foreign principles,
  By the example of her life and pureness,
  To be as she is, excellent. I but give you
  A brief epitome of her virtues, which,
  Dilated on at large, and to their merit,
  Would make an ample story.

  _Fior._ Your whole age,
  So spent with such a father, and a daughter,
  Could not be tedious to you.

  _Giov._ True, great princess:
  And now, since you have pleased to grant the hearing
  Of my time's expense in the country, give me leave
  To entreat the favour to be made acquainted
  What service, or what objects in the court,
  Have, in your excellency's acceptance, proved
  Most gracious to you.

  _Fior._ I'll meet your demand,
  And make a plain discovery. The duke's care
  For my estate and person holds the first
  And choicest place: then, the respect the courtiers
  Pay gladly to me, not to be contemn'd.
  But that which raised in me the most delight,
  (For I am a friend to valour,) was to hear
  The noble actions truly reported
  Of the brave count Sanazarro. I profess,
  When it hath been, and fervently, deliver'd,
  How boldly, in the horror of a fight,
  Cover'd with fire and smoke, and, as if nature
  Had lent him wings, like lightning he hath fallen
  Upon the Turkish galleys, I have heard it
  With a kind of pleasure, which hath whisper'd to me,
  This worthy must be cherish'd.

  _Giov._ 'Twas a bounty
  You never can repent.

  _Fior._ I glory in it.
  And when he did return, (but still with conquest,)
  His armour off, not young Antinous
  Appear'd more courtly; all the graces that
  Render a man's society dear to ladies,
  Like pages waiting on him; and it does
  Work strangely on me.

  _Giov._ To divert your thoughts,
  Though they are fix'd upon a noble subject,
  I am a suitor to you.

  _Fior._ You will ask,
  I do presume, what I may grant, and then
  It must not be denied.

  _Giov._ It is a favour
  For which I hope your excellence will thank me.

  _Fior._ Nay, without circumstance.

  _Giov._ That you would please
  To take occasion to move the duke,
  That you, with his allowance, may command
  This matchless virgin, Lidia, (of whom
  I cannot speak too much,) to wait upon you.
  She's such a one, upon the forfeit of
  Your good opinion of me, that will not
  Be a blemish to your train.

  _Fior._ 'Tis rank! he loves her:
  But I will fit him with a suit. [_Aside._]--I pause not,
  As if it bred or doubt or scruple in me
  To do what you desire, for I'll effect it,
  And make use of a fair and fit occasion;
  Yet, in return, I ask a boon of you,
  And hope to find you, in your grant to me,
  As I have been to you.

  _Giov._ Command me, madam.

  _Fior._ 'Tis near allied to yours. That you would be
  A suitor to the duke, not to expose,
  After so many trials of his faith,
  The noble Sanazarro to all dangers,
  As if he were a wall to stand the fury
  Of a perpetual battery: but now
  To grant him, after his long labours, rest
  And liberty to live in court; his arms
  And his victorious sword and shield hung up
  For monuments.

  _Giov._ Umph!--I'll embrace, fair princess,

_Enter_ COZIMO.

  The soonest opportunity. The duke!

  _Coz._ Nay, blush not; we smile on your privacy,
  And come not to disturb you. You are equals,
  And, without prejudice to either's honours,
  May make a mutual change of love and courtship,
  Till you are made one, and with holy rites,
  And we give suffrage to it.

  _Giov._ You are gracious.

  _Coz._ To ourself in this: but now break off; too much
  Taken at once of the most curious viands,
  Dulls the sharp edge of appetite. We are now
  For other sports, in which our pleasure is
  That you should keep us company.

  _Fior._ We attend you.      [_Exeunt._

                          SCENE II.

        _The Country. A Hall in_ CHAROMONTE'_s House._

_Enter_ BERNARDO, CAPONI, _and_ PETRUCHIO.

  _Bern._ Is my lord stirring?

  _Cap._ No; he's fast.

  _Pet._ Let us take, then,
  Our morning draught. Such as eat store of beef,
  Mutton, and capons, may preserve their healths
  With that thin composition call'd small beer,
  As, 'tis said, they do in England. But Italians,
  That think when they have supp'd upon an olive,
  A root, or bunch of raisins, 'tis a feast,
  Must kill those crudities rising from cold herbs,
  With hot and lusty wines.

  _Cap._ A happiness
  Those tramontanes[70] ne'er tasted.

  _Bern._ Have they not
  Store of wine there?

  _Cap._ Yes, and drink more in two hours
  Than the Dutchmen or the Dane in four and twenty.

  _Pet._ But what is 't? French trash, made of rotten grapes,
  And dregs and lees of Spain, with Welsh metheglin,
  A drench to kill a horse! But this pure nectar,
  Being proper to our climate, is too fine
  To brook the roughness of the sea: the spirit
  Of this begets in us quick apprehensions,
  And active executions; whereas their
  Gross feeding makes their understanding like it:
  They can fight, and that's their all.      [_They drink._

_Enter_ SANAZARRO _and_ SERVANI.

  _Sanaz._ Security
  Dwells about this house, I think; the gate's wide open,
  And not a servant stirring. See the horses
  Set up, and clothed.

  _Serv._ I shall, sir.      [_Exit._

  _Sanaz._ I'll make bold
  To press a little further.

  _Bern._ Who is this,
  Count Sanazarro?

  _Pet._ Yes, I know him. Quickly
  Remove the flagon.

  _Sanaz._ A good day to you, friends.
  Nay, do not conceal your physic; I approve it,
  And, if you please, will be a patient with you.

  _Pet._ My noble lord.      [_Drinks._

  _Sanaz._ A health to yours. [_Drinks._] Well done!
  I see you love yourselves, and I commend you;
  'Tis the best wisdom.

  _Pet._ May it please your honour
  To walk a turn in the gallery, I'll acquaint
  My lord with your being here.               [_Exit._

  _Sanaz._ Tell him I come
  For a visit only. 'Tis a handsome pile this.      [_Exit._

  _Cap._ Why here is a brave fellow, and a right one;
  Nor wealth nor greatness makes him proud.

  _Bern._ There are
  Too few of them; for most of our new courtiers,
  (Whose fathers were familiar with the prices
  Of oil and corn, with when and where to vent them,
  And left their heirs rich, from their knowledge that way,)
  Like gourds shot up in a night, disdain to speak
  But to cloth of tissue.

_Enter_ CHAROMONTE _in a nightgown_, PETRUCHIO _following_.

  _Char._ Stand you prating, knaves,
  When such a guest is under my roof! See all
  The rooms perfumed. This is the man that carries
  The sway and swing of the court; and I had rather
  Preserve him mine with honest offices, than----
  But I'll make no comparisons. Bid my daughter
  Trim herself up to the height. Which way went he?

  _Cap._ To the round gallery.

  _Char._ I will entertain him
  As fits his worth and quality, but no further.
                                           [_Exeunt._


FOOTNOTE:

[70] _Tramontanes,_] i. e. _strangers_, _barbarians_: so the Italians
     called, and still call, all who live beyond the Alps, _ultra
     montes_. In a subsequent speech, the author does not forget to
     satirize the acknowledged propensity of his countrymen to drinking:
     "Your _Dane_, your German, and your swag-bellied _Hollander_, are
     nothing to your Englishman."

     If Caponi, as well as Iago, be not, however, too severe upon us,
     it must be confessed that our ancestors were apt scholars, and
     soon bettered the instructions which they received. Sir Richard
     Baker (as Mr. Gilchrist observes), treating of the wars in the
     Low-Countries about the end of the sixteenth century, says, "Here
     it must not be omitted, that the English (who, of all the dwellers
     in the northern parts of the world, were hitherto the least
     drinkers, and deservedly praised for their sobriety) in these
     Dutch wars learned to be drunkards, and brought the vice so far to
     overspread the kingdom, that laws were fain to be enacted for
     repressing it." _Chron._ fol. p. 382.--GIFFORD.


                         SCENE III.

                  _A Gallery in the same._

_Enter_ SANAZARRO.

  _Sanaz._ I cannot apprehend, yet I have argued
  All ways I can imagine, for what reasons
  The great duke does employ me hither; and,
  What does increase the miracle, I must render
  A strict and true account, at my return,
  Of Lidia, this lord's daughter, and describe
  In what she's excellent, and where defective.
  'Tis a hard task: he that will undergo
  To make a judgment of a woman's beauty,
  And see through all her plasterings and paintings,
  Had need of Lynceus' eyes, and with more ease
  May look, like him, through nine mud walls, than make
  A true discovery of her. But the intents
  And secrets of my prince's heart must be
  Served, and not search'd into.

_Enter_ CHAROMONTE.

  _Char._ Most noble sir,
  Excuse my age, subject to ease and sloth,
  That with no greater speed I have presented
  My service with your welcome.

  _Sanaz._ 'Tis more fit
  That I should ask your pardon, for disturbing
  Your rest at this unseasonable hour.
  But my occasions carrying me so near
  Your hospitable house, my stay being short too,
  Your goodness, and the name of friend, which you
  Are pleased to grace me with, gave me assurance
  A visit would not offend.

  _Char._ Offend, my lord!
  I feel myself much younger for the favour.
  How is it with our gracious master?

  _Sanaz._ He, sir,
  Holds still his wonted greatness, and confesses
  Himself your debtor, for your love and care
  To the prince Giovanni; and had sent
  Particular thanks by me, had his grace known
  The quick despatch of what I was design'd to
  Would have licensed me to see you.

  _Char._ I am rich
  In his acknowledgment.

  _Sanaz._ I have heard
  Your happiness in a daughter.

  _Char._ Sits the wind there?      [_Aside._

  _Sanaz._ Fame gives her out for a rare masterpiece.

  _Char._ 'Tis a plain village girl, sir, but obedient;
  That's her best beauty, sir.

  _Sanaz._ Let my desire
  To see her find a fair construction from you:
  I bring no loose thought with me.

  _Char._ You are that way,
  My lord, free from suspicion. Her own manners,
  Without an imposition from me,
  I hope, will prompt her to it.

_Enter_ LIDIA _and_ PETRONELLA.

                                 As she is,
  She comes to make a tender of that service
  Which she stands bound to pay.

  _Sanaz._ With your fair leave,
  I make bold to salute you.

  _Lid._ Sir, you have it.

  _Char._ How he falls off!

  _Lid._ My lord, though silence best becomes a maid,
  And to be curious to know but what
  Concerns myself, and with becoming distance,
  May argue me of boldness, I must borrow
  So much of modesty, as to inquire
  Prince Giovanni's health.

  _Sanaz._ He cannot want
  What you are pleased to wish him.

  _Lid._ Would 'twere so!
  And then there is no blessing that can make
  A hopeful and a noble prince complete,
  But should fall on him. O! he was our north star,
  The light and pleasure of our eyes.

  _Sanaz._ Where am I?
  I feel myself another thing! Can charms
  Be writ on such pure rubies[71]? her lips melt
  As soon as touch'd! Not those smooth gales that glide
  O'er happy Araby, or rich Sabæa,
  Creating in their passage gums and spices,
  Can serve for a weak simile to express
  The sweetness of her breath. Such a brave stature
  Homer bestow'd on Pallas, every limb
  Proportion'd to it!

  _Char._ This is strange.--My lord!

  _Sanaz._ I crave your pardon, and yours, matchless maid,
  For such I must report you.

  _Petron._ There's no notice
  Taken all this while of me.      [_Aside._

  _Sanaz._ And I must add,
  If your discourse and reason parallel
  The rareness of your more than human form,
  You are a wonder.

  _Char._ Pray you, my lord, make trial:
  She can speak, I can assure you; and that my presence
  May not take from her freedom, I will leave you:
  For know, my lord, my confidence dares trust her
  Where, and with whom, she pleases.--Petronella!

  _Petron._ Yes, my good lord.

  _Char._ I have employment for you.
           [_Exeunt_ CHAROMONTE _and_ PETRONELLA.

  _Lid._ What's your will, sir?

  _Sanaz._ Madam, you are so large a theme to treat of,
  And every grace about you offers to me
  Such copiousness of language, that I stand
  Doubtful which first to touch at. If I err,
  As in my choice I may, let me entreat you,
  Before I do offend, to sign my pardon:
  Let this, the emblem of your innocence,
  Give me assurance.

  _Lid._ My hand join'd to yours,
  Without this superstition, confirms it.
  Nor need I fear you will dwell long upon me,
  The barrenness of the subject yielding nothing
  That rhetoric, with all her tropes and figures,
  Can amplify. Yet since you are resolved
  To prove yourself a courtier in my praise,
  As I'm a woman (and you men affirm
  Our sex loves to be flatter'd) I'll endure it.

_Enter_ CHAROMONTE _above_.

  Now, when you please, begin.

  _Sanaz._ [_turning from her._] If the great duke
  Made this his end to try my constant temper,
  Though I am vanquished, 'tis his fault, not mine;
  For I am flesh and blood, and have affections
  Like other men. Who can behold the temples,
  Or holy altars, but the objects work
  Devotion in him? And I may as well
  Walk over burning iron with bare feet,
  And be unscorch'd, as look upon this beauty
  Without desire, and that desire pursued too,
  Till it be quench'd with the enjoying those
  Delights, which to achieve, danger is nothing,
  And loyalty but a word.

  _Lid._ I ne'er was proud;
  Nor can find I am guilty of a thought
  Deserving this neglect.

  _Sanaz._ Suppose his greatness
  Loves her himself, why makes he choice of me
  To be his agent? It is tyranny
  To call one pinch'd with hunger to a feast,
  And at that instant cruelly deny him
  To taste of what he sees. Allegiance
  Tempted too far is like the trial of
  A good sword on an anvil; as that often
  Flies in pieces without service to the owner,
  So trust enforced too far proves treachery,
  And is too late repented.

  _Lid._ Pray you, sir,
  Or license me to leave you, or deliver
  The reasons which invite you to command
  My tedious waiting on you.

  _Char._ As I live,
  I know not what to think on 't. Is 't his pride,
  Or his simplicity?

  _Sanaz._ Whither have my thoughts
  Carried me from myself? In this my dulness,
  I've lost an opportunity----
                        [_Turns to her; she falls off._

  _Lid._ 'Tis true
  I was not bred in court, nor live a star there;
  Nor shine in rich embroideries and pearl,
  As they that are the mistresses of great fortunes
  Are every day adorn'd with----

  _Sanaz._ Will you vouchsafe
  Your ear, sweet lady?

  _Lid._ Yet I may be bold,
  For my integrity and fame, to rank
  With such as are more glorious. Though I never
  Did injury, yet I am sensible
  When I'm contemn'd and scorn'd.

  _Sanaz._ Will you please to hear me?

  _Lid._ O the difference of natures! Giovanni,
  A prince in expectation, when he lived here,
  Stole courtesy from heaven[72], and would not to
  The meanest servant in my father's house
  Have kept such distance.

  _Sanaz._ Pray you, do not think me
  Unworthy of your ear: it was your beauty
  That turn'd me statue. I can speak, fair lady.

  _Lid._ And I can hear. The harshness of your courtship
  Cannot corrupt my courtesy.

  _Sanaz._ Will you hear me,
  If I speak of love?

  _Lid._ Provided you be modest;
  I were uncivil, else.

  _Char._ They are come to parley:
  I must observe this nearer.           [_He retires._

  _Sanaz._ You are a rare one,
  And such (but that my haste commands me hence)
  I could converse with ever. Will you grace me
  With leave to visit you again?

  _Lid._ So you,
  At your return to court, do me the favour
  To make a tender of my humble service
  To the prince Giovanni.

  _Sanaz._ Ever touching
  Upon that string! [_Aside._] And will you give me hope
  Of future happiness?

  _Lid._ That, as I shall find you:
  The fort that's yielded at the first assault
  Is hardly worth the taking.

_Re-enter_ CHAROMONTE _below_.

  _Sanaz._ She is a magazine of all perfection,
  And 'tis death to part from her, yet I must.

  _Char._ A homely breakfast does attend your lordship,
  Such as the place affords.

  _Sanaz._ No; I have feasted
  Already here; my thanks, and so I leave you:
  I will see you again.--Till this unhappy hour
  I was never lost; and what to do, or say,
  I have not yet determined.      [_Aside, and exit._

  _Char._ Gone so abruptly!
  'Tis very strange.

  _Lid._ Under your favour, sir,
  His coming hither was to little purpose,
  For any thing I heard from him.

  _Char._ Take heed, Lidia!
  I do advise you with a father's love,
  And tenderness of your honour; as I would not
  Have you too harsh in giving entertainment,
  So by no means be credulous: for great men,
  Till they have gain'd their ends, are giants in
  Their promises, but, those obtain'd, weak pigmies
  In their performance. And it is a maxim
  Allow'd among them, so they may deceive,
  They may swear any thing; for the queen of love,
  As they hold constantly, does never punish,
  But smile at, lovers' perjuries[73].--Yet be wise too,
  And when you are sued to in a noble way,
  Be neither nice nor scrupulous.

  _Lid._ All you speak, sir,
  I hear as oracles; nor will digress
  From your directions.

  _Char._ So shall you keep Your fame untainted.

  _Lid._ As I would my life, sir.      [_Exeunt._



                     ACT III. SCENE I.

          _Florence. An Anteroom in the Palace._

_Enter_ SANAZARRO _and Servant_.

  _Sanaz._ Leave the horses with my grooms; but be you careful,
  With your best diligence and speed, to find out
  The prince, and humbly, in my name, entreat
  I may exchange some private conference with him
  Before the great duke know of my arrival.

  _Serv._ I haste, my lord.

  _Sanaz._ Here I'll attend his coming:
  And see you keep yourself, as much as may be,
  Conceal'd from all men else.

  _Serv._ To serve your lordship,
  I wish I were invisible.             [_Exit._

  _Sanaz._ I am driven
  Into a desperate strait, and cannot steer
  A middle course; and of the two extremes
  Which I must make election of, I know not
  Which is more full of horror. Never servant
  Stood more engaged to a magnificent master,
  Than I to Cozimo: and all those honours
  And glories by his grace conferr'd upon me,
  Or by my prosperous services deserved,
  If now I should deceive his trust, and make
  A shipwreck of my loyalty, are ruin'd.
  And, on the other side, if I discover
  Lidia's divine perfections, all my hopes
  In her are sunk, never to be buoy'd up:
  For 'tis impossible, but, as soon as seen,
  She must with adoration be sued to.
  A hermit at his beads but looking on her
  At this object would take fire. Nor is the duke
  Such an Hippolytus, but that this Phædra,
  But seen, must force him to forsake the groves
  And Dian's huntmanship, proud to serve under
  Venus' soft ensigns. No, there is no way
  For me to hope fruition of my ends,
  But to conceal her beauties;--and how that
  May be effected is as hard a task
  As with a veil to cover the sun's beams,
  Or comfortable light. Three years the prince
  Lived in her company, and Contarino,
  The secretary, hath possess'd[74] the duke
  What a rare piece she is:--but he's my creature,
  And may with ease be frighted to deny
  What he hath said: and if my long experience,
  With some strong reasons I have thought upon,
  Cannot o'er-reach a youth, my practice yields me
  But little profit.

_Enter_ GIOVANNI _with the Servant_.

  _Giov._ You are well return'd, sir.

  _Sanaz._ Leave us.--[_Exit Servant._] When that
      your grace shall know the motives
  That forced me to invite you to this trouble,
  You will excuse my manners.

  _Giov._ Sir, there needs not
  This circumstance between us. You are ever
  My noble friend.

  _Sanaz._ You shall have further cause
  To assure you of my faith and zeal to serve you:
  And when I have committed to your trust
  (Presuming still on your retentive silence)
  A secret of no less importance than
  My honour, nay, my head, it will confirm
  What value you hold with me.

  _Giov._ Pray you, believe, sir,
  What you deliver to me shall be lock'd up
  In a strong cabinet, of which you yourself
  Shall keep the key; for here I pawn my honour,
  Which is the best security I can give yet,
  It shall not be discover'd.

  _Sanaz._ This assurance
  Is more than I with modesty could demand
  From such a paymaster; but I must be sudden;
  And, therefore, to the purpose. Can your excellence,
  In your imagination, conceive
  On what design, or whither, the duke's will
  Commanded me hence last night?

  _Giov._ No, I assure you;
  And it had been a rudeness to inquire
  Of that I was not call'd to.

  _Sanaz._ Grant me hearing,
  And I will make you truly understand
  It only did concern you.

  _Giov._ Me, my lord!

  _Sanaz._ You, in your present state and future fortunes;
  For both lie at the stake.

  _Giov._ You much amaze me.
  Pray you, resolve this riddle.

  _Sanaz._ You know the duke,
  If he die issueless, as yet he is,
  Determines you his heir.

  _Giov._ It hath pleased his highness
  Oft to profess so much.

  _Sanaz._ But say he should
  Be won to prove a second wife, on whom
  He may beget a son, how, in a moment,
  Will all those glorious expectations, which
  Render you reverenced and remarkable,
  Be in a moment blasted, howe'er you are
  His much-loved sister's son!

  _Giov._ I must bear it
  With patience, and in me it is a duty
  That I was born with; and 'twere much unfit
  For the receiver of a benefit
  To offer, for his own ends, to prescribe
  Laws to the giver's pleasure.

  _Sanaz._ Sweetly answer'd,
  And like your noble self. This your rare temper
  So wins upon me, that I would not live
  (If that by honest arts I can prevent it)
  To see your hopes made frustrate. And but think
  How you shall be transform'd from what you are,
  Should this (as Heaven avert it!) ever happen.
  It must disturb your peace: for whereas now,
  Being, as you are, received for the heir-apparent,
  You are no sooner seen but wonder'd at;
  The signiors making it a business to
  Inquire how you have slept; and, as you walk
  The streets of Florence, the glad multitude
  In throngs press but to see you; and, with joy,
  The father, pointing with his finger, tells
  His son, This is the prince, the hopeful prince,
  That must hereafter rule, and you obey him.--
  Great ladies beg your picture, and make love
  To that, despairing to enjoy the substance.--
  And but the last night, when 'twas only rumour'd
  That you were come to court, as if you had
  By sea pass'd hither from another world,
  What general shouts and acclamations follow'd!
  The bells rang loud, the bonfires blazed, and such
  As loved not wine, carousing to your health,
  Were drunk, and blush'd not at it. And is this
  A happiness to part with?

  _Giov._ I allow these
  As flourishes of fortune, with which princes
  Are often soothed; but never yet esteem'd them
  For real blessings.

  _Sanaz._ Yet all these were paid
  To what you may be, not to what you are;
  For if the Great Duke but show to his servants
  A son of his own, you shall, like one obscure,
  Pass unregarded.

  _Giov._ I confess, command
  Is not to be contemn'd, and if my fate
  Appoint me to it, as I may, I'll bear it
  With willing shoulders. But, my lord, as yet,
  You've told me of a danger coming towards me,
  But have not named it.

  _Sanaz._ That is soon deliver'd.
  Great Cozimo, your uncle, as I more
  Than guess, for 'tis no frivolous circumstance
  That does persuade my judgment to believe it,
  Purposes to be married.

  _Giov._ Married, sir!
  With whom, and on what terms? pray you, instruct
  me.

  _Sanaz._ With the fair Lidia.

  _Giov._ Lidia!

  _Sanaz._ The daughter
  Of signior Charomonte.

  _Giov._ Pardon me
  Though I appear incredulous; for, on
  My knowledge, he ne'er saw her.

  _Sanaz._ That is granted:
  But Contarino hath so sung her praises,
  And given her out for such a masterpiece,
  That he's transported with it, sir:--and love
  Steals sometimes through the ear into the heart,
  As well as by the eye. The duke no sooner
  Heard her described, but I was sent in post
  To see her, and return my judgment of her.

  _Giov._ And what's your censure[75]?

  _Sanaz._ 'Tis a pretty creature.

  _Giov._ She's very fair.

  _Sanaz._ Yes, yes, I have seen worse faces.

  _Giov._ Her limbs are neatly form'd.

  _Sanaz._ She hath a waist
  Indeed sized to love's wish.

  _Giov._ A delicate hand too.

  _Sanaz._ Then for a leg and foot--

  _Giov._ And there I leave you,
  For I presumed no further.

  _Sanaz._ As she is, sir,
  I know she wants no gracious part that may
  Allure the duke; and, if he only see her,
  She is his own; he will not be denied,
  And then you are lost: yet, if you'll second me,
  (As you have reason, for it most concerns you,)
  I can prevent all yet.

  _Giov._ I would you could,
  A noble way.

  _Sanaz._ I will cry down her beauties;
  Especially the beauties of her mind,
  As much as Contarino hath advanced them;
  And this, I hope, will breed forgetfulness,
  And kill affection in him: but you must join
  With me in my report, if you be question'd.

  _Giov._ I never told a lie yet; and I hold it
  In some degree blasphémous[76] to dispraise
  What's worthy admiration: yet, for once,
  I will dispraise a little, and not vary
  From your relation.

  _Sanaz._ Be constant in it.

_Enter_ ALPHONSO.

  _Alph._ My lord, the duke hath seen your man, and wonders

_Enter_ COZIMO, HIPPOLITO, CONTARINO, _and Attendants._

  You come not to him. See, if his desire
  To have conference with you hath not brought him hither
  In his own person!

  _Coz._ They are comely coursers,
  And promise swiftness.

  _Cont._ They are, of my knowledge,
  Of the best race in Naples.

  _Coz._ You are, nephew,
  As I hear, an excellent horseman, and we like it:
  'Tis a fair grace in a prince. Pray you, make trial
  Of their strength and speed; and, if you think them fit
  For your employment, with a liberal hand
  Reward the gentleman that did present them
  From the viceroy of Naples.

  _Giov._ I will use
  My best endeavour, sir.

  _Coz._ Wait on my nephew.
   [_Exeunt_ GIOVANNI, ALPHONSO, HIPPOLITO, _and Attendants._
  Nay, stay you, Contarino:--be within call;
  It may be we shall use you. [_Exit_ CONTARINO.]
      You have rode hard, sir,
  And we thank you for it: every minute seems
  Irksome, and tedious to us, till you have
  Made your discovery. Say, friend, have you seen
  This phoenix of our age?

  _Sanaz._ I have seen a maid, sir;
  But, if that I have judgment, no such wonder
  As she was deliver'd to you.

  _Coz._ This is strange.

  _Sanaz._ But certain truth. It may be, she was
  look'd on
  With admiration in the country, sir;
  But, if compared with many in your court,
  She would appear but ordinary.

  _Coz._ Contarino
  Reports her otherwise.

  _Sanaz._ Such as ne'er saw swans
  May think crows beautiful.

  _Coz._ How is her behaviour?

  _Sanaz._ 'Tis like the place she lives in.

  _Coz._ How her wit,
  Discourse, and entertainment?

  _Sanaz._ Very coarse;
  I would not willingly say poor, and rude:
  But, had she all the beauties of fair women,
  The dulness of her soul would fright me from her.

  _Coz._ You are curious, sir. I know not what to think on 't.--
      [_Aside._
  Contarino!

_Re-enter_ CONTARINO.

  _Cont._ Sir.

  _Coz._ Where was thy judgment, man,
  To extol a virgin Sanazarro tells me
  Is nearer to deformity?

  _Sanaz._ I saw her,
  And curiously perused her; and I wonder
  That she, that did appear to me, that know
  What beauty is, not worthy the observing,
  Should so transport you.

  _Cont._ Troth, my lord, I thought then----

  _Coz._ Thought! Didst thou not affirm it?

  _Cont._ I confess, sir,
  I did believe so then; but now I hear
  My lord's opinion to the contrary,
  I am of another faith: for 'tis not fit
  That I should contradict him. I am dim, sir;
  But he's sharp-sighted.

  _Sanaz._ This is to my wish.      [_Aside._

  _Coz._ We know not what to think of this; yet
  would not

_Re-enter_ GIOVANNI, HIPPOLITO, _and_ ALPHONSO.

  Determine rashly of it. [_Aside._]--How do you like
  My nephew's horsemanship?

  _Hip._ In my judgment, sir,
  It is exact and rare.

  _Alph._ And, to my fancy,
  He did present great Alexander mounted
  On his Bucephalus.

  _Coz._ You are right, courtiers,
  And know it is your duty to cry up
  All actions of a prince.

  _Sanaz._ Do not betray
  Yourself, you're safe; I have done my part.
                               [_Aside to_ GIOVANNI.

  _Giov._ I thank you;
  Nor will I fail.

  _Coz._ What's your opinion, nephew,
  Of the horses?

  _Giov._ Two of them are, in my judgment,
  The best I ever back'd; I mean the roan, sir,
  And the brown bay: but for the chestnut-colour'd,
  Though he be full of metal, hot, and fiery,
  He treads weak in his pasterns.

  _Coz._ So: come nearer;
  This exercise hath put you into a sweat;
  Take this and dry it: and now I command you
  To tell me truly what's your censure of
  Charomonte's daughter, Lidia.

  _Giov._ I am, sir,
  A novice in my judgment of a lady;
  But such as 'tis, your grace shall have it freely.
  I would not speak ill of her, and am sorry,
  If I keep myself a friend to truth, I cannot
  Report her as I would, so much I owe
  Her reverend father: but I'll give you, sir,
  As near as I can, her character in little.
  She's of a goodly stature, and her limbs
  Not disproportion'd; for her face, it is
  Far from deformity; yet they flatter her,
  That style it excellent: her manners are
  Simple and innocent; but her discourse
  And wit deserve my pity, more than praise:
  At the best, my lord, she is a handsome picture,
  And, that said, all is spoken.

  _Coz._ I believe you;
  I ne'er yet found you false.

  _Giov._ Nor ever shall, sir.--
  Forgive me, matchless Lidia! too much love,
  And jealous fear to lose thee, do compel me,
  Against my will, my reason, and my knowledge,
  To be a poor detractor of that beauty,
  Which fluent Ovid, if he lived again,
  Would want words to express.          [_Aside._

  _Coz._ Pray you, make choice of
  The richest of our furniture for these horses,
                                     [_To_ SANAZARRO.
  And take my nephew with you; we in this
  Will follow his directions.

  _Giov._ Could I find now
  The princess Fiorinda, and persuade her
  To be silent in the suit that I moved to her,
  All were secure.

  _Sanaz._ In that, my lord, I'll aid you.

  _Coz._ We will be private; leave us.
                              [_Exeunt all but_ COZIMO.
                                     All my studies
  And serious meditations aim no further
  Than this young man's good. He was my sister's son,
  And she was such a sister, when she lived,
  I could not prize too much; nor can I better
  Make known how dear I hold her memory,
  Than in my cherishing the only issue
  Which she hath left behind her. Who's that?

_Enter_ FIORINDA.

  _Fior._ Sir.

  _Coz._ My fair charge! you are welcome to us.

  _Fior._ I have found it, sir.

  _Coz._ All things go well in Urbin.

  _Fior._ Your gracious care to me, an orphan, frees me
  From all suspicion that my jealous fears
  Can drive into my fancy.

  _Coz._ The next summer,
  In our own person, we will bring you thither,
  And seat you in your own.

  _Fior._ When you think fit, sir.
  But, in the mean time, with your highness' pardon,
  I am a suitor to you.

  _Coz._ Name it, madam,
  With confidence to obtain it.

  _Fior._ That you would please
  To lay a strict command on Charomonte,
  To bring his daughter Lidia to the court:
  And pray you, think, sir, that 'tis not my purpose
  To employ her as a servant, but to use her
  As a most wish'd companion.

  _Coz._ Ha! your reason?

  _Fior._ The hopeful prince, your nephew, sir, hath given her
  To me for such an abstract of perfection
  In all that can be wish'd for in a virgin,
  As beauty, music, ravishing discourse,
  Quickness of apprehension, with choice manners
  And learning too, not usual with women,
  That I am much ambitious (though I shall
  Appear but as a foil to set her off)
  To be by her instructed, and supplied
  In what I am defective.

  _Coz._ Did my nephew
  Seriously deliver this?

  _Fior._ I assure your grace,
  With zeal and vehemency; and, even when,
  With his best words, he strived to set her forth,
  (Though the rare subject made him eloquent,)
  He would complain, all he could say came short
  Of her deservings.

  _Coz._ Pray you have patience.      [_Walks aside._
  This was strangely carried.--Ha! are we trifled with?
  Dare they do this? Is Cozimo's fury, that
  Of late was terrible, grown contemptible?
  Well; we will clear our brows, and undermine
  Their secret works, though they have digg'd like moles,
  And crush them with the tempest of my wrath
  When I appear most calm. He is unfit
  To command others that knows not to use it[77],
  And with all rigour: yet my stern looks shall not
  Discover my intents; for I will strike
  When I begin to frown.----You are the mistress
  Of that you did demand.

  _Fior._ I thank your highness;
  But speed in the performance of the grant
  Doubles the favour, sir.

  _Coz._ You shall possess it
  Sooner than you expect:----
  Only be pleased to be ready, when my secretary
  Waits on you, to take the fresh air. My nephew,
  And my bosom friend, so to cheat me! 'tis not fair.
                                            [_Aside._

_Re-enter_ GIOVANNI _and_ SANAZARRO.

  _Sanaz._ Where should this princess be? nor in her lodgings,
  Nor in the private walks, her own retreat,
  Which she so much frequented!

  _Giov._ By my life,
  She's with the duke! and I much more than fear
  Her forwardness to prefer my suit hath ruin'd
  What with such care we built up.

  _Coz._ Have you furnish'd
  Those coursers, as we will'd you?

  _Sanaz._ There's no sign
  Of anger in his looks.

  _Giov._ They are complete, sir.

  _Coz._ 'Tis well: to your rest. Soft sleeps wait on you, madam.
  To-morrow, with the rising of the sun,
  Be ready to ride with us.--They with more safety
  Had trod on fork-tongued adders, than provoked me.
      [_Aside, and exit._

  _Fior._ I come not to be thank'd, sir, for the speedy
  Performance of my promise touching Lidia:
  It is effected.

  _Sanaz._ We are undone.      [_Aside._

  _Fior._ The duke
  No sooner heard me with my best of language
  Describe her excellencies, as you taught me,
  But he confirm'd it.--You look sad, as if
  You wish'd it were undone.

  _Giov._ No, gracious madam,
  I am your servant for 't.

  _Fior._ Be you as careful
  For what I moved to you.--Count Sanazarro,
  Now I perceive you honour me, in vouchsafing
  To wear so slight a favour.

  _Sanaz._ 'Tis a grace
  I am unworthy of.

  _Fior._ You merit more,
  In prizing so a trifle. Take this diamond;
  I'll second what I have begun; for know,
  Your valour hath so won upon me, that
  'Tis not to be resisted: I have said, sir,
  And leave you to interpret it.             [_Exit._

  _Sanaz._ This to me
  Is wormwood. 'Tis apparent we are taken
  In our own noose. What's to be done?

  _Giov._ I know not.
  And 'tis a punishment justly fallen upon me,
  For leaving truth, a constant mistress, that
  Ever protects her servants, to become
  A slave to lies and falsehood. What excuse
  Can we make to the duke, what mercy hope for,
  Our packing[78] being laid open?

  _Sanaz._ 'Tis not to
  Be question'd but his purposed journey is
  To see fair Lidia.

  _Giov._ And to divert him
  Impossible.

  _Sanaz._ There's now no looking backward.

  _Giov._ And which way to go on with safety, not
  To be imagined.

  _Sanaz._ Give me leave: I have
  An embryon in my brain, which, I despair not,
  May be brought to form and fashion, provided
  You will be open-breasted.

  _Giov._ 'Tis no time now,
  Our dangers being equal, to conceal
  A thought from you.

  _Sanaz._ What power hold you o'er Lidia?
  Do you think that, with some hazard of her life,
  She would prevent your ruin?

  _Giov._ I presume so:
  If, in the undertaking it, she stray not
  From what becomes her innocence; and to that
  'Tis far from me to press her: I myself
  Will rather suffer.

  _Sanaz._ 'Tis enough; this night
  Write to her by your servant Calandrino,
  As I shall give directions; my man

_Enter_ CALANDRINO, _fantastically dressed._

  Shall bear him company. See, sir, to my wish
  He does appear; but much transform'd from what
  He was when he came hither.

  _Cal._ I confess
  I am not very wise, and yet I find
  A fool, so he be parcel knave, in court
  May flourish and grow rich.

  _Giov._ Calandrino.

  _Cal._ Peace!
  I am in contemplation.

  _Giov._ Do not you know me?

  _Cal._ I tell thee, no; on forfeit of my place,
  I must not know myself, much less my father,
  But by petition; that petition lined too
  With golden birds, that sing to the tune of profit,
  Or I am deaf.

  _Giov._ But you've your sense of feeling.
                           [_Offering to strike him._

  _Sanaz._ Nay, pray you, forbear.

  _Cal._ I have all that's requisite
  To the making up of a signior: my spruce ruff,
  My hooded cloak, long stocking, and paned hose,
  My case of toothpicks, and my silver fork[79];
  To convey an olive neatly to my mouth;--
  And, what is all in all, my pockets ring
  A golden peal. O that the peasants in the country,
  My quondam fellows, but saw me as I am,
  How they would admire and worship me!

  _Giov._ As they shall;
  For instantly you must thither.

  Cal. _My grand signior,
  Vouchsafe a beso las manos[80], and a cringe
  Of the last edition._

  _Giov._ You must ride post with letters
  This night to Lidia.

  _Cal._ An it please your grace,
  Shall I use my coach, or footcloth mule?

  _Sanaz._ You widgeon,
  You are to make all speed; think not of pomp.

  _Giov._ Follow for your instructions, sirrah.

  _Cal._ I have
  One suit to you, my good lord.

  _Sanaz._ What is 't?

  _Cal._ That you would give me
  A subtile court-charm, to defend me from
  The infectious air of the country.

  _Giov._ What's the reason?

  _Cal._ Why, as this court-air taught me knavish wit,
  By which I am grown rich, if that again
  Should turn me fool and honest, vain hopes farewell!
  For I must die a beggar.

  _Sanaz._ Go to, sirrah,
  You'll be whipt for this.

  _Giov._ Leave fooling, and attend us.      [_Exeunt_[81].


                      ACT IV. SCENE I.

       _The Country. A Hall in_ CHAROMONTE'_s House_.

_Enter_ CHAROMONTE _and_ LIDIA.

  _Char._ Daughter, I have observed, since the prince left us,
  (Whose absence I mourn with you,) and the visit
  Count Sanazarro gave us, you have nourish'd
  Sad and retired thoughts, and parted with
  That freedom and alacrity of spirit
  With which you used to cheer me.

  _Lid._ For the count, sir,
  All thought of him does with his person die;
  But I confess ingenuously, I cannot
  So soon forget the choice and chaste delights,
  The courteous conversation of the prince,
  And without stain, I hope, afforded me,
  When he made this house a court.

  _Char._ It is in us
  To keep it so without him. Want we know not,
  And all we can complain of, Heaven be praised for 't,
  Is too much plenty; and we will make use of

_Enter_ CAPONI, BERNARDO, PETRUCHIO, _and other Servants_.

  All lawful pleasures.--How now, fellows! when
  Shall we have this lusty dance?

  _Cap._ In the afternoon, sir.
  'Tis a device, I wis, of my own making,
  And such a one, as shall make your signiorship know
  I have not been your butler for nothing, but
  Have crotchets in my head. We'll trip it tightly,
  And make my sad young mistress merry again,
  Or I'll forswear the cellar.

  _Bern._ If we had
  Our fellow Calandrino here, to dance
  His part, we were perfect.

  _Pet._ O! he was a rare fellow;
  But I fear the court hath spoil'd him.

  _Cap._ When I was young,
  I could have cut a caper on a pinnacle;
  But now I am old and wise.--Keep your figure fair,
  And follow but the sample I shall set you,
  The duke himself will send for us, and laugh at us;
  And that were credit.

_Enter_ CALANDRINO.

  _Lid._ Who have we here?

  _Cal._ I find
  What was brawn in the country, in the court grows tender.
  The bots on these jolting jades! I am bruised to jelly.
  A coach for my money!

  _Char._ Calandrino! 'tis he.

  _Cal._ Now to my postures.--Let my hand have the honour
  To convey a kiss from my lips to the cover of
  Your foot, dear signior.

  _Char._ Fie! you stoop too low, sir.

  _Cal._ The hem of your vestment, lady: your glove is for princes;
  Nay, I have conn'd my distances.

  _Lid._ 'Tis most courtly.

  _Cap._ Fellow Calandrino!

  _Cal._ Signior de Caponi,
  Grand botelier of the mansion.

  _Bern._ How is 't, man?      [_Claps him on the shoulder._

  _Cal._ Be not so rustic in your salutations.
  Signior Bernardo, master of the accounts.
  Signior Petruchio, may you long continue
  Your function in the chamber!

  _Cap._ When shall we learn
  Such gambols in our villa?

  _Lid._ Sure he's mad.

  _Char._ 'Tis not unlike, for most of such mushrooms are so.
  What news at court?

  _Cal._ _Basta!_ they are mysteries.
  And not to be reveal'd. With your favour, signior,
  I am, in private, to confer awhile
  With this signora: but I'll pawn my honour,
  That neither my terse language, nor my habit,
  Howe'er it may convince, nor my new shrugs,
  Shall render her enamour'd.

  _Char._ Take your pleasure;
  A little of these apish tricks may pass,
  Too much is tedious.                     [_Exit._

  _Cal._ The prince, in this paper,
  Presents his service. Nay, it is not courtly
  To see the seal broke open; so I leave you.--
  Signiors of the villa, I'll descend to be
  Familiar with you.

  _Cap._ Have you forgot to dance?

  _Cal._ No, I am better'd.

  _Pet._ Will you join with us?

  _Cal._ As I like the project.
  Let me warm my brains first with the richest grape,
  And then I'm for you.

  _Cap._ We will want no wine.
                          [_Exeunt all but_ LIDIA.

  _Lid._ That this comes only from the best of princes,
  With a kind of adoration does command me
  To entertain it; and the sweet contents
                                [_Kissing the letter._
  That are inscribed here by his hand must be
  Much more than musical to me. All the service
  Of my life at no part can deserve this favour.
  O, what a virgin longing I feel on me
  To unrip the seal, and read it! yet, to break
  What he hath fastened, rashly, may appear
  A saucy rudeness in me.--I must do it,
  (Nor can I else learn his commands, or serve them,)
  But with such reverence, as I would open
  Some holy writ, whose grave instructions beat down
  Rebellious sins, and teach my better part
  How to mount upward.--So, [_opens the letter_] 'tis done, and I
  With eagle's eyes will curiously peruse it.      [_Reads._

      _Chaste Lidia, the favours are so great
      On me by you conferr'd, that to entreat
      The least addition to them, in true sense
      May argue me of blushless impudence.
      But, such are my extremes, if you deny
      A further grace, I must unpitied die.
      Haste cuts off circumstance. As you're admired
      For beauty; the report of it hath fired
      The duke my uncle, and, I fear, you'll prove,
      Not with a sacred, but unlawful love.
      If he see you as you are, my hoped-for light
      Is changed into an everlasting night;
      How to prevent it, if your goodness find,
      You save two lives, and me you ever bind,
            The honourer of your virtues_, GIOVANNI.

  Were I more deaf than adders, these sweet charms
  Would through my ears find passage to my soul,
  And soon enchant it. To save such a prince,
  Who would not perish? Virtue in him must suffer,
  And piety be forgotten. The duke's passion,
  Though it raged more than Tarquin's, shall not reach me.
  All quaint inventions of chaste virgins aid me!
  My prayers are heard; I have 't. The duke ne'er saw me--
  Or, if that fail, I am again provided--
  But for the servants!--They will take what form
  I please to put upon them. Giovanni,
  Be safe; thy servant Lidia assures it.
  Let mountains of afflictions fall on me,
  Their weight is easy, so I set thee free.      [_Exit._


                          SCENE II.

                 _Another Room in the same._

_Enter_ COZIMO, GIOVANNI, SANAZARRO, CHAROMONTE, _and Attendants_.

  _Sanaz._ Are you not tired with travel, sir?

  _Coz._ No, no;
  I am fresh and lusty.

  _Char._ This day shall be ever
  A holiday to me, that brings my prince
  Under my humble roof.                  [_Weeps._

  _Giov._ See, sir, my good tutor
  Sheds tears for joy.

  _Coz._ Dry them up, Charomonte;
  And all forbear the room, while we exchange
  Some private words together.

  _Giov._ O, my lord,
  How grossly have we overshot ourselves!

  _Sanaz._ In what, sir?

  _Giov._ In forgetting to acquaint
  My guardian with our purpose: all that Lidia
  Can do avails us nothing, if the duke
  Find out the truth from him.

  _Sanaz._ 'Tis now past help,
  And we must stand the hazard:--hope the best, sir.
   [_Exeunt_ GIOVANNI, SANAZARRO, _and Attendants_.

  _Char._ My loyalty doubted, sir!

  _Coz._ 'Tis more. Thou hast
  Abused our trust, and in a high degree
  Committed treason.

  _Char._ Treason! 'Tis a word
  My innocence understands not. Were my breast
  Transparent, and my thoughts to be discern'd,
  Not one spot shall be found to taint the candour
  Of my allegiance: and I must be bold
  To tell you, sir, (for he that knows no guilt
  Can know no fear,) 'tis tyranny to o'ercharge
  An honest man; and such, till now, I've lived,
  And such, my lord, I'll die.

  _Coz._ Sir, do not flatter
  Yourself with hope, these great and glorious words,
  Which every guilty wretch, as well as you,
  That's arm'd with impudence, can with ease deliver,
  And with as full a mouth, can work on us:
  Nor shall gay flourishes of language clear
  What is in fact apparent.

  _Char._ Fact! what fact?
  You, that know only what it is, instruct me,
  For I am ignorant.

  _Coz._ This, then, sir: We gave up,
  On our assurance of your faith and care,
  Our nephew Giovanni, nay, our heir
  In expectation, to be train'd up by you
  As did become a prince.

  _Char._ And I discharged it:
  Is this the treason?

  _Coz._ Take us with you, sir[82].
  And, in respect we knew his youth was prone
  To women, and that, living in our court,
  He might make some unworthy choice, before
  His weaker judgment was confirm'd, we did
  Remove him from it; constantly presuming,
  You, with your best endeavours, rather would
  Have quench'd those heats in him, than light a torch,
  As you have done, to his looseness.

  _Char._ I! my travail
  Is ill requited, sir; for, by my soul,
  I was so curious that way, that I granted
  Access to none could tempt him; nor did ever
  One syllable, or obscene accent, touch
  His ear, that might corrupt him.

  _Coz._ No! Why, then,
  With your allowance, did you give free way
  To all familiar privacy between
  My nephew and your daughter? Or why did you
  (Had you no other ends in 't but our service)
  Read to them, and together, as they had been
  Scholars of one form, grammar, rhetoric,
  Philosophy, story[83], and interpret to them
  The close temptations of lascivious poets?
  Or wherefore, for we still had spies upon you,
  Was she still present, when, by your advice,
  He was taught the use of his weapon, horsemanship,
  Nay, wrestling, but to fan a love in her?
  And then, forsooth, his exercises ended,
  A fair pretence of recreation for him,
  (When Lidia was instructed in those graces
  That add to beauty,) he, brought to admire her,
  Must hear her sing, while to her voice her hand
  Made ravishing music; and, this applauded, dance
  A light lavolta[84] with her.

  _Char._ Have you ended
  All you can charge me with?

  _Coz._ Nor stopt you there,
  But they must unattended walk into
  The silent groves, and hear the amorous birds
  Warbling their wanton notes; here, a sure shade
  Of barren sicamores, which the all-seeing sun
  Could not pierce through; near that, an arbour hung
  With spreading eglantine; there, a bubbling spring
  Watering a bank of hyacinths and lilies;
  With all allurements that could move to love.
  And could this, Charomonte, (should I grant
  They had been equals both in birth and fortune,)
  Become your gravity? nay, 'tis clear as air,
  That your ambitious hopes to match your daughter
  Into our family, gave connivance to it:
  And this, though not in act, in the intent
  I call high treason.

  _Char._ Hear my just defence, sir;
  And, though you are my prince, it will not take from
  Your greatness, to acknowledge with a blush,
  In this my accusation you have been
  More sway'd by spleen, and jealous suppositions,
  Than certain grounds of reason. You had a father,
  (Blest be his memory!) that made frequent proofs
  Of my loyalty and faith, and, would I boast
  The dangers I have broke through in his service,
  I could say more. Nay, you yourself, dread sir,
  Whenever I was put unto the test,
  Found me true gold, and not adulterate metal;
  And am I doubted now?

  _Coz._ This is from the purpose.

  _Char._ I will come to it, sir: Your grace well knew,
  Before the prince's happy presence made
  My poor house rich, the chiefest blessing which
  I gloried in, though now it prove a curse,
  Was an only daughter. Nor did you command me,
  As a security to your future fears,
  To cast her off: which had you done, howe'er
  She was the light of my eyes, and comfort of
  My feeble age, so far I prized my duty
  Above affection, she now had been
  A stranger to my care. But she is fair!
  Is that her fault, or mine? Did ever father
  Hold beauty in his issue for a blemish?
  You may, if you think fit, before my face,
  In recompense of all my watchings for you,
  With burning corrosives transform her to
  An ugly leper. This I will rather suffer, sir,
  Than live suspected by you.

  _Coz._ Let not passion
  Carry you beyond your reason.

  _Char._ I am calm, sir;
  Yet you must give me leave to grieve I find
  My actions misinterpreted. Alas! sir,
  Was Lidia's desire to serve the prince
  Call'd an offence? or did she practise to
  Seduce his youth, because with her best zeal
  And fervour she endeavour'd to attend him?
  'Tis a hard construction. Though she be my daughter,
  I may thus far speak her: from her infancy
  She was ever civil, her behaviour nearer
  Simplicity than craft; and malice dares not
  Affirm, in one loose gesture, or light language,
  She gave a sign she was in thought unchaste.
  I'll fetch her to you, sir; and but look on her
  With equal eyes, you must in justice grant
  That your suspicion wrongs her.

  _Coz._ It may be;
  But I must have stronger assurance of it
  Than passionate words: and, not to trifle time,
  As we came unexpected to your house,
  We will prevent all means that may prepare her
  How to answer that with which we come to charge her.
  And howsoever it may be received
  As a foul breach to hospitable rites,
  On thy allegiance and boasted faith,
  Nay, forfeit of thy head, we do confine thee
  Close prisoner to thy chamber till all doubts
  Are clear'd that do concern us.

  _Char._ I obey, sir,
  And wish your grace had followed my hearse
  To my sepulchre, my loyalty unsuspected,
  Rather than now----But I am silent, sir,
  And let that speak my duty[85].           [_Exit._

  I can't perceive the deficiency

  _Coz._ If this man
  Be false, disguised treachery ne'er put on
  A shape so near to truth. Within, there!

_Re-enter_ GIOVANNI _and_ SANAZARRO, _ushering in_ PETRONELLA.
CALANDRINO _and others setting forth a Banquet_.

  _Sanaz._ Sir.

  _Coz._ Bring Lidia forth.

  _Giov._ She comes, sir, of herself,
  To present her service to you.

  _Coz._ Ha! This personage
  Cannot invite affection.

  _Sanaz._ See you keep state.

  _Petron._ I warrant you.

  _Coz._ The manners of her mind
  Must be transcendent, if they can defend
  Her rougher outside. May we with your liking
  Salute you, lady?

  _Petron._ Let me wipe my mouth, sir,
  With my cambric handkerchief, and then have at you.

  _Coz._ Can this be possible?

  _Sanaz._ Yes, sir; you will find her
  Such as I gave her to you.

  _Petron._ Will your dukeship
  Sit down and eat some sugar-plums? Here's a castle
  Of march-pane[86] too; and this quince-marmalade was
  Of my own making; all summ'd up together,
  Did cost the setting on: and here is wine too,
  As good as e'er was tapp'd. I'll be your taster,
  For I know the fashion. [_Drinks all off._]--Now
      you must do me right, sir;
  You shall nor will nor choose.

  _Giov._ She's very simple.

  _Coz._ Simple! 'tis worse. Do you drink thus often, lady?

  _Petron._ Still when I am thirsty, and eat when I am hungry:
  Such junkets come not every day. Once more to you,
  With a heart and a half, i' faith.

  _Coz._ Pray you, pause a little.

  _Petron._ Then I'll drink for you.

  _Coz._ I'll find you out a pledge
  That shall supply my place: what think you of
  This complete signior? You are a Juno,
  And in such state must feast this Jupiter:
  What think you of him?

  _Petron._ I desire no better.

  _Coz._ And you will undertake this service for me?
  You are good at the sport.

  _Cal._ Who, I? a piddler, sir.

  _Coz._ Nay, you shall sit enthroned, and eat and drink
  As you were a duke.

  _Cal._ If your grace will have me,
  I'll eat and drink like an emperor.

  _Coz._ Take your place, then:
             [CALANDRINO _takes the duke's chair_.
  We are amazed.

  _Giov._ This is gross; nor can the imposture
  But be discover'd.

  _Sanaz._ The duke is too sharp-sighted
  To be deluded thus.

  _Cal._ Nay, pray you eat fair;
  Or divide, and I will choose. Cannot you use
  Your fork, as I do? Gape, and I will feed you.
                                      [_Feeds her._
  Gape wider yet; this is courtlike.

  _Petron._ To choke daws with:----
  I like it not.

  _Cal._ But you like this?

  _Petron._ Let it come, boy.      [_They drink._

  _Coz._ What a sight is this! We could be angry with you.
  How much you did belie her when you told us
  She was only simple! this is barbarous rudeness,
  Beyond belief.

  _Giov._ I would not speak her, sir,
  Worse than she was.

  _Sanaz._ And I, my lord, chose rather
  To deliver her better parted[87] than she is,
  Than to take from her.

_Enter_ CAPONI, _with his fellow-servants for the dance_.

  _Cap._ Ere I'll lose my dance,
  I'll speak to the purpose. I am, sir, no prologue;
  But in plain terms must tell you we are provided
  Of a lusty hornpipe.

  _Coz._ Prithee let us have it,
  For we grow dull.

  _Cap._ But to make up the medley,
  For it is of several colours, we must borrow
  Your grace's ghost here.

  _Cal._ Pray you, sir, depose me;
  It will not do else. I am, sir, the engine
                      [_Rises, and resigns his chair._
  By which it moves.

  _Petron._ I will dance with my duke too;
  I will not out.

  _Coz._ Begin then.--[_They dance._]--There's more in this
  Than yet I have discover'd. Some Oedipus
  Resolve this riddle.

  _Petron._ Did I not foot it roundly?      [_Falls._

  _Coz._ As I live, stark drunk! away with her. We'll reward you
           [_Exeunt Servants with_ PETRONELLA.
  When you have cool'd yourselves in the cellar.

  _Cap._ Heaven preserve you!

  _Coz._ We pity Charomonte's wretched fortune
  In a daughter, nay, a monster. Good old man!--
  The place grows tedious; our remove shall be
  With speed: we'll only, in a word or two,
  Take leave, and comfort him.

  _Sanaz._ 'Twill rather, sir,
  Increase his sorrow, that you know his shame;
  Your grace may do it by letter.

  _Coz._ Who sign'd you
  A patent to direct us? Wait our coming,
  In the garden.

  _Giov._ All will out.

  _Sanaz._ I more than fear it.
              [_Exeunt_ GIOVANNI _and_ SANAZARRO.

  _Coz._ These are strange chimeras to us: what to judge of 't,
  Is past our apprehension. One command
  Charomonte to attend us.      [_Exit an Attendant._]
                           Can it be
  That Contarino could be so besotted,
  As to admire this prodigy! or her father
  To dote upon it! Or does she personate,
  For some ends unknown to us, this rude behaviour,
  Which, in the scene presented, would appear
  Ridiculous and impossible?--O, you are welcome.

_Enter_ CHAROMONTE.

  We now acknowledge the much wrong we did you
  In our unjust suspicion. We have seen
  The wonder, sir, your daughter.

  _Char._ And have found her
  Such as I did report her. What she wanted
  In courtship[88], was, I hope, supplied in civil
  And modest entertainment.

  _Coz._ Pray you, tell us,
  And truly, we command you--Did you never
  Observe she was given to drink?

  _Char._ To drink, sir!

  _Coz._ Dare you trust your own eyes, if you find her now
  More than distemper'd?

  _Char._ I will pull them out, sir,
  If your grace can make this good. And if you please
  To grant me liberty, as she is I'll fetch her,
  And in a moment.

  _Coz._ Look you do, and fail not,
  On the peril of your head.

  _Char._ Drunk!--She disdains it.      [_Exit._

  _Coz._ Such contrarieties were never read of.
  Charomonte is no fool; nor can I think
  His confidence built on sand. We are abused,
  'Tis too apparent.

_Re-enter_ CHAROMONTE, _with_ LIDIA.

  _Lid._ I am indisposed, sir;
  And that life you once tender'd, much endanger'd
  In forcing me from my chamber.

  _Char._ Here she is, sir;
  Suddenly sick, I grant; but sure, not drunk:
  Speak to my lord the duke.

  _Lid._ All is discover'd.      [_Kneels._

  _Coz._ Is this your only daughter?

  _Char._ And my heir, sir;
  Nor keep I any woman in my house
  (Unless for sordid offices) but one
  I do maintain, trimm'd up in her cast habits,
  To make her sport: and she, indeed, loves wine,
  And will take too much of it; and, perhaps, for mirth,
  She was presented to you.

  _Coz._ It shall yield
  No sport to the contrivers. 'Tis too plain now.
  Her presence does confirm what Contarino
  Deliver'd of her; nor can sickness dim
  The splendour of her beauties: being herself, then,
  She must exceed his praise.

  _Lid._ Will your grace hear me?
  I'm faint, and can say little.

  _Coz._ Here are accents
  Whose every syllable is musical!
  Pray you, let me raise you, and awhile rest here.
  False Sanazarro, treacherous Giovanni!
  But stand we talking!----

  _Char._ Here's a storm soon raised.

  _Coz._ As thou art our subject, Charomonte, swear
  To act what we command.

  _Char._ That is an oath
  I long since took.

  _Coz._ Then, by that oath we charge thee,
  Without excuse, denial, or delay,
  To apprehend, and suddenly, Sanazarro,
  And our ingrateful nephew. We have said it.
  Do it without reply, or we pronounce thee,
  Like them, a traitor to us. See them guarded
  In several lodgings, and forbid access
  To all, but when we warrant. Is our will
  Heard sooner than obey'd?

  _Char._ These are strange turns;
  But I must not dispute them.          [_Exit._

  _Coz._ Be severe in 't.--
  O my abused lenity! from what height
  Is my power fall'n!

  _Lid._ O me most miserable!
  That, being innocent, makes others guilty.
  Most gracious prince----

  _Coz._ Pray you rise, and then speak to me.

  _Lid._ My knees shall first be rooted in this earth,
  And, Myrrha-like, I'll grow up to a tree,
  Dropping perpetual tears of sorrow, which
  Harden'd by the rough wind, and turn'd to amber,
  Unfortunate virgins like myself shall wear,
  Before I'll make petition to your greatness,
  But with such reverence, my hands held up thus,
  As I would do to heaven. You princes are
  As gods on earth to us, and to be sued to
  With such humility, as his deputies
  May challenge from their vassals.

  _Coz._ Here's that form
  Of language I expected; pray you, speak:
  What is your suit?

  _Lid._ That you look upon me
  As an humble thing, that millions of degrees
  Is placed beneath you: for what am I, dread sir,
  Or what can fall in the whole course of my life,
  That may be worth your care, much less your trouble?
  As the lowly shrub is to the lofty cedar,
  Or a molehill to Olympus, if compared,
  I am to you, sir. Or, suppose the prince,
  (Which cannot find belief in me,) forgetting
  The greatness of his birth and hopes, hath thrown
  An eye of favour on me, in me punish,
  That am the cause, the rashness of his youth.
  Shall the queen of the inhabitants of the air,
  The eagle, that bears thunder on her wings,
  In her angry mood destroy her hopeful young,
  For suffering a wren to perch too near them?
  Such is our disproportion.

  _Coz._ With what fervour
  She pleads against herself!

  _Lid._ For me, poor maid,
  I know the prince to be so far above me,
  That my wishes cannot reach him. Yet I am
  So much his creature, that, to fix him in
  Your wonted grace and favour, I'll abjure
  His sight for ever, and betake myself
  To a religious life, (where in my prayers
  I may remember him,) and ne'er see man more,
  But my ghostly father. Will you trust me, sir?
  In truth I'll keep my word; or, if this fail,
  A little more of fear what may befall him
  Will stop my breath for ever.

  _Coz._ Had you thus argued       [_Raises her._
  As you were yourself, and brought as advocates
  Your health and beauty to make way for you,
  No crime of his could put on such a shape
  But I should look with the eyes of mercy on it.
  What would I give to see this diamond
  In her perfect lustre, as she was before
  The clouds of sickness dimm'd it! Yet, take comfort;
  And, as you would obtain remission for
  His treachery to me, cheer your drooping spirits,
  And call the blood again into your cheeks,
  And then plead for him; and in such a habit
  As in your highest hopes you would put on,
  If we were to receive you for our bride.

  _Lid._ I'll do my best, sir.

  _Coz._ And that best will be
  A crown of all felicity to me.      [_Exeunt._



                      ACT V. SCENE I.

   _The same. An upper Chamber in_ CHAROMONTE'_s House_.

_Enter_ SANAZARRO.

  _Sanaz._ 'Tis proved in me: the curse of human frailty,
  Adding to our afflictions, makes us know
  What's good; and yet our violent passions force us
  To follow what is ill. Reason assured me
  It was not safe to shave a lion's skin;
  And that to trifle with a sovereign was
  To play with lightning: yet imperious beauty,
  Treading upon the neck of understanding,
  Compell'd me to put off my natural shape
  Of loyal duty, to disguise myself
  In the adulterate and cobweb-mask
  Of disobedient treachery. Where is now
  My borrow'd greatness, or the promised lives
  Of following courtiers echoing my will?
  In a moment vanish'd! Power that stands not on
  Its proper base, which is peculiar only
  To absolute princes, falls or rises with
  Their frown or favour. The great duke, my master,
  (Who almost changed me to his other self,)
  No sooner takes his beams of comfort from me,
  But I, as one unknown, or unregarded,
  Unpitied suffer. Who makes intercession
  To his mercy for me now? who does remember
  The service I have done him? not a man:
  And such as spake no language but my lord
  The favourite of Tuscany's grand duke,
  Deride my madness.--Ha! what noise of horses?
               [_He looks out at the back window._
  A goodly troop! This back part of my prison
  Allows me liberty to see and know them.
  Contarino! yes, 'tis he, and Lodovico[89]:
  And the duchess Fiorinda, Urbin's heir,
  A princess I have slighted: yet I wear
  Her favours; and, to teach me what I am,
  She whom I scorn'd can only mediate for me.
  This way she makes, yet speak to her I dare not;
  And how to make suit to her is a task
  Of as much difficulty.--Yes, thou blessed pledge
                                [_Takes off the ring._
  Of her affection, aid me! This supplies
  The want of pen and ink; and this, of paper.
                         [_Takes a pane of glass._
  It must be so; and I in my petition
  Concise and pithy.                       [_Exit._


FOOTNOTE:

[89] _Lodovico_,] i. e. _Lodovico Hippolito_.


                          SCENE II.

           _The Court before_ CHAROMONTE'_s House_.

_Enter_ CONTARINO, _leading in_ FIORINDA, ALPHONSO, HIPPOLITO,
HIERONIMO, _and_ CALAMINTA.

  _Fior._ 'Tis a goodly pile, this.

  _Hier._ But better by the owner.

  _Alph._ But most rich
  In the great states[90] it covers.

  _Fior._ The duke's pleasure
  Commands us hither.

  _Cont._ Which was laid on us
  To attend you to it.

  _Hip._ Signior Charomonte,
  To see your excellence his guest, will think
  Himself most happy.

  _Fior._ Tie my shoe.--[_The pane falls down._]--What's that?
  A pane thrown from the window, no wind stirring!

  _Calam._ And at your feet too fall'n:--there's something writ on 't.

  _Cont._ Some courtier, belike, would have it known
  He wore a diamond.

  _Calam._ Ha! it is directed
  To the princess Fiorinda.

  _Fior._ We will read it.      [_Reads._

      _He, whom you pleased to favour, is cast down
      Past hope of rising, by the great duke's frown,
      If, by your gracious means, he cannot have
      A pardon;--and that got, he lives your slave.
              Of men the most distressed_,
                                     SANAZARRO.

  Of me the most beloved; and I will save thee,
  Or perish with thee. Sure, thy fault must be
  Of some prodigious shape, if that my prayers
  And humble intercession to the duke

_Enter_ COZIMO _and_ CHAROMONTE.

  Prevail not with him. Here he comes; delay
  Shall not make less my benefit.

  _Coz._ What we purpose
  Shall know no change, and therefore move we not:
  We were made as properties, and what we shall
  Determine of them cannot be call'd rigour,
  But noble justice. When they proved disloyal,
  They were cruel to themselves. The prince that pardons
  The first affront offer'd to majesty,
  Invites a second, rendering that power
  Subjects should tremble at, contemptible.
  Ingratitude is a monster, Carolo,
  To be strangled in the birth, not to be cherish'd.
  Madam, you're happily met with.

  _Fior._ Sir, I am
  An humble suitor to you; and the rather
  Am confident of a grant, in that your grace,
  When I made choice to be at your devotion,
  Vow'd to deny me nothing.

  _Coz._ To this minute
  We have confirm'd it. What's your boon?

  _Fior._ It is, sir,
  That you, in being gracious to your servant,
  The ne'er sufficiently praised Sanazarro,
  That now under your heavy displeasure suffers,
  Would be good unto yourself. His services,
  So many, and so great, (your storm of fury
  Calm'd by your better judgment,) must inform you
  Some little slip, for sure it is no more,
  From his loyal duty, with your justice cannot
  Make foul his fair deservings. Great sir, therefore,
  Look backward on his former worth, and turning
  Your eye from his offence, what 'tis I know not,
  And, I am confident, you will receive him
  Once more into your favour.

  _Coz._ You say well,
  You are ignorant in the nature of his fault;
  Which when you understand, as we'll instruct you,
  Your pity will appear a charity,
  It being conferr'd on an unthankful man,
  To be repented. He's a traitor, madam,
  To you, to us, to gratitude; and in that
  All crimes are comprehended.

  _Fior._ If his offence
  Aim'd at me only, whatsoe'er it is,
  'Tis freely pardon'd.

  _Coz._ This compassion in you
  Must make the colour of his guilt more ugly.
  The honours we have hourly heap'd upon him,
  The titles, the rewards, to the envy of
  The old nobility, as the common people,
  We now forbear to touch at, and will only
  Insist on his gross wrongs to you. You were pleased,
  Forgetting both yourself and proper greatness,
  To favour him, nay, to court him to embrace
  A happiness, which, on his knees, with joy
  He should have sued for. Who repined not at
  The grace you did him? yet, in recompense
  Of your large bounties, the disloyal wretch
  Makes you a stale; and, what he might be by you,
  Scorn'd and derided, gives himself up wholly
  To the service of another. If you can
  Bear this with patience, we must say you have not
  The bitterness of spleen, or ireful passions
  Familiar to women. Pause upon it,
  And when you seriously have weigh'd his carriage,
  Move us again, if your reason will allow it,
  His treachery known: and then, if you continue
  An advocate for him, we perhaps, because
  We would deny you nothing, may awake
  Our sleeping mercy. Carolo!

  _Char._ My lord.      [_They talk aside._

  _Fior._ To endure a rival that were equal to me,
  Cannot but speak my poverty of spirit;
  But an inferior, more: yet true love must not
  Know or degrees, or distances. Lidia may be
  As far above me in her form, as she
  Is in her birth beneath me; and what I
  In Sanazarro liked, he loves in her.
  But, if I free him now, the benefit
  Being done so timely, and confirming too
  My strength and power, my soul's best faculties being
  Bent wholly to preserve him, must supply me
  With all I am defective in, and bind him
  My creature ever. It must needs be so,
  Nor will I give it o'er thus.

  _Coz._ Does your nephew
  Bear his restraint so constantly[91], as you
  Deliver it to us?

  _Char._ In my judgment, sir,
  He suffers more for his offence to you,
  Than in his fear of what can follow it.
  For he is so collected, and prepared
  To welcome that you shall determine of him,
  As if his doubts and fears were equal to him.
  And sure he's not acquainted with much guilt,
  That more laments the telling one untruth,
  Under your pardon still, for 'twas a fault, sir,
  Than others, that pretend to conscience, do
  Their crying secret sins.

  _Coz._ No more; this gloss
  Defends not the corruption of the text.
  Urge it no more.
           [CHAROMONTE _and the others talk aside_.

  _Fior._ I once more must make bold, sir,
  To trench upon your patience. I have
  Consider'd my wrongs duly: yet that cannot
  Divert my intercession for a man
  Your grace, like me, once favour'd. I am still
  A suppliant to you, that you would vouchsafe
  The hearing his defence, and that I may,
  With your allowance, see and comfort him.
  Then, having heard all that he can allege
  In his excuse, for being false to you,
  Censure him as you please.

  _Coz._ You will o'ercome;
  There's no contending with you. Pray you, enjoy
  What you desire, and tell him, he shall have
  A speedy trial; in which, we will forbear
  To sit a judge, because our purpose is
  To rise up his accuser.

  _Fior._ All increase
  Of happiness wait on Cozimo!
                [_Exeunt_ FIORINDA _and_ CALAMINTA.

  _Alph._ Was it no more?

  _Char._ My honour's pawn'd for it.

  _Cont._ I'll second you.

  _Hip._ Since it is for the service and the safety
  Of the hopeful prince, fall what can fall, I'll run
  The desperate hazard.

  _Hier._ He's no friend to virtue
  That does decline it.
                 [_They all come forward and kneel._

  _Coz._ Ha! what sue you for?
  Shall we be ever troubled? Do not tempt
  That anger may consume you.

  _Char._ Let it, sir:
  The loss is less, though innocents we perish,
  Than that your sister's son should fall, unheard,
  Under your fury. Shall we fear to entreat
  That grace for him, that are your faithful servants,
  Which you vouchsafe the count, like us a subject?

  _Coz._ Did not we vow, till sickness had forsook
  Thy daughter Lidia, and she appear'd
  In her perfect health and beauty to plead for him,
  We were deaf to all persuasion?

  _Char._ And that hope, sir,
  Hath wrought a miracle. She is recover'd,
  And, if you please to warrant her, will bring
  The penitent prince before you.

  _Coz._ To enjoy
  Such happiness, what would we not dispense with?

  _Alph. Hip. Hier._ We all kneel for the prince.

  _Cont._ Nor can it stand
  With your mercy, that are gracious to strangers,
  To be cruel to your own.

  _Coz._ But art thou certain
  I shall behold her at the best?

  _Char._ If ever
  She was handsome, as it fits not me to say so,
  She is now much better'd.

  _Coz._ Rise; thou art but dead,
  If this prove otherwise. Lidia, appear,
  And feast an appetite almost pined to death
  With longing expectation to behold
  Thy excellencies: thou, as beauty's queen,
  Shalt censure[92] the detractors. Let my nephew
  Be led in triumph under her command;
  We'll have it so; and Sanazarro tremble
  To think whom he hath slander'd. We'll retire
  Ourselves a little, and prepare to meet
  A blessing, which imagination tells us
  We are not worthy of: and then come forth,
  But with such reverence, as if I were
  Myself the priest, the sacrifice my heart,
  To offer at the altar of that goodness
  That must or kill or save me.          [_Exit._

  _Char._ Are not these
  Strange gambols in the duke?

  _Alph._ Great princes have,
  Like meaner men, their weakness.

  _Hip._ And may use it
  Without control or check.

  _Cont._ 'Tis fit they should;
  Their privilege were less else, than their subjects'.

  _Hier._ Let them have their humours; there's no crossing them.
      [_Exeunt._




                         SCENE III.

                _A State-room in the same._

_Enter_ FIORINDA, SANAZARRO, _and_ CALAMINTA.

  _Sanaz._ And can it be, your bounties should fall down
  In showers on my ingratitude, or the wrongs
  Your greatness should revenge, teach you to pity?
  What retribution can I make, what service
  Pay to your goodness, that, in some proportion,
  May to the world express I would be thankful?
  Since my engagements are so great, that all
  My best endeavours to appear your creature
  Can but proclaim my wants, and what I owe
  To your magnificence.

  _Fior._ All debts are discharged
  In this acknowledgment: yet, since you please
  I shall impose some terms of satisfaction
  For that which you profess yourself obliged for,
  They shall be gentle ones, and such as will not,
  I hope, afflict you.

  _Sanaz._ Make me understand,
  Great princess, what they are, and my obedience
  Shall, with all cheerful willingness, subscribe
  To what you shall command.

  _Fior._ I will bind you to
  Make good your promise. First, I then enjoin you
  To love a lady, that, a noble way,
  Truly affects you; and that you would take
  To your protection and care the dukedom
  Of Urbin, which no more is mine, but yours.
  And that, when you have full possession of
  My person as my fortune, you would use me,
  Not as a princess, but instruct me in
  The duties of an humble wife, for such,
  The privilege of my birth no more remember'd,
  I will be to you. This consented to,
  All injuries are forgotten.

  _Sanaz._ I am wretched,
  In having but one life to be employ'd
  As you please to dispose it. And, believe it,
  If it be not already forfeited
  To the fury of my prince, as 'tis your gift,
  With all the faculties of my soul I'll study,
  In what I may, to serve you.

  _Fior._ I am happy

_Enter_ GIOVANNI _and_ LIDIA.

  In this assurance. What sweet lady's this?

  _Sanaz._ 'Tis Lidia, madam, she----

  _Fior._ I understand you.
  Nay, blush not; by my life, she is a rare one!
  And, if I were your judge, I would not blame you
  To like and love her. But, sir, you are mine now;
  And I presume so on your constancy,
  That I dare not be jealous.

  _Sanaz._ All thoughts of her
  Are in your goodness buried.

  _Lid._ Pray you, sir,
  Be comforted; your innocence should not know
  What 'tis to fear; and if that you but look on
  The guards that you have in yourself, you cannot.
  The duke's your uncle, sir, and, though a little
  Incensed against you, when he sees your sorrow,
  He must be reconciled. What rugged Tartar,
  Or cannibal, though bathed in human gore,
  But, looking on your sweetness, would forget
  His cruel nature, and let fall his weapon,
  Though then aim'd at your throat?

  _Giov._ O Lidia,
  Of maids the honour, and your sex's glory!
  It is not fear to die, but to lose you,
  That brings this fever on me. I will now
  Discover to you, that which, till this minute,
  I durst not trust the air with. Ere you knew
  What power the magic of your beauty had,
  I was enchanted by it, liked, and loved it,
  My fondness still increasing with my years;
  And, flatter'd by false hopes, I did attend
  Some blessed opportunity to move
  The duke with his consent to make you mine:
  But now, such is my star-cross'd destiny,
  When he beholds you as you are, I may
  As well entreat him give away his crown,
  As to part from a jewel of more value.
  Yet, howsoever, when you are his duchess,
  And I am turn'd into forgotten dust,
  Pray you, love my memory:--I should say more,
  But I'm cut off.

_Enter_ COZIMO, CHAROMONTE, CONTARINO, HIERONIMO, HIPPOLITO, _and_
ALPHONSO.

  _Sanaz._ The duke! That countenance, once,
  When it was clothed in smiles, show'd like an angel's,
  But, now 'tis folded up in clouds of fury,
  'Tis terrible to look on.

  _Lid._ Sir.

  _Coz._ A while
  Silence your musical tongue, and let me feast
  My eyes with the most ravishing object that
  They ever gazed on. There's no miniature
  In her fair face, but is a copious theme
  Which would, discoursed at large of, make a volume.
  What clear arch'd brows! what sparkling eyes! the lilies
  Contending with the roses in her cheeks,
  Who shall most set them off. What ruby lips!--
  Or unto what can I compare her neck,
  But to a rock of crystal? every limb
  Proportion'd to love's wish, and in their neatness
  Add lustre to the riches of her habit,
  Not borrow from it.

  _Lid._ You are pleased to show, sir,
  The fluency of your language, in advancing
  A subject much unworthy.

  _Coz._ How! unworthy?
  By all the vows which lovers offer at
  The Cyprian goddess' altars, eloquence
  Itself presuming, as you are, to speak you,
  Would be struck dumb!--And what have you deserved then,
      [GIOVANNI _and_ SANAZARRO _kneel_.
  (Wretches, you kneel too late,) that have endeavour'd
  To spout the poison of your black detraction
  On this immaculate whiteness? Was it malice
  To her perfections? or----

  _Fior._ Your highness promised
  A gracious hearing to the count.

  _Lid._ And prince too:
  Do not make void so just a grant.

  _Coz._ We will not:
  Yet, since their accusation must be urged,
  And strongly, ere their weak defence have hearing,
  We seat you here, as judges, to determine
  Of your gross wrongs and ours. [_Seats the Ladies
      in the chairs of state._] And now, remembering
  Whose deputies you are, be neither sway'd
  Or with particular spleen, or foolish pity,
  For neither can become you.

  _Char._ There's some hope yet,
  Since they have such gentle judges.

  _Coz._ Rise, and stand forth, then,
  And hear, with horror to your guilty souls,
  What we will prove against you. Could this princess,
  Thou enemy to thyself, [_To_ SANAZARRO.] stoop her high flight
  Of towering greatness to invite thy lowness
  To look up to it, and with nimble wings
  Of gratitude couldst thou forbear to meet it?
  Were her favours boundless in a noble way,
  And warranted by our allowance, yet,
  In thy acceptation, there appear'd no sign
  Of a modest thankfulness?

  _Fior._ Pray you, forbear
  To press that further; 'tis a fault we have
  Already heard, and pardon'd.

  _Coz._ We will then
  Pass over it, and briefly touch at that
  Which does concern ourself; in which both being
  Equal offenders, what we shall speak points
  Indifferently at either. How we raised thee,
  Forgetful Sanazarro! of our grace,
  To a full possession of power and honours,
  It being too well known, we'll not remember.
  And what thou wert, rash youth, in expectation,
                                    [_To_ GIOVANNI.
  And from which headlong thou hast thrown thyself,
  Not Florence, but all Tuscany, can witness
  With admiration. To assure thy hopes,
  We did keep constant to a widow'd bed,
  And did deny ourself those lawful pleasures
  Our absolute power and height of blood allow'd us;
  Made both, the keys that open'd our heart's secrets,
  And what you spake, believed as oracles:
  But you, in recompense of this, to him
  That gave you all, to whom you owed your being,
  With treacherous lies endeavour'd to conceal
  This jewel from our knowledge, which ourself
  Could only lay just claim to.

  _Giov._ 'Tis most true, sir.

  _Sanaz._ We both confess a guilty cause.

  _Coz._ Look on her.
  Is this a beauty fit to be embraced
  By any subject's arms? can any tire
  Become that forehead but a diadem?
  Or, should we grant your being false to us
  Could be excused, your treachery to her,
  In seeking to deprive her of that greatness
  (Her matchless worth consider'd) she was born to,
  Must ne'er find pardon. We have spoken, ladies,
  Like a rough orator, that brings more truth
  Than rhetoric to make good his accusation;
  And now expect your sentence.
            [_The Ladies descend from the state[93]._

  _Lid._ In your birth, sir,
  You were mark'd out the judge of life and death,
  And we, that are your subjects, to attend,
  With trembling fear, your doom.

  _Fior._ We do resign
  This chair, as only proper to yourself.

  _Giov._ And, since injustice we are lost, we fly
  Unto your saving mercy.                 [_All kneeling._

  _Sanaz._ Which sets off
  A prince much more than rigour.

  _Char._ And becomes him,
  When 'tis express'd to such as fell by weakness,
  That being a twin-born brother to affection,
  Better than wreaths of conquest.

  _Hier. Hip. Cont. Alph._ We all speak
  Their language, mighty sir.

  _Coz._ You know our temper,
  And therefore with more boldness venture on it:
  And, would not our consent to your demands
  Deprive us of a happiness hereafter
  Ever to be despair'd of, we, perhaps,
  Might hearken nearer to you; and could wish
  With some qualification, or excuse,
  You might make less the mountains of your crimes,
  And so invite our clemency to feast with you.
  But you, that knew with what impatiency
  Of grief we parted from the fair Clarinda,
  Our duchess, (let her memory still be sacred!)
  And with what imprecations on ourself
  We vow'd, not hoping e'er to see her equal,
  Ne'er to make trial of a second choice,
  If nature framed not one that did excel her,
  As this maid's beauty prompts us that she does:--
  And yet, with oaths then mix'd with tears, upon
  Her monument we swore our eye should never
  Again be tempted;--'tis true, and those vows
  Are register'd above, something here tells me.--
  Carolo, thou heard'st us swear.

  _Char._ And swear so deeply,
  That if all women's beauties were in this,
  (As she's not to be named with the dead duchess,)
  Nay, all their virtues bound up in one story,
  (Of which mine is scarce an epitome,)
  If you should take her as a wife, the weight
  Of your perjuries would sink you. If I durst,
  I had told you this before.

  _Coz._ 'Tis strong truth, Carolo:
  And yet what was necessity in us
  Cannot free them from treason.

  _Char._ There's your error:
  The prince, in care to have you keep your vows
  Made unto Heaven, vouchsafed to love my daughter[94].

  Surely Massinger intended that his characters should here be
  understood as speaking the truth. The contrivance by which
  he exculpates Giovanni is a clumsy one; but he was anxious
  to conclude his play, and took the first that suggested itself.
  Awkward as it may appear to the reader, it has, perhaps,
  quite enough dramatic probability to satisfy an audience

  _Lid._ He told me so, indeed, sir.

  _Fior._ And the count
  Averr'd as much to me.

  _Cos._ You all conspire,
  To force our mercy from us.

  _Char._ Which given up,
  To aftertimes preserves you unforsworn:
  An honour which will live upon your tomb
  When your greatness is forgotten.

  _Coz._ Though we know
  All this is practice[95], and that both are false,
  Such reverence we will pay to dead Clarinda,
  And to our serious oaths, that we are pleased
  With our own hand to blind our eyes, and not
  Know what we understand. Here, Giovanni,
  We pardon thee; and take from us, in this,
  More than our dukedom: love her. As I part
  With her, all thoughts of women fly fast from us.
  Sanazarro, we forgive you: in your service
  To this princess, merit it. Yet let not others
  That are in trust and grace, as you have been,
  By the example of our lenity,
  Presume upon their sovereign's clemency.

_Enter_ CALANDRINO _and_ PETRONELLA.

  _All._ Long live great Cozimo!

  _Cal._ Sure the duke is
  In the giving vein, they are so loud. Come on, spouse;
  We have heard all, and we will have our boon too.

  _Coz._ What is it?

  _Cal._ That your grace, in remembrance of
  My share in a dance, and that I play'd your part
  When you should have drunk hard, would get this signior's grant
  To give this damsel to me in the church,
  For we are contracted. In it you shall do
  Your dukedom pleasure.

  _Coz._ How?

  _Cal._ Why, the whole race
  Of such as can act naturally fools' parts
  Are quite worn out; and they that do survive
  Do only zany us: and we will bring you,
  If we die not without issue, of both sexes
  Such chopping mirth-makers, as shall preserve
  Perpetual cause of sport, both to your grace
  And your posterity, that sad melancholy
  Shall ne'er approach you.

  _Coz._ We are pleased in it,
  And will pay her portion.----[_Comes forward._
                            _May the passage prove,
  Of what's presented, worthy of your love
  And favour, as was aim'd; and we have all
  That can in compass of our wishes fall._      [_Exeunt._
